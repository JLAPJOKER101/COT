Its hard to believe that Googles Street View has been in use for over four years. Whats more amazing, perhaps, given the rate at which they have canvassed the worlds streets and alleyways, that there is anywhere left unmapped. But while their teams have successfully traced the surfaces of most large cities and a number of other interesting areas, I suppose it wont come as a surprise that the remote reaches of the Amazon have not yet been put under the lens.They aim to change that, however, and have detailed in a blog post their plans to Street-View-ize a large section of the river. Its being done in collaboration with the Foundation for a Sustainable Amazon, a nonprofit working in the area.To map the entire length of the Amazon, its tributaries, and distributaries, is the work of years, however, so Google wont be attempting that just yet (though there are plenty of spots to drop the orange guy if youre curious). For now, theyre focusing their efforts on a 50km stretch of the Rio Negro starting around Manaus, right about at the center of this image:Theyll also be going down the dirt paths to small villages with the Street View Trike, mapping all the while, and will set up the tripod they use to show business interiors to give a panoramic taste of village life. And as a little parting shot of charity, theyll be leaving behind some equipment, probably some cameras and laptops, for FAS and the locals to use. The whole thing is sort of a publicity play for sustainability, not that theres anything wrong with that.No word on when the project will be complete  from what Ive read (travelogues from the 1800s, but still), these kinds of trips generally take longer than expected  but you can see some more pictures of their work over at the Google blog post.
