Former Prime Minister Yulia V. Tymoshenko will boycott her appeal of a seven-year sentence for abuse of office, her lawyers said Thursday, calling the case a farce. Ms. Tymoshenko was convicted of overstepping her powers in forcing through a gas deal with Russia in 2009 in a case widely seen as politically motivated. She appealed the conviction but said Thursday that there was no hope for a fair trial.
