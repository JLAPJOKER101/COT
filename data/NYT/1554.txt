The United Nations Security Council expressed &ldquo;indignation&rdquo; on Monday at an attack that killed 30 civilians in Ivory Coast, and pledged the crime &ldquo;shall not remain unpunished.&rdquo; The civilians were killed Thursday when missiles, believed to have been fired by forces loyal to the strongman Laurent Gbagbo, were fired into a suburb of Abidjan. Rebels backing Mr. Gbagbo&rsquo;s rival, Alassane Ouattara, seized a fifth town in the west on Monday, that of Blolequin. In Abidjan, Mr. Gbagbo bolstered his army as thousands of supporters turned out to answer his call to enlist.
