MEXICO CITY (AP) &mdash; Mexican investigators have found a total of 116 bodies in pits near the border with the United States, 28 more than previously reported, Attorney General Marisela Morales said Tuesday.        

The victims are believed to have been kidnapped from intercity buses traveling to the United States border.        

Mr. Morales said a total of 17 suspects had been detained in connection with the killings in the northern state of Tamaulipas.        

Interior Secretary Francisco Blake Mora pledged to increase the number of troops in the area where the killings occurred and to not leave the area until the killers and drug gang members had been caught.        

The graves were found recently in the township of San Fernando.        

The police say witnesses have told them that gunmen had been pulling people, mostly young men, off passenger buses traveling through the San Fernando area in late March. The authorities say the abductions were carried out by the Zetas drug gang, the same group accused in the killings of 72 migrants last August in the same area.        

The motive for the abductions remains unclear, though prosecutors have suggested that the gang may have been forcibly recruiting people.        

San Fernando is about 90 miles south of Brownsville, Tex., on a well-traveled stretch of highway that runs near the Gulf Coast in an area regularly patrolled by the Mexican military.        

The Zetas and rival Gulf Cartel are fighting in Tamaulipas over lucrative drug transit routes to the United States.        

The authorities are working to identify the bodies. One is from Guatemala, the government of that country said. The victim has been identified as Feliciano Tagual Ovalle, 44, the Guatemalan Foreign Ministry said in a statement late Monday. The statement did not say whether the man was a migrant passing through or a resident of Mexico. Mexican authorities said another was a man from central Mexico.
