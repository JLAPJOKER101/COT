WASHINGTON&mdash;Robert M. Gates has 15 days left as secretary of defense &mdash; just ask him &mdash; and has become ever more unleashed from the constraints of the job.        

So in a hearing on Wednesday, when Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, demanded to know how long the United States would support Pakistan, or as he put it, &ldquo;governments that lie to us,&rdquo; Mr. Gates, a former director of the Central Intelligence Agency, had an unvarnished answer.        

&ldquo;Well, first of all, I would say based on 27 years in C.I.A. and four-and-a-half years in this job, most governments lie to each other,&rdquo; Mr. Gates said in his flat Kansas twang. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way business gets done.&rdquo;        

The crowd in the Senate Appropriations Committee hearing room laughed, but Mr. Leahy pressed on.        

&ldquo;Do they also arrest people that help us?&rdquo; Mr. Leahy testily inquired, referring to Pakistan&rsquo;s arrest of some of the Pakistani informants who fed information to the C.I.A. in the months before the raid that led to Osama bin Laden&rsquo;s death.        

&ldquo;Sometimes,&rdquo; Mr. Gates said placidly, and then added, &ldquo;And sometimes they send people to spy on us, and they&rsquo;re our close allies.&rdquo;        

The hearing was Mr. Gates&rsquo;s last appearance before Congress as defense secretary and it is safe to say that for him, it did not come a moment too soon. Mr. Gates has increasingly lost patience with what he considers the most unappetizing part of the job, testifying to the House and Senate, where he has been grilled about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the Pentagon budget, repealing &ldquo;don&rsquo;t ask, don&rsquo;t tell&rdquo; and dozens of other contentious issues.        

Wednesday&rsquo;s hearing, to answer questions about the $671 billion the Pentagon is requesting from Congress for next year, was in fact mostly a lovefest as members of the committee lavished praise on Mr. Gates. On June 30 he is to walk out of the Pentagon and into a life of writing books lakeside near Seattle.        

&ldquo;Secretary Gates, I look forward to you coming home to our home state,&rdquo; Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington, said at one point in the hearing. &ldquo;I know you must be looking forward to that.&rdquo;        

&ldquo;Fifteen days,&rdquo; Mr. Gates replied, to laughter.        

At another point, Mr. Gates referred to a NATO fund to pay for the training of the Afghan security forces as &ldquo;a joke&rdquo; because of paltry contributions from the European allies.        

&ldquo;It&rsquo;s about 350 million euros at a time when the United States is spending billions of dollars to support the development of those military forces,&rdquo; Mr. Gates said, echoing tough remarks he made last week in Brussels about how NATO was not contributing enough to the war in Afghanistan.        

At another point, Mr. Gates defended President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan, who frequently criticizes the United States, particularly when Afghan civilians die in airstrikes, and who has exasperated the Obama administration since its inception.        

&ldquo;Yes, he reacts publicly to things that are done and said,&rdquo; Mr. Gates said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s very sensitive to civilian casualties. This has been a continuing theme. It&rsquo;s not a surprising theme.&rdquo;        

Mr. Gates made no comment on the size of the American troop withdrawal scheduled for July, now under debate at the White House. But he did say that he had had conversations with President Obama about the forces to be left behind.&ldquo;This is not a war without end,&rdquo; he vowed to the senators.        

In Afghanistan, meanwhile, a mortar shell narrowly missed several senior government officials, including a vice president, at the opening of a new police training center outside Kabul, the capital. No one was injured. In addition, suicide bombers attacked government buildings in two provinces, killing at least 11 people, The Associated Press reported.
