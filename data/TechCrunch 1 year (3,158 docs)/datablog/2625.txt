Oh Yahoo!, you silly ol thing! According to an email that just came in from Yahoos digital marketing agency Something Massive, the struggling content company (platform company? advertising company?) wants us to talk about, tweet about and Facebook about their Yahoo! News Activity feature, and in return the company is promising lots of links and SEO juice. In case we forgot what Yahoo! News is, they helpfully linked to a TechCrunch post detailing the services social upgrade in September.Well, here you go, Yahoo. Youre welcome. Can you please send over those half a million impressions you promised now? (P.S. By the way, TechCrunch is all one word.)Dear Sarah,My name is [redacted] and I work for Yahoo!s digital marketing agency.

We think youre writing on Tech Crunch is great and that you reach an audience with a natural tendency to share and discover new things with their friends.The F8 announcement was about a new product from Yahoo and Facebook called Yahoo! News Activity.
