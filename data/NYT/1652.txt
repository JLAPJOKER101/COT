An American who drugged her husband, an investment banker, with a milkshake and bludgeoned him to death more than seven years ago was convicted of murder on Friday at her second trial. The unanimous verdict and automatic life sentence match the outcome of the first trial against Nancy Kissel, whose lawyers argued she was a battered, clinically depressed wife who acted under diminished responsibility when her husband provoked her attack. Prosecutors argued that Robert Kissel&rsquo;s death in November 2003 was a carefully planned murder Ms. Kissel tried to conceal. In opening statements in January, they said she struck at least five blows to her husband&rsquo;s head with a metal ornament while he lay face down in the bedroom, subdued by six drugs mixed in a milkshake. Mr. Kissel worked for Merrill Lynch, and his estate was worth $18 million in life insurance, stocks and properties, according to prosecutors.
