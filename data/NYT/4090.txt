Sri Lanka on Monday acknowledged for the first time that civilian casualties occurred in the final phase of its 26-year war against Tamil Tiger rebels, but called the deaths unavoidable. The Defense Ministry statement was a reversal from its previous insistence that its troops adhered to a &ldquo;zero civilian casualty policy.&rdquo; However the report said &ldquo;it was impossible&rdquo; to avoid civilian deaths. The report denies that troops committed rights violations and executed prisoners. The United Nations in April found credible evidence of such violations.
