Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said Monday that he had no alternative but to send police to forcibly end a peaceful anti-graft protest by a popular yoga guru and thousands of his followers. &ldquo;It is unfortunate that operation had to be conducted, but quite honestly there was no alternative,&rdquo; he said, according to the Press Trust of India news agency. Mr. Singh spoke after the Supreme Court called on the government to justify its actions.
