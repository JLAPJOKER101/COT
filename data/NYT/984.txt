russia The former Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev described Russia on Monday as an imitation of democracy and accused its current leaders of  contempt for voters in his harshest criticism of the government. Mr. Gorbachev, left, criticized Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin and his prot&eacute;g&eacute;, President Dmitri A. Medvedev, for saying that they would decide  who should run for president next year. He called the statements a show of &ldquo;incredible conceit&rdquo; and disrespect for voters. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not Putin&rsquo;s business,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It must be decided by the nation in the elections, by those who would cast ballots. Can&rsquo;t other people also run?&rdquo;
