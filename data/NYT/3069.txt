JUBA, Sudan &mdash; Fighting spread to a city in a heavily militarized part of Sudan on Monday, United Nations officials said, as the northern Sudanese army appeared to be trying to disarm militias and forces aligned with southern Sudan.        

On Sunday, members of the southern military raided a police station in the city of Kadugli, looting weapons, United Nations officials said. Clashes broke out Sunday evening between the northern and southern armies about 60 miles away, they said.        

On Monday evening, fighting broke out in Kadugli, with 10 tanks from the northern army stationed throughout the town, said Hua Jiang, a spokeswoman for the United Nations in Sudan. Kadugli is the capital of Southern Kordofan State and the largest city in the subregion of Nuba Mountains, which has become a center of tension between northern- and southern-aligned forces.        

&ldquo;This is a disarmament process,&rdquo; said Rabie A. Atti, a spokesman for the northern government. &ldquo;They are now going ahead.&rdquo;        

Southern Sudan is scheduled to become independent on July 9, after 50 years of civil war between the Arab north and African south. In January, southerners voted overwhelmingly, by nearly 99 percent, to secede.        

Many people in Southern Kordofan, as well as nearby Blue Nile State &mdash; both part of the north, but bordering the south &mdash; fought alongside the south during the civil war, with the goal of overthrowing the government, not becoming independent. According to a peace agreement brokered by the United States in 2005, the two states are to hold their own, somewhat ambiguous &ldquo;consultations&rdquo; on their future.        

But late last month, the Sudanese Army invaded the contested area of Abyei, and it threatened to do the same in Blue Nile and Southern Kordofan. Tens of thousands of Abyei residents fled the invasion there.
