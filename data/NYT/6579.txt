A Ukrainian organization of topless female activists said Tuesday that three members were abducted by Belarussian security officers, beaten, humiliated and left naked in a forest. The group, Femen, has become widely known in Ukraine and neighboring countries for its demonstrations in which women bare their breasts to draw attention to a variety of causes. A statement on Femen&rsquo;s Web site said the three women were seized by agents of the Belarussian K.G.B. at Minsk&rsquo;s train station on Monday evening, several hours after they held a protest against the authoritarian president, Aleksandr G. Lukashenko. A K.G.B. spokesman would not comment.
