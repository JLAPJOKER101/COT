Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi survived a pair of political tests on Thursday. First, Parliament denied a request by prosecutors to search his offices as part of an investigation into whether he paid a number of young women for sex. He also weathered a crisis in his coalition when his cabinet approved a measure giving cities a larger role in taxation. The Northern League, the leading party in the coalition, had said it would call for early elections if the measure failed.
