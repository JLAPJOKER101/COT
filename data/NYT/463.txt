An explosion at a coal mine in northeastern Colombia killed as many as 20 miners and left six injured, according to a statement from the Colombian Institute of Geology and Mining. The disaster was caused by the release of methane gas that led to a blast and a cave-in. Dozens of people were killed in similar accidents last year in Colombia, South America&rsquo;s largest coal producer. More than 30 miners died at the same mine, called La Preciosa, in 2007.
