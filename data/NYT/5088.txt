NATO peacekeeping forces clashed with Serb protesters in northern Kosovo on Tuesday, leaving 11 people wounded, officials said. The fighting occurred near a disputed border crossing between Kosovo and Serbia, which refuses to recognize Kosovo&rsquo;s 2008 declaration of independence. A NATO spokesman, Lt. Col. Kai Gudenoge, said the clash began when the Serb protesters threw pipe bombs at the peacekeepers, wounding four of them. The soldiers fired weapons at the Serbs, he said. A hospital official said seven Serb protesters were wounded, but Colonel Gudenoge said only one had been shot by NATO forces. A senior Serb leader in Kosovo placed blame for the violence on American peacekeepers deployed at the border crossing.
