CAIRO &mdash; The news came without warning or detail at 6:05 p.m. Thousands roared their approval and hundreds ran to join them in the square. The president was gone, and Egypt seemed reborn.        

The news came as men and women were in the middle of their prayers, but for the people around them, the celebration could not wait. Some people cried, some kissed the ground, and at some point, nearly everyone hugged a stranger. When the prayers ended and the worshipers stood, the people chanted together &mdash; elated, proud and relieved.        

&ldquo;You&rsquo;re an Egyptian,&rdquo; they said. &ldquo;Lift your head high.&rdquo;        

People fumbled with their cellphones to figure out what, exactly, had happened, but signals were hard to get and rumors circulated. Now that the army had taken over, some speculated that the president had fled to Dubai or London. The vice president was in charge, or maybe not.        

It mattered little. Balloons fell on a row of people lighted by holiday lanterns. &ldquo;God is great, my son,&rdquo; a man said into his cellphone. &ldquo;God is great.&rdquo;        

&ldquo;We&rsquo;re inside,&rdquo; the crowd roared. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s outside.&rdquo;        

Inside was Tahrir Square, the birthplace of the uprising and a place that, to many here, felt like a dream, about what Egypt should be like.        

It was nothing like Egypt outside the square. Guarded by soldiers, tanks and patchwork barriers, every voice was heard and everyone chipped in. People of varying ideologies, religions and classes had achieved the same goal, shared the same joy.        

It was hard to recall what it looked like on Jan. 25, the first day of major protests, when riot police officers huddled in trucks and President Hosni Mubarak&rsquo;s plainclothes police officers snatched protesters off the sidewalks.        

Now, it was the seat of a revolution. &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t calling it a revolution&rdquo; before the president stepped down, said Ahmed el-Droubi. But now, it was.        

On a high balcony, a man sprayed a plume of fire from an aerosol can, and a teenager danced atop a lamppost. Someone hauled a smiling young soldier onto his shoulders, and young men ran from group to group, shopping for their favorite slogans.        

&ldquo;Egypt&rsquo;s free and Hosni&rsquo;s out.&rdquo;        

Together they were deafening, but on their own, some people searched for words.        

&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to say,&rdquo; Khaled Sayed Mohamed said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the end of injustice, the end of corruption. We smell freedom,&rdquo; he went on, finding the words.        

&ldquo;I cannot describe my emotions,&rdquo; said Ahmed Zayed, who stood in the square with his wife, Marwa, who added, &ldquo;This cost us a lot.&rdquo;        

&ldquo;We took our freedom,&rdquo; Mustafa Abdurasheed Muhanna said. &ldquo;Egypt is born again.&rdquo;        

So was the Egyptian flag, no longer seen as a symbol of a stagnant state, a bureaucrat&rsquo;s wall decoration or a backdrop for state television broadcasts of Mr. Mubarak&rsquo;s meetings.        

In the square on Friday, it was a woman&rsquo;s shawl, a child&rsquo;s plaything and a cherished accessory. Sold for $2, it was marked in black pen with political slogans or signed like a yearbook. Everywhere, the flags waved.        

The day had started with uncertainty and anger. Early Friday afternoon, hundreds of thousands of protesters filled the square to press their demands after Mr. Mubarak&rsquo;s confounding speech on Thursday night in which he seemed determined to cling to power.        

By late afternoon, many of the protesters appeared exhausted. But by 7 p.m. there were fireworks. For maybe the last time, the protesters held up their signs. A woman carried one that read &ldquo;Facebook 2, Arab leaders 0,&rdquo; referring to the protests that had toppled the president of Tunisia, and energized Mr. Mubarak&rsquo;s opponents.        

One sign held by a young man said: &ldquo;Mubarak: Enter + Shift + Delete.&rdquo; Moawia Mohamed, 20, held another that said, &ldquo;Welcome to the New Egypt.&rdquo;        

He had stayed in the square for 12 days, and now, he planned to go home. &ldquo;He left,&rdquo; Mr. Mohamed said, echoing a popular chant. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll leave.&rdquo;        

By 7:30 p.m., protesters seemed to know that the military had been handed control of the country. That caused worries but did not spoil a victory.        

&ldquo;We have to take the risk,&rdquo; said Yasmine Abu Samra, a 29-year-old engineer. &ldquo;The army is in control now, and that&rsquo;s a risk I&rsquo;m willing to take.&rdquo;        

Mohamed Hassan, who owns a factory, said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m happy and scared. I am scared of tomorrow. I&rsquo;m scared they steal away our happiness like they did yesterday.&rdquo;        

There was little sympathy for yesterday&rsquo;s ruler. On one sign, Mr. Mubarak was depicted as pig. Graffiti on a wall referred to the &ldquo;Antique Dictator.&rdquo; There were curses about his sons, and many calls for him to be put on trial.        

But the focus had shifted from the uprising&rsquo;s early days, and now the protesters lingered on their own achievement. Near a vendor selling sweet potatoes, the crowd yelled: &ldquo;The Egyptians are here! Here, here, here!&rdquo;        

Mohamed Abd El-Khalek held a sign that read &ldquo;Finally proud to be an Egyptian.&rdquo; For days, he had stayed away from the protests, believing state television anchors who said the movement was filled with troublemakers and foreigners. The rest of his sign admitted his mistake. &ldquo;I was wrong, you were right.&rdquo;        

&ldquo;I had to go see for myself,&rdquo; he said, as someone behind him waved a Tunisian flag. &ldquo;I found something amazing that will never be repeated again. If he left on the first day,&rdquo; he said, referring to Mr. Mubarak, &ldquo;this never would have happened.&rdquo;        

It came at a cost, visible in posters of protesters killed during the uprising. There was talk of renaming the square for them. For the moment, it had a name, now famous, that people kept repeating again and again, as they bragged to their friends about where they were standing.        

&ldquo;I&rsquo;m in Tahrir Square!&rdquo; a man yelled into a phone, spreading the word. &ldquo;In freedom, in freedom, in freedom!&rdquo;
