Parliament has voted to reopen a debate on a bill that seeks to outlaw homosexuality and that could be expanded to include the death penalty for gay men and lesbians. The legislation, first proposed in 2009, will be sent to a committee for consideration, Speaker Rebecca Kadaga told lawmakers. The Legal and Parliamentary Affairs Committee in the previous Parliament suggested that the penalty for &ldquo;aggravated homosexuality&rdquo; should be the same as for &ldquo;defilement,&rdquo; a crime that is punishable by death.
