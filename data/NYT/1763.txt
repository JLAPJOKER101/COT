A protest by more than 2,000 residents of Suijiang County in Yunnan Province that lasted for five days was dispersed on Tuesday by paramilitary police officers and armored vehicles, according to Chinese news reports and a posting on the Web site of the county&rsquo;s government. The protest, one of the largest in China in recent memory, erupted because of heated disputes between residents and the government over compensation for seized land, a common source of conflict in China. The Internet post by the government said the protesters blocked roads and threatened businesses, and so the government had to call in hundreds of riot police officers to intervene. Injuries were reported.
