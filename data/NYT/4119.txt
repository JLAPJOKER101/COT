Air traffic controllers in Germany called off a strike over pay that had been planned for Thursday, sparing thousands of vacationers flight delays and cancellations. The air traffic controller&rsquo;s union had earlier appealed against an injunction to stop the strike. A spokesman said that the air traffic controllers&rsquo; union had decided to abandon the strike, saying that a decision on the appeal would come too late and therefore cause too much disruption.
