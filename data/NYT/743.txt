President Nicolas Sarkozy tried to put a lid on the political furor over senior ministers&rsquo;  taking free flights in Tunisia and Egypt last Christmas by telling his cabinet to vacation in France.  Mr. Sarkozy said that government ministers would now have to get permission from the prime minister&rsquo;s office before accepting invitations to visit other countries. Prime Minister Fran&ccedil;ois Fillon vacationed with his family last year at the invitation and expense of the Egyptian government.   Foreign Minister Mich&egrave;le Alliot-Marie vacationed in Tunisia when demonstrations were already under way and accepted two free flights from a businessman close to the family of Tunisia&rsquo;s president, who was later ousted.
