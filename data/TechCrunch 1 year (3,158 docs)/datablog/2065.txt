Enterprise cloud app management company Okta, which allows companies to have control of their users, applications, and data both in the cloud and behind the firewall, is debuting a new self-service sign-on capability. This would allow IT organizations publish a custom app catalog to their organization and for end users to get single sign-on to over a 1,000 cloud apps.Okta is providing a platform for companies to manage corporate IT. When moving to the cloud, IT admins face the challenge of securing and controlling users and access, simplifying the adoption and scaling of these applications, and at the same time making sure that the business is optimizing its applications in the cloud.Companies who are using cloud-based applications like Salesforce and Google Apps need an identity and directory service in the cloud as a place where they can store user profiles and more. Okta gives IT managers the ability to maintain one central directory and replicate this to all cloud applications.With the single sign-on and self-service catalog, IT admins can choose to allow employees access to 1,200 cloud and web apps with a single sign-on. Basically, the new app marketplace and single sign-on allows employees to find and install the apps they need as well as increasing ITs visibility into app usage across the company.Okta recently raised $16.5 million in Series B funding from Greylock Partners, Khosla Ventures, Andreessen Horowitz and FLOODGATE.
