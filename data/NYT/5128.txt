President Ali Abdullah Saleh said Thursday that he would not step down while his strongest rivals remained in power. Mr. Saleh told The Washington Post and Time magazine that his main opponents, a general who defected and a rival clan, would have to be removed for any political transition to go through. He also procured a decree from a government-financed committee of Yemeni religious scholars declaring that it is sinful to protest against the state and that security forces are &ldquo;fighting for the sake of God.&rdquo; &ldquo;What happens at demonstrations and sit-ins in residential areas and public roads is ungodly,&rdquo; reads the decree, or fatwa. Mr. Saleh, who recently returned to Yemen after nearly four months of medical treatment in Saudi Arabia, has used such fatwas for political benefit in the past.
