KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) &mdash; The prime minister of Jamaica, Bruce Golding, will step aside in the next few weeks, the ruling party announced on Sunday. The move appeared intended to salvage the party&rsquo;s chances in the next general election, which must be held by December 2012.        

A brief announcement from the Jamaica Labor Party said Mr. Golding, 63, had decided to resign as party leader as soon as a replacement could be selected. The party&rsquo;s leader automatically becomes the prime minister.        

Mr. Golding&rsquo;s political standing never recovered from his widely criticized handling of an extradition case in 2009 and 2010. For nine months, he resisted a United States request to hand over Christopher Coke, a powerful gang leader. When Mr. Golding finally sent security officers to arrest Mr. Coke, days of fighting ensued, and at least 76 people were killed before he was captured. Mr. Coke pleaded guilty to racketeering and assault charges in August in New York.        

The dispute strained relations with the United States, which questioned Jamaica&rsquo;s reliability as an ally in the fight against drug trafficking.
