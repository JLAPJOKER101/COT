France approved the extradition of the former dictator Manuel Antonio Noriega to his native Panama, an official at the prime minister&rsquo;s office said Wednesday. According to his lawyer, Yves Leberquier, Mr. Noriega will not be extradited before September. Last year, Mr. Noriega, left, who ruled Panama from 1983 to 1989, was sentenced by a French judge to seven years in prison for laundering $3 million in Colombian drug money through international banks and into French accounts. He had previously been jailed in Miami on charges that included cocaine trafficking. The government of Panama has requested that Mr. Noriega be extradited from France in order to serve three 20-year prison terms for human rights abuses and involvement in the disappearance of political opponents.
