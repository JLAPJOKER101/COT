Up to 1,000 people turned out in the capital, Minsk, on Wednesday in a rare protest of economic hardship, defying a warning by President Aleksandr G. Lukashenko that he would &ldquo;strike hard&rdquo; against them. The police sealed off Oktyabrskaya Square in Minsk close to Mr. Lukashenko&rsquo;s main administration building, but several hundred people massed in a largely silent protest in nearby streets all the same. The demonstrators &mdash; heeding a call on social media sites for a public show of dissatisfaction with Mr. Lukashenko&rsquo;s government &mdash; displayed no slogans, and they were largely silent apart from some rhythmic clapping.        

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Mr. Lukashenko, who has ruled the former Soviet republic for 16 years and whose authoritarian style has led to sanctions by Western governments, declared Tuesday he would suppress any protests against his policies. The police made no move to intervene against the demonstrators. Signs of unrest have been growing in the tightly policed state with the onset of a severe economic crisis that has led to a 36 percent devaluation of the currency and soaring inflation.
