PARIS &mdash; France may count more than its share of iconic chain-smokers &mdash; from Jean-Paul Sartre to Alain Delon &mdash; but for two decades the country has been systematically removing cigarettes from their fingertips or lips in any advertisements that use their likenesses. This week, though, a parliamentary committee approved a bill that would give back the tobacco products those celebrities held so dear, and by which they came to be known.        

The Cultural Affairs and Education Committee of the National Assembly, the lower house of Parliament, voted Wednesday to exempt &ldquo;artistic or cultural works&rdquo; from a 1991 law that prohibits tobacco advertisements, but that also prevents the presence of tobacco in advertisements for goods of any kind. The full National Assembly is expected to approve the bill this month.        

&ldquo;In the name of a preoccupation with health, paved with good intentions, we&rsquo;re ending up changing works of art and, more concerning, history,&rdquo; a Socialist member of Parliament, Didier Mathus, told the committee, according to an official transcript. The bill cited several examples of artwork that was tampered with:        

&para;In 1996, the French postal service issued a commemorative stamp featuring the portrait of Andr&eacute; Malraux, a writer and a former minister of culture, but without the cigarette that hung from his lips in the well-known photograph on which it was based.        

&para;In 2005, in advertisements and catalog covers for a Sartre exhibit at the National Library of France, held in honor of the centennial of the philosopher&rsquo;s birth, a cigarette butt was erased from between the index and middle finger of his right hand.        

&para;In advertisements for a 2009 retrospective on the work of the filmmaker Jacques Tati, the management of Paris&rsquo;s public transportation system replaced the iconic pipe of M. Hulot, one of Mr. Tati&rsquo;s best-loved characters, with a yellow pinwheel.        

&ldquo;It was ridiculous,&rdquo; said C&eacute;cile Husson, a gravelly-voiced, 37-year-old schoolteacher, as she puffed on a cigarette on the Place Gambetta in the 20th Arrondissement. &ldquo;It didn&rsquo;t have any impact on whether people smoked or not.&rdquo;        

But she added, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re so bombarded by ads, I&rsquo;m not even sure people noticed.&rdquo;
