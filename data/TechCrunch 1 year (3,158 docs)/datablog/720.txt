		
The speaker schedule for TechCrunchs Disrupt NYC conference has been set for a while now, but three brand new presenters were just added to the lineup: The winners announced earlier today at the finale of this past weekends 24 hour Disrupt 2012 Hackathon, Thingscription, PoachBase, and PractiKhan.Since the winning apps were so seriously awesome  and we have a very, very small sadistic bent (most of these people had not slept for at least 24 hours at this point, so a video interview with bright lights was especially fun)  we pulled aside all three winning teams for interviews with TechCrunch TV backstage.Embedded above you can see our chat with the people who built the Hackathons first place winner, ThingScription, a platform to let people get subscriptions for deliveries of potentially any consumer good.And in the videos below, youll first find our interviews with three members of the five-person team that built the second-place Hackathon winner PoachBase, a web app for finding the most poach-able potential hires in the tech industry. Below that is the developer behind the third-place winner PractiKhan, an app that lets teachers create online lessons and tests utilizing content from Khan Academy.
