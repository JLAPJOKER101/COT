The governing coalition chosen after Tunisia&rsquo;s first democratic election filled the three top government posts on Monday and said it would hold new elections within one year. The prime minister will be Hamadi Jbeli, secretary general of the Islamist Ennahda party, the coalition&rsquo;s senior partner. The largely ceremonial presidency will be held by Moncef Marzouki, head of the Congress for the Republic, and Mustafa Ben Jaafar, leader of Ettakatol, will be the speaker of the assembly that will draft a new constitution.
