The governing African National Congress party in South Africa on Friday denied an effort by its firebrand youth leader, Julius Malema, to have it drop charges brought against him by a disciplinary committee that accuses him of sowing division and bringing the party into disrepute. The committee opened hearings this week to determine whether Mr. Malema, 30, should be suspended.

In past years he has also promoted a colonial-era song advocating the shooting of white settlers.
