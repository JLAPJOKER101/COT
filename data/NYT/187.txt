A senior official of the European Union, Stefan Fuele, warned Ukraine on Tuesday not to use criminal law for political ends, a clear reference to the prosecution of Yulia V. Tymoshenko, a former prime minister. Ms. Tymoshenko, 50, who lost a bitter election campaign to President Viktor F. Yanukovich last year, has been charged with abuse of office as prime minister from 2007 to 2010. Ukraine and the European Union are negotiating an association agreement. Mr. Fuele, the European Union&rsquo;s enlargement commissioner, said: &ldquo;I would like to recall the need to ensure that criminal law is not used for political ends and the principles of a fair, impartial independent legal process are fully respected.&rdquo; In response, Foreign Minister Kostyantyn Hryshchenko said that the easiest way to avoid a problem with law enforcement bodies was to make sure &ldquo;you do not break the law when you are in government, nor when you are out of it.&rdquo;
