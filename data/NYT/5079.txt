KABUL, Afghanistan &mdash; A suicide car bomber in southern Afghanistan took aim at a local merchant who sold his goods &mdash; cooking oil, bread and wood &mdash; to the local police, exploding a car in front of his grocery and bakery, killing a father and son on Tuesday.        

The clear message was to discourage anyone who dared to do business with, much less work for, the Afghan security forces. However, the two people who were killed appeared not to have had a connection to the merchant.        

The explosion in Lashkar Gah, the capital of Helmand Province, comes several months after the city&rsquo;s security was handed over to Afghan forces. Several elders said they felt security had deteriorated since then, but added that they did not think anyone could stop the attacks entirely.        

&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think the Afghan forces are able to stop these kind of attacks here,&rdquo; said Hajji Muhammed Aslam, a tribal elder in Lashkar Gah.        

A bombing that killed 11 children and 5 adults on a minibus headed to an engagement party in western Afghanistan, meanwhile, appeared to be a reminder of how long the country has been locked in conflict.        

The bomb was probably an old piece of ordnance left over from the Soviet occupation or the civil war that followed, said a spokesman for the provincial governor who noted that the bomb was planted off the road and in a place that is never traveled by NATO or Afghan security forces. He described the explosive as an antitank land mine.        

The spokesman, Mohyaddin Noori, said the van was in a convoy of vehicles bound for the party when one drove off the road to try to quickly pass other cars.        

&ldquo;This is a tragic incident that happened in the area, mainly due to the carelessness of the drivers,&rdquo; he said.
