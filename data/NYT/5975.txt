Eighteen preschoolers died Wednesday when their badly overloaded school minibus was rammed head-on by a coal truck, according to the official Xinhua news agency. The bus driver and a teacher also died, and 44 children were injured. The bus &mdash; with just nine seats, according to Xinhua &mdash; had been carrying 64 people. The crash immediately generated outrage on Twitter-like microblogs, with commentators accusing the government of poorly regulating school buses. The truck driver was taken into custody, Xinhua reported.
