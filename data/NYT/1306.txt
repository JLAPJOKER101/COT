Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., left, in meetings with Russia&rsquo;s president on Wednesday, called the country&rsquo;s accession to the World Trade Organization &ldquo;the most important item on our agenda,&rdquo; and promised that the White House would push for the repeal of cold-war-era trade restrictions. But he warned that international investors were watching closely to see whether Russia made progress on corruption and rule of law.        

&ldquo;Investors are looking for assurances that the legal system treats them fairly and acts on their concerns swiftly,&rdquo; Mr. Biden said during a visit to the Skolkovo business school. Mr. Biden, who two years ago originated the idea of a &ldquo;reset&rdquo; between Russia and the United States, is tasked with maintaining the momentum in the still-jittery relationship. Russia is looking for the United States to help promote its economic modernization, a central goal of Dmitri A. Medvedev&rsquo;s presidency.
