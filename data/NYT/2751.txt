BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) &mdash; A World Press Photo exhibit in Beirut closed early after Lebanese authorities ordered the removal of an Israeli photographer&rsquo;s prize-winning work, an organizer of the exhibit said Friday.        

A Lebanese security official said the General Security Directorate ordered the organizers to remove the work of Amit Shaal because he is Israeli. Speaking on condition of anonymity, he noted by way of explanation that the two nations were &ldquo;in a state of war.&rdquo;        

Erik de Kruijf, a World Press project manager, said the organization preferred to close the exhibit 10 days early rather than face censorship.        

&ldquo;For a week it was no problem, and then someone noticed that he is an Israeli photographer,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We cannot allow censorship of any kind, so that&rsquo;s why we decided to take everything down.&rdquo;        

The World Press award is one of the industry&rsquo;s most coveted prizes. Mr. Shaal won third prize in the arts and entertainment category.        

His photographs show street scenes in Israel in which he holds up historical photos of the same places to show past and present.        

Mr. Shaal said he was surprised by the decision, saying his work was not intended to be political. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an examination of what was once and what is now,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The viewer can reach his or her own conclusion.&rdquo;
