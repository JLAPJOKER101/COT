The Gillmor Gang: John Borthwick, Danny Sullivan, Doc Searls, Kevin Marks, and Steve Gillmor â€” struggled with Comcastic bandwidth and hours on hold as Twitter and Apple tweaked their business models. It seems that Twitter is refurbishing the accomodations within 140 characters to create a nice new home for Twitter apps, in the process giving the Flipboard to aggregators outside the mother ship.Apple, on the other hand, is opening Apple TV and the iPad to Hulu Plus and Amazon Instant Video respectively. @dannysullivan thinks its bad news for Roku fans, and Doc, whos now working on Rupert Murdochs boat, is busy stealing content from his own bad self over transcontinental Slingbox. Its TV Everywhere, except here.@stevegillmor, @dsearls, @borthwick, @dannysullivan, @kevinmarksProduced and directed by Tina Chase Gillmor @tinagillmor
