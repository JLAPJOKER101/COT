An early-morning fire gutted the historic &Eacute;lys&eacute;e Montmartre concert hall in Paris on Tuesday, French officials said. The central stage was untouched, but the second floor partially collapsed, according to news reports. Police said they suspected that the fire was caused by faulty wiring. The hall opened in 1807. Toulouse-Lautrec is reported to have painted several works there, and it is said to have been the birthplace of the cancan. &ldquo;It is a part of Paris&rsquo;s identity that has been struck,&rdquo; said Mayor Bertrand Delano&euml;, who pledged that it would be rebuilt. No one was hurt in the fire, the authorities said.
