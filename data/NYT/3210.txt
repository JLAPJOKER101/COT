Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian Authority president and Fatah party chief, and Khaled Meshal, the Damascus-based leader of the militant group Hamas, will meet in Cairo next week to try to finalize the makeup of a Palestinian unity government after lower-level talks ended Tuesday without a consensus, according to the official Palestinian news agency Wafa. Fatah, which dominates in the West Bank, and Hamas, which controls Gaza, signed a reconciliation agreement in early May. Fatah has nominated Salam Fayyad, the current prime minister of the Palestinian Authority government, to lead a unity government of independent technocrats. Hamas has rejected Mr. Fayyad as a candidate.
