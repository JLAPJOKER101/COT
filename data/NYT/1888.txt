A small bomb exploded near Egypt&rsquo;s pyramids outside Cairo on Wednesday, badly injuring three peddlers who the police said were trying to open the device&rsquo;s casing, security officials said. They said the peddlers, who sell tourist trinkets, saw the edge of the device sticking out of the sand and began hitting it with iron sticks under the impression that there were valuables inside. No extremist group has claimed responsibility for the bomb, nor have any groups made public threats against the ancient site.
