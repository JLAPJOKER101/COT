Pope Benedict XVI said Thursday  that God&rsquo;s knowledge, love and &ldquo;inexhaustible creativity&rdquo; &mdash; not chance &mdash; lay at the origins of the universe. Scientific concepts suggesting the formation of the universe was accidental, like the Big Bang theory, &ldquo;only arrive at a certain point,&rdquo; the pope told worshipers in St. Peter&rsquo;s Basilica on Thursday. The church no longer says that the process of evolution violates its teachings, but for the church, God remains the ultimate creator.
