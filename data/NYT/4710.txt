The newspaper The Guardian said Wednesday that one of its reporters, Amelia Hill, was questioned in recent days by police officers investigating leaks from the phone hacking inquiry that has enveloped Rupert Murdoch&rsquo;s newspaper group in Britain. That followed the arrest last month of a Scotland Yard detective assigned to the phone hacking investigation, a step that British news reports linked to Guardian reports on the scandal. In a statement confirming that Ms. Hill had been questioned in connection with &ldquo;alleged leaks,&rdquo; The Guardian raised concerns about the implications for reporters&rsquo;&nbsp;relations with their sources.&nbsp;&ldquo;Journalists would no doubt be concerned if the police sought to criminalize conversations between off-record sources and reporters,&rdquo; the newspaper said.        

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Also on Wednesday, a former reporter at&nbsp;The London Evening Standard, was arrested in the phone hacking case. The journalist, Raoul Simons, who had more recently worked at The Times, another Murdoch newspaper, was later released. He was the 16th person with links to the Murdoch papers to have been arrested in the case.
