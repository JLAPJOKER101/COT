And were off! Even though the Nokia Lumia 900 launched yesterday and was largely unavailable thanks to the Easter Bunny, the phone quickly skyrocketed to the top of Amazons best sellers list. The phone hovered around the 5th spot yesterday but jumped to the first and second spot today with the black version preferred over the cyan edition. This puts the Nokias large Windows Phone over top of Androids star players, the Droid RAZR MAXX and Galaxy Nexus.Part of the instant popularity likely comes from Amazons price of $50 with a two-year service plan. Thats $50 less than AT&Ts price and $150 less than the previously most popular phone from Amazon, the Droid RAZR MAXX.The other factor could be that for some reason AT&T and Nokia launched the phone in the US on Easter Sunday. Brian X. Chen of of the NYTs Bits blog found most NYC-based AT&T stores and resellers were understandably closed, making the phone rather difficult to find in person. Launching a pivotal phone on a Sunday is strange but launching it on a major national holiday is downright idiotic.Amazon has long been friendly to Windows Phone. Out of the top 100 best rated cell phones, the top three are slightly older Windows Phones with Verizons HTC Trophy occupying the top spot. Judging by the Lumia 900s current high rating, Nokias Windows Phone could soon join the rest of the family on that list as well.
