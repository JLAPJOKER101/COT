A Pakistani doctor who ran a vaccination program for the C.I.A. to help track down Osama bin Laden should be put on trial for high treason, a government commission said Thursday, a move likely to anger American officials pushing for his release. American and Pakistani officials have said that the doctor, Shakil Afridi, ran a vaccination program in Abbottabad, where Bin Laden was living, in an effort to obtain a DNA sample from him. Dr. Afridi was detained days after the American raid that killed Bin Laden by the Inter-Services Intelligence agency. The Pakistani commission investigating the raid said in a statement that that Dr. Afridi should be charged with &ldquo;conspiracy against the state of Pakistan and high treason&rdquo; on the basis of the evidence it had gathered. It was not clear whether the recommendation would lead to charges being filed. The charge would carry the death penalty.
