BUENOS AIRES &mdash; A former member of the Chilean secret police who was involved in killing a former Chilean army chief during that country&rsquo;s dictatorship was found stabbed to death in his apartment in Argentina, Argentine officials said Friday.        

Enrique Arancibia, 66, had been convicted of murder for the car-bomb killing of Carlos Prats, a retired general, and his wife in Buenos Aires in September 1974. General Prats, the former chief of the Chilean Army, had been an outspoken opponent of the Chilean dictator, Gen. Augusto Pinochet.        

The killings were part of Operation Condor, a secret operation by right-wing officials in seven South American countries in the 1970s and &rsquo;80s to eliminate political dissent.        

Mr. Arancibia had been a member of an ultraright terrorist group that had killed another Chilean Army chief, Gen. Rene Schneider, in Chile in 1970. After that killing, Mr. Arancibia fled to Argentina, where he later became Chile&rsquo;s liaison with the Argentine secret police.        

His body, with 10 to 12 stab wounds to his chest and back, was discovered by his partner late Thursday night, according to an Argentine official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.        

The Argentine police had not arrested any suspects by late Friday, and were investigating several leads, including robbery, a crime of passion or a disgruntled worker. Mr. Arancibia had been running a taxi business with four cars and four drivers.        

In 2000, he was sentenced to life in prison for the murder of the general and his wife, and to 12 years for the kidnapping and torture of two Chilean women who had been living in Argentina. Mr. Arancibia was freed on parole in 2007 for technical reasons and a calculation of time served, according to news reports.
