MANILA (AP) &mdash; A light airplane crashed into a school building on Saturday near here after its pilot requested an emergency landing shortly after takeoff. At least 13 people were killed, including two children.        

The plane burst into flames after hitting the school in Paranaque City, said the mayor, Florencio Bernabe. It is a suburb of Manila, the capital.        

No classes were in session when the plane hit, but officials were determining how many people on the ground were injured or killed, he said.        

Firefighters reported that the bodies were charred and that the dead included the pilot and the co-pilot, the only two people on the plane, Mayor Bernabe said.        

Dennis Sirilan, a senior inspector in the Police Department, said the fire spread rapidly to shanties that surrounded the school after the twin-engine plane crashed.        

Mr. Sirilan said he saw the aircraft &ldquo;twirling&rdquo; in the air before it slammed into the F. Serrano Elementary School, which was severely damaged by the fire.        

Firefighters were hampered by the narrow streets in the community and were unable to reach the scene quickly. The area was still smoldering after the fire was brought under control about three hours later.        

Gwen Pang, the secretary general of the Philippine Red Cross, said the dead included an infant and a child.        

She said at least 10 people were brought to a hospital, including five with major burns.        

Ram&oacute;n Guti&eacute;rrez, the chief of the civil aviation authority, said the small plane sent out a distress call shortly after taking off for Mindoro Island from Manila. The plane crashed before it was able to return to the airport.
