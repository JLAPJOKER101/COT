Gunmen killed seven Shiite Muslims in an attack on a minibus in northwestern Pakistan on Thursday, while two people died in a suicide car bomb attack on a police station. Militants in Pakistan frequently single out Shiites, whom they regard as non-Muslims, as well as Pakistan&rsquo;s pro-Western government. A government official said the gunmen ambushed the bus in an area of the Kurram tribal region. The suicide blast also took place in the northwest, but in a different region.
