Web-based productivity suite Zoho is revamping its CRM offering today. Zoho CRM is one of the companys most popular application with 25,000 customers. The most distinct differences between the new version and previous iteration is the UI. Zoho says that based on how customers were interacting with the app, workflow and screens were redesigned to streamline user interactions. Via a new Pulse module in the app, you can now follow a particular deal, contact or account in Zoho CRM. All activity related to what you are following will be shown in a stream of updated within the CRM application. Users can also filter activity based on who made the changes and where the changes are made. Zoho is also debuting a new LinkedIn integration, which allows users to pull information from LinkedIn about a contact, including  position, company, city and more. Users can also send direct LinkedIn messages to a contact without leaving the CRM application. Additionally, users can now use Zoho Creator to build custom apps that appear inside the CRM application and accesses data from the CRM system. While Zoho is still behind giants like Google and Microsoft in the productivity apps space, the bootstrapped company is still 5 million users strong, and includes nearly 30 apps in its suite of offerings.
