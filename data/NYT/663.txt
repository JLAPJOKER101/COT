At least nine people, including a United Nations staff member, have been killed in  clashes between southern and northern soldiers from a joint-integrated unit, officials said Friday. The fighting began Thursday evening after soldiers from a joint unit in Malakal were ordered to redeploy to the north, and a group of southern soldiers refused. &ldquo;The situation is still very dangerous,&rdquo; said Bartholomew Pakwan Abwol, a state government spokesman. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know how many have died.&rdquo;
