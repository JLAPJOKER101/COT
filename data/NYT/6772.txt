Gunmen killed two civilians in a northeast Nigeria city plagued by attacks from a radical Muslim sect, an official said Friday, while a hospital official said one more person died from Christmas attacks for which the sect was blamed, raising the toll to 42. Lt. Col. Hassan Ifijeh Mohammed, a military spokesman, said the latest attack occurred after Friday Prayer in a market near a mosque in the city of Maiduguri. A third person was wounded.
