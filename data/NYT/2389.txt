Nearly 70 people were killed in a cattle raiding conflict between rival tribes in Southern Sudan, officials said Monday. A Jonglei State official, Akot Maze, said the cattle raids happened near water points last week when Nuer tribesmen attacked, making off with more than 100,000 cattle owned by the Murle tribe. He said at least 68 people were killed.
