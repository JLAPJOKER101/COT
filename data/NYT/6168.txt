Britain is gearing up for its largest strike in more than 30 years, with as many as two million teachers, health-care workers, local government employees and border agents expected to walk off the job on Wednesday to protest a government plan that would require them to work longer and contribute more to their pensions. Some 90 percent of the country&rsquo;s schools are expected to close, local services will be severely curtailed, non-essential medical procedures face possible cancellation, and international passengers arriving at Heathrow Airport have been warned to expect delays of up to 12 hours in immigration halls. At least one airline, Etihad Airways, has already canceled flights; others are urging passengers not arrive on Wednesday and offering to let them change their reservations free of charge.
