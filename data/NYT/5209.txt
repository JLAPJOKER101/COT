The billionaire Aleksandr Y. Lebedev, left, is being investigated for throwing a punch at a fellow entrepreneur on a prime-time television talk show, prosecutors said Tuesday. In an online statement, Russian prosecutors said the case was opened after an initial investigation found that Mr. Lebedev had &ldquo;inflicted bodily harm&rdquo; on Sergei Polonsky, a developer and himself a former billionaire. Mr. Lebedev, who owns two British newspapers, The Independent and The Evening Standard of London, could face up to five years&rsquo; imprisonment if convicted.        

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Goaded by Mr. Polonsky&rsquo;s comment that he would rather hit someone than discuss financial matters with oligarchs, Mr. Lebedev sprang up and punched him in the face, sending him wheeling backward off the stage set. Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin characterized the clash as &ldquo;hooliganism.&rdquo;
