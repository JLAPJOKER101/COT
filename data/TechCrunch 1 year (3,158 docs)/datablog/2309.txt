The wait for the Galaxy Nexus is finally over in some parts of the world, but those of us in the States are still waiting for our turn with our noses pressed up against the glass. As if to torture us further, Google has not only released the domestic variants full spec sheet, but they have also uploaded a full series of Galaxy Nexus walkthrough videos.As far as the spec sheet goes, there isnt too much that we didnt already know. It does however confirm that the US-spec Galaxy Nexus has a slightly beefier battery than its international counterpart (1850mAh vs. 1750mAh). That extra juice comes at a price, and in this case it means Verizons Nexus is just a little chubbier than the one teased in Hong Kong. Luckily, the difference is a just over half a millimeter so only wearers of the tightest skinny jeans have cause to complain.So, with that spec sheet out in the wild, we know almost everything about the Galaxy Nexus except for its actual release date. In the meantime, feel free to make the wait even more excruciating by watching Googles walkthrough videos. There are quite a few out there, with topics ranging from using Beam to how not to break the battery plate. Interestingly, some of Droid-Lifes readers point out that Verizons Backup Assistant and My Verizon Mobile apps seem to be preloaded on the device. Its frankly a bit of a shock considering the Nexuss status as a pure Google phone, but Im guessing that little bit of promotion had Verizon putting their corporate checkbook through the wringer.Lastly, Googles thrown up what seems to be a new commercial for the Galaxy Nexus, entitled Calling All. Rather than dissecting the ad and debating its merits and shortcomings, Ill just leave it here for you to peek at. Personally, I think its a welcome change from the overbearing pomposity of Motorolas recent Droid RAZR ads, but well soon see if the softer approach works out.
