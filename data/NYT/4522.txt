After more than five months in jail, 12 suspects, including 2 prominent journalists, were formally charged Friday with supporting a terrorist network accused of plotting a coup, the semiofficial Anatolian news agency reported. The journalists, Nedim Sener and Ahmet Sik, both vocal critics of the governing Justice and Development Party who were also known for opposing a coup, were arrested in March without charges, because of prosecutors&rsquo; fears that they might flee. Media freedom advocates have protested the detentions, which they said were aimed at silencing government opponents, an allegation the governing party denied.
