Ireland&rsquo;s lawmakers on Wednesday accused the Vatican of encouraging Roman Catholic bishops not to tell the police about priests who were suspected of being pedophiles and of flouting Irish law. The rare denunciation of the Holy See&rsquo;s influence in this predominantly Catholic country came just a week after the government issued a report accusing the Vatican of sabotaging Irish bishops&rsquo; 1996 decision to begin reporting suspected cases of child abuse to the police.        

The report gave details of a confidential letter sent in 1997 by the Vatican&rsquo;s nuncio, or ambassador, in Ireland to Irish bishops, warning them that their child-protection policies violated canon law, which states that priests accused of abuse should be able to appeal their cases to the Vatican. &ldquo;This is not Rome. This is the Republic of Ireland 2011, a republic of laws,&rdquo; Prime Minister Enda Kenny, above, told lawmakers on Wednesday. He said the church&rsquo;s leaders had repeatedly sought to defend their institutions at the expense of children. It was the first time that Ireland&rsquo;s Parliament had criticized the Vatican, rather than local church leaders, over the 17 years of pedophile-priest scandals in Ireland.
