A series of explosions near the government headquarters in Ramadi, the capital of Anbar Province, killed 10 people, including seven police officers, on Thursday, local officials said. An additional 20 officers were wounded. Insurgents have carried out several attacks against the police and outposts of the central government in Ramadi in recent months, usually in response to the mass arrests of terrorism suspects.
