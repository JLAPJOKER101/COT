The death of the former Libyan leader, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, who was captured and killed by rebels in October, may have been a war crime, the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court said on Thursday. The chief prosecutor, Luis Moreno-Ocampo, said he thought that &ldquo;the way in which Mr. Qaddafi was killed creates suspicions&rdquo; of a war crime. Under pressure from Western allies, Libya&rsquo;s interim government has promised to investigate the former leader&rsquo;s death.
