MEXICO CITY (AP) &mdash; At least 28 people were killed in  attacks over the weekend along Mexico&rsquo;s border with Texas and on the Pacific Coast, the authorities said  Sunday.        

In Coahuila State, across the border from Texas, nine men died late Saturday when gunmen opened fire inside two bars in separate attacks, state prosecutors said in a statement. Eleven others were wounded.        

Five other men were killed the same night in a bar in Ciudad Ju&aacute;rez, which is across the Rio Grande from El Paso and is notorious for its drug cartels, said Arturo Sandoval, a spokesman for the Chihuahua State prosecutors&rsquo; office.        

In three of Mexico&rsquo;s Pacific Coast states, at least 14 more people were killed in drug-related violence.        

The police in Acapulco found the bodies of four men inside a trash container; all had been shot, and three of their  throats had been slit. The body of a fifth man was found along a highway, said prosecutors in Guerrero State, where Acapulco is located.        

In Nayarit State, soldiers killed four people who were believed to be drug traffickers, the Defense Department said in a statement.        

The soldiers were on patrol along a river in the town of Santiago when gunmen opened fire, the Defense Department said. After the shooting, the soldiers seized a car, 12 weapons, 12 grenades and radio communication equipment, it said.        

Meanwhile, in Michoac&aacute;n State, police officers found the bodies of five men in different areas of Morelia, the capital, state prosecutors said. All of the victims had been shot in the head.        

More than 35,000 people have been killed in drug-related violence since President Felipe Calder&oacute;n ordered a military offensive against the country&rsquo;s drug gangs shortly after taking office in December 2006.
