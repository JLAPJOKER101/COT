Andr&eacute;s Manuel L&oacute;pez Obrador announced on Tuesday that he would lead Mexico&rsquo;s leftist Party of the Democratic Revolution, or P.R.D., in the 2012 presidential election. Mr. L&oacute;pez Obrador beat Marcelo Ebrard, the mayor of Mexico City, in a poll of 6,000 people that the two men had agreed would determine which of them would be the party&rsquo;s candidate. Mr. Ebrard has agreed to throw his support behind Mr. L&oacute;pez Obrador, who lost to President Felipe Calder&oacute;n in 2006 by half a percentage point. Mr. Obrador never accepted that result, and his loss set off mass protests.
