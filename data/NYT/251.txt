Twelve drug cartel suspects and two soldiers were killed in a nearly six-hour gun battle in the Gulf Coast state of Veracruz, the authorities reported Friday. About 100 soldiers, marines and police officers surrounded a drug gang safe house in Xalapa late on Thursday, said Public Safety Secretary Sergio L&oacute;pez Esquer. The gunmen resisted, and a standoff ensued. Security forces stormed the house early Friday and seized grenades, ammunition and vehicles, Gen. Rene Aguilar Paez of the army said. There were no arrests.
