TREMBLOIS-L&Egrave;S-CARIGNAN, France &mdash; The municipal council here on the edge of the Ardennes Forest recently voted to change a third of the village&rsquo;s street names.        

Tremblois has only three streets, and they are named for three French heroes of World War I: Marshals Ferdinand Foch, Joseph Joffre and Philippe P&eacute;tain.        

The problem is that Marshal P&eacute;tain had a second act as head of state during World War II, when his administration in the unoccupied part of the country that was known as Vichy France collaborated with Nazi Germany in eliminating its enemies, notably the Jews.        

So under pressure from the national government, veterans and Jewish groups, the council voted unanimously to drop the name P&eacute;tain from a little street about 600 feet long, renaming it Rue de la Belle-Croix, for a chapel that stands in a wood at its foot.        

After World War I, virtually every town in France had its Rue or Avenue P&eacute;tain. So vast was his fame that a dozen or so towns and cities in the United States also named streets for him.        

But when the signs here change this month, the last street in France bearing his name will have disappeared. Not everyone is happy with the decision.        

&ldquo;It is ridiculous,&rdquo; said Laurent Joste, 27, an auto mechanic from Belgium who has lived in the village for three years. &ldquo;Clearly, he was a traitor in the Second World War; but these things happened decades ago. It&rsquo;s not good to think like that.&rdquo;        

World War I left deep scars in the village, which lies among the killing fields of 1914-18, near the Belgian border. It is a short drive from here to Verdun, where armies faced off for years in one of the war&rsquo;s most calamitous battles. It is hard by the Marne River and Chemin des Dames ridge, where the slaughter of French troops in 1917 incited mutinies that only the calm but firm hands of Marshals Foch and P&eacute;tain put down.        

Tremblois was leveled by shelling, save for a few houses and the church. A monument to the war dead &mdash; a statue of a French poilu, or doughboy, in bright colors &mdash; bears the names of 15 villagers, roughly 15 percent of the population then.        

By comparison, World War II left the village relatively untouched. For Jean Ponsart, who was 13 in 1945, the principal memory is of the endless column of American trucks and tanks rumbling along Rue Foch, the main street, stopping now and then, out of precaution, but usually long enough to give candy to the village children.        

His house bears the sole sign for Rue P&eacute;tain (street signs in France are often on the sides of houses), and he says he is comfortable with it. He opposed a proposal to rename the street Rue Charles de Gaulle, for the leader of the French resistance in World War II and postwar president. &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s P&eacute;tain or de Gaulle,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;then P&eacute;tain!&rdquo;        

The commotion around Rue P&eacute;tain began last year when a local journalist discovered the street and wrote several articles for his newspaper. At the time, two other towns in northern France had streets named for Marshal P&eacute;tain, and his portrait hung in the hall of a third town, in the west of France. Under public pressure, the other streets were renamed, and a court ordered the portrait taken down. Tremblois remained the marshal&rsquo;s last refuge.        

&ldquo;It was scandalous,&rdquo; said the journalist, Guillaume L&eacute;vy. &ldquo;I met the mayor. There were different reactions; the arguments were not political.&rdquo;        

First there was the enduring image of Marshal P&eacute;tain as the &ldquo;conqueror of Verdun,&rdquo; the man who won World War I for the French, Mr. L&eacute;vy said by telephone. Then there was also the inconvenience. &ldquo;I talked to the man on whose house the sign hangs,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He said how much it would cost, that the postman wouldn&rsquo;t know where to bring letters.&rdquo;        

&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it got all polemical.&rdquo;        

Partly, it was town versus country. The village mayor, Jean-Pol Oury, shows visitors the hate mail he got, including threats, for keeping the name P&eacute;tain. Mr. Oury, 56, who runs a public relations company when not steering the affairs of Tremblois, said he did a survey among its 114 residents. &ldquo;A majority said, &lsquo;It doesn&rsquo;t disturb me,&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; he said.        

Still, Mr. L&eacute;vy&rsquo;s articles caught the attention of Jewish groups and organizations representing the war&rsquo;s survivors and people who were deported during World War II by Petain&rsquo;s Vichy government and the Germans who occupied the rest of France. Finally Mr. Oury went before the town council&rsquo;s nine members. &ldquo;I explained the situation, that we were the last town with a P&eacute;tain street,&rdquo; he recounted. &ldquo;I said two other towns had just renamed streets. I said it&rsquo;s you who decide.&rdquo; All nine voted to change the name.        

Many historians consider Marshal P&eacute;tain as more of an enabler of the Nazis than an instigator of their designs. Although that view was tinted by the discovery last year of papers suggesting that he took an active role in writing the Vichy government&rsquo;s anti-Jewish laws.        

Historians have long blamed him for failing to desert the Nazis once their policies of extermination of the Jews became clear. He was sentenced to death in a postwar trial for treason, but President de Gaulle commuted the sentence to life imprisonment. In 1921, de Gaulle, a great admirer of P&eacute;tain, honored him by naming his first son Philippe.        

A remnant in France still defends Marshal P&eacute;tain. &ldquo;In 1940, since the government was incapable of acting in the face of chaos, the first who came among the people and the politicians was P&eacute;tain,&rdquo; said Hubert Massol, president of the Association for the Defense of the Memory of Marshal P&eacute;tain, which was founded right after the war by the marshal&rsquo;s closest supporters. &ldquo;Then all the mistakes were dumped on him.&rdquo; Without Petain&rsquo;s intervention, Mr. Massol said, &ldquo;no one, not even the Jews, would have been spared.&rdquo;        

In Tremblois, some are relieved to see the change, even if the name never bothered them. Marie Stutzmann, 46, moved from Alsace with her parents 40 years ago to a corner house on Rue P&eacute;tain. Friends and acquaintances invariably reacted when she told them her address. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t bother me,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But people raised their eyebrows.&rdquo;        

C&eacute;line Grulet, 41, who works in the big Ferrero chocolate factory just across the border in Belgium, said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m content that it&rsquo;s being changed. Particularly with regard to the years after 1940.&rdquo; For years she grated at the name. &ldquo;But I said to myself, &lsquo;What can I do?&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;        

Mayor Oury cites President Nicolas Sarkozy. &ldquo;Sarkozy often says, with regard to the Germans, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t forget, but forgive.&rsquo; Why not P&eacute;tain?&rdquo;
