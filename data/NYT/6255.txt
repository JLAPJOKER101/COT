The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant largely withstood the March 11 earthquake, but succumbed to the tsunami that followed, according to an internal study released Friday by the plant&rsquo;s operator, Tokyo Electric Power. The report concluded that there was no evidence to suggest that the main facilities at the site were compromised by the quake before the tsunami waves hit. The company has been eager to show that the site was relatively unscathed by the quake. A finding that the quake had caused the damage would heighten concerns about nuclear plants in other areas, where big quakes are far more frequent than tsunamis. A panel of experts that reviewed the study for the company said it had been unprepared for a tsunami of that scale, which slowed its response and made the disaster worse. The government is also conducting its own investigation.
