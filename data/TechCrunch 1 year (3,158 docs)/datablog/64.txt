If youve grown sick of these NBC/Olympics stories, too bad! We have nearly two weeks of Olympics and their respective tape delays left. I dont even want to count how many hours of delayed Ryan Seacrest that is.Here is a wild, EXCLUSIVE, Olympic story that could only be found by top-notch journalists with Internet connections and Twitter accounts (where could we find people with those qualifications? Not in New Orleans).Anyway, buried lede: A Twitter account, @NBCDelayed has been mocking NBCs ill-conceived, tape-delayed coverage of the 2012 Olympic Games. The account has only posted 29 tweets, but they are comedic gold; starting two days after the opening ceremonies, it has attracted over 26,000 followers in under four days.Here are some of my favorites:BREAKING: American colonists announce independence, King to respond.— NBC Delayed (@NBCDelayed) July 29, 2012Michael Jordan and Dream Team win gold medal in 117–85 victory against Croatia— NBC Delayed (@NBCDelayed) July 29, 2012Tune in tonight for the Olympic Opening Ceremonies in Beijing #NBCFail— NBC Delayed (@NBCDelayed) July 29, 2012BREAKING: Dewey defeats Truman in landslide.— NBC Delayed (@NBCDelayed) July 30, 2012CORRECTION: Dewey doesnt defeat Truman, Truman re-elected President.— NBC Delayed (@NBCDelayed) July 30, 2012BREAKING: Roman Emperor Theodosius bans Olympic Games, NBC delay to catch up shortly. #394AD— NBC Delayed (@NBCDelayed) July 30, 2012BREAKING: Underdog Jamaican bobsleigh team loses control and crashes.— NBC Delayed (@NBCDelayed) August 1, 2012Want more Olympics? Dont worry, we are now running a delayed version of our delayed broadcast.— NBC Delayed (@NBCDelayed) August 1, 2012I dont know about you, but I cant wait until Twitter tips off NBC, NBC files a complaint and Twitter suspends the account before re-activating it and apologizing. Man, wouldnt that be a crazy sequence of events?
