Zimbabwe&rsquo;s government has given foreign companies, including mine operators and banks, 14 days to submit &ldquo;acceptable&rdquo; plans on how they propose to transfer majority shares to local residents or risk losing permits, state media reported Friday. The companies include the platinum miners Zimplats, which is majority owned by Impala Platinum, and Mimosa, Implats&rsquo;s 50-50 joint venture with Aquarius Platinum. Others include Rio Tinto&rsquo;s Murowa diamond mine, British American Tobacco and local units of the British banks Standard Chartered and Barclays.
