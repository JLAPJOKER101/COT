The United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission said on Monday that its 24-hour operations center had stopped monitoring the nuclear reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi plant because the situation there had improved. &ldquo;The conditions at the Japanese reactors are slowly stabilizing,&rdquo; said William Borchardt, the agency&rsquo;s chief staff official. &ldquo;As conditions have continued to improve and the Japanese continue to implement their recovery plan, the N.R.C. has determined that it is time to adjust our response,&rdquo; he said. The agency still has a team of engineers in Tokyo, he said. Mr. Borchardt said last week that the condition of the reactors was &ldquo;static but not stable.&rdquo;
