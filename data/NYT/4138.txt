The prime minister of Poland dismissed more than a dozen top air force officers and Defense Ministry officials on Thursday after an Interior Ministry report on a devastating plane crash said that poor crew training, lax safety regulations and unprofessionalism were to blame.        

The April 2010 crash, at the Smolensk airport in Russia, killed the president of Poland, his wife and 94 other people, many of them top officials of the Polish government.        

The dismissals followed the departure of the defense minister, Bogdan Klich, who resigned immediately after the report was released last week. His deputy, Gen. Czeslaw Piatas, was one of the officials fired on Thursday.        

&ldquo;These are the first steps,&rdquo; the prime minister, Donald Tusk, said in announcing the dismissals at a news conference on Thursday. &ldquo;They will be difficult, but I believe the Polish military needs them.&rdquo; He did not say whether there would be further firings.        

The fired air force officers, including three generals, were responsible for pilot training.        

Tomasz Siemoniak, who replaced Mr. Klich as defense minister, said at the news conference that the air force unit responsible for transporting top officials, Special Regiment 36, was being disbanded. Mr. Tusk said that the national commercial airline, LOT, would take over responsibility for official flights from the military.        

Analysts said that Mr. Tusk was determined to assert control over the armed services.        

&ldquo;The military were told to introduce safety measures two years ago, after senior officers were killed in a crash, but they did not do it,&rdquo; said Eugeniusz Smolar, a senior fellow at the Polish Institute of International Relations in Warsaw. &ldquo;This is about the civilian side exerting authority over the military.&rdquo;
