A young Miami Beach arms dealer who admitted to defrauding the Pentagon in a munitions contract was sentenced on Monday to four years in federal prison, bringing a case that embarrassed the Pentagon closer to its end. The dealer, Efraim Diveroli, 25, was president of AEY Inc., a fledgling company that surprised industry insiders in 2007 when the United States Army awarded it a $300 million contract to supply ordnance to Afghan security forces. Mr. Diveroli pleaded guilty to plotting to ship prohibited Chinese ammunition to the war. Four men have been convicted in the scheme. Mr. Diveroli is awaiting sentencing for a separate charge of possessing a firearm while on bail.
