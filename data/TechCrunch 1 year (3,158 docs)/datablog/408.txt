Anthony Coombs is CEO of Interact and a passionate Philly tech booster who helped us gather a great group of people last week to our Mini Meet Up. I took him into a dark quiet corner to talk about his startup, the tech scene in Philly, and the burgeoning NJ/PA tech corridor.People asked us why we visited Philadelphia and the short answer is Anthony asked us to come. Once we got there, however, we found the best of multiple worlds  a large university community, cheap rents, and an group of people hungering for a turnaround. As the economy speeds up over the next few years it will be interesting to see just how the Boston-NYC-Philly-DC parallelogram begins to come into its own.When I started these mini meet-ups my state goal was to show that there was an entire country full of cool stuff east of San Francisco. I think these events are proving that thesis quite handily.
