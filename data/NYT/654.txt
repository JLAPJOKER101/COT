The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria announced steps on Friday to strengthen antifraud safeguards, including doubling the budget for internal investigations. The group acted after a Jan. 23 article by The Associated Press described corruption in grants to Mali, Mauritania, Zambia and Djibouti. The fund said it was seeking to recover $34 million from those and other countries, an amount it said was less than 1 percent of the $13 billion in aid it has disbursed in 145 countries.
