I think the folk tale of employers asking to see a candidates Facebook account was apocryphal at best, but it seems like its even being debunked in HR circles. Andy Lester a blogger on high-tech career-hunting, has noted that the tale, which surfaced in an AP story a few weeks ago, has been picked up as an example of the horrible state of hiring in this country. Pundits have opined, ink has been spilled, and now interviewees are ready to go into future places of work full of righteous indignation, just waiting for the mention of Facebook. But for the most part its an urban legend.First, most social media accounts are an open book in the first place. I suspect potential recruiters pop over to Google to look up potential hires and I expect the reverse is true. The idea that a recruiter is interested in seeing you drunk at a party is far-fetched (unless youre working at a place that you probably wouldnt want to work at anyway) and a healthy social media presence isnt much of a hindrance anymore.Lester writes:
