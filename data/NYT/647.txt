A Chinese official, Xu Zhitao, has denied accusations by Indian officials that a revered Tibetan leader living in India is a spy for the Chinese government, Chinese news reports said this week. Indian officials first accused the Tibetan, the 17th Karmapa Lama, left, of being a spy after Indian police officers seized $1.5 million worth of foreign currency, including Chinese renminbi, last month from the lama&rsquo;s home in Dharamsala. There is a dispute over the Karmapa Lama; a rival candidate who has close ties to Indian intelligence officials claims he is the true lama. Tibetan Buddhism&rsquo;s spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, backs the one in Dharamsala,  seen by many Tibetans as a possible future leader.
