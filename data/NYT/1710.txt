Militants ambushed a convoy of Pakistani troops near the Afghan border on Monday, killing 11 of them, a government official said. The dead included a colonel and a captain in the Frontier Corps, a paramilitary unit that is being trained by American Special Forces soldiers. A government official in the Khyber tribal agency said the convoy was returning from a mission when it was attacked near Peshawar.
