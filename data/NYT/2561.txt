Two Tibetan monks from a restive monastery have been sentenced to three years in prison during a two-month crackdown in Sichuan Province, and about 300 monks taken away in April from the same monastery are still in detention, according to a report by the International Campaign for Tibet, an advocacy group based outside China. The two monks, both from the Kirti Monastery, are Losang Dargye, 31, and Konchok Tsultrim, 33; they were arrested separately in the last two months, the group said. Chinese security forces began surrounding Kirti Monastery in March, when a young monk, Phuntsog, died after setting himself on fire to protest Chinese policies. Local officers have declined to comment.
