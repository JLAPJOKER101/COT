The president of the party that ruled Mexico for seven decades resigned Friday in the face of a financial scandal that threatened to taint the party&rsquo;s prospects for reclaiming the presidency next year. Humberto Moreira stepped down from his post at the Institutional Revolutionary Party, saying news media coverage connecting him to a large debt and loan irregularities in his home state, Coahuila, which he governed until January, were hurting the party. The party&rsquo;s candidate, Enrique Pe&ntilde;a Nieto, is the front-runner in most presidential polls, and it is striving to convince voters that it has moved past a history of corruption.
