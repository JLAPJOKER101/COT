Google just announced the major refresh of Google TV. It adds a bunch of new features to the platform including Android Market and a TV & Movies. Im not entirely sure this new coat of paint will help sell the house per se, but it will certainly make the current owners happy.The update will slowly hit existing Google TV units starting with the Sony models on Sunday with the Logitech boxes getting it shortly thereafter. As with most mass roll outs, you might be waiting in line awhile until a spot opens on the server. Thankfully Google released these demo videos that show off a bunch of the new features to pass the time.
