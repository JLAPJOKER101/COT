Samsung isnt the first company to break into the phablet space, but those of you waiting for a (more than) worthy successor to devices like the Dell Streak 5 wont have much longer to wait. AT&T has just announced that their pocket-busting Galaxy Note will be hitting their sales channels on February 19, complete with a $300 price tag.Most of the devices details  5.3-inch HD Super AMOLED display, LTE radio, and handwriting support thanks to the included S-Pen  were revealed or reiterated at this years CES, but now the question is whether or not people will take the plunge on a device thats not quite a phone and not quite a tablet.AT&T hasnt exactly priced the Galaxy Note to move, but theyre not alone on that front. Weve seen Verizon adopt the $300 price tag for most of their recent high-end smartphone releases, though AT&T has typically shied away from pricing their smartphones so steeply. Theyre probably hoping that the novelty of a device that hovers somewhere between being phone and a tablet will be enticing enough to justify the price, but well soon see how the public at large takes to Samsungs fabulous phablet.If youre the type who likes getting things before everyone else (and really, who isnt?), you may want to wake up bright and early on the February 5th. AT&T is pushing their pre-order process with the promise of a Galaxy Note in your hands a full two days before it makes its way to store shelves, and I can imagine more than few phablet fans using that 48-hour window to rub their new purchase in other peoples faces.
