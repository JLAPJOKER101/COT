Well weve run a lot of TechCrunch meetups all over Europe since 2007, getting to most of the major European cities. But theres one place we havent got a chance to hit and thats the tiger economies of the Baltic states: Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. The latter is of course where, famously, Skype was largely developed. So were putting that right with an event in January, TechCrunch Baltics. It will be on February 9th, 2012, in the lovely city of Riga, Latvia. Tickets will be available soon but please sign up on the site and follow @TCBaltics for information.
