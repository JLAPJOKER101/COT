A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said Tuesday that human rights monitors at the United Nations should respect China&rsquo;s sovereignty, in effect rebuffing a demand that a prominent dissident lawyer, Gao Zhisheng, be released immediately from secret detention. The demand, which was made in a letter to the government in July, was made public on Monday. The spokeswoman, Jiang Yu, said at a regularly scheduled news conference in Beijing that she did not know the specifics of Mr. Gao&rsquo;s case. &ldquo;We attach importance to cooperation with the U.N. human rights&rsquo; monitoring mechanism and urge the mechanism to respect China&rsquo;s judicial sovereignty,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;China is a country under the rule of law.&rdquo; Mr. Gao, missing for almost one year, had said earlier that he had been tortured in the past.
