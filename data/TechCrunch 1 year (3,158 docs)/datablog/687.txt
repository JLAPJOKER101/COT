The round was led by Samsung Ventures and also included Translink Capital.YuMe founder Jayant Kadambi confirmed the raise, and told me by email that the funding will be used primarily to expand into more connected devices. YuMe provides a platform for delivering ads against online videos, but has recently been adding support for connected TVs.[W]e are using to expand our Connected TV business across OEMs and publishers globally.
