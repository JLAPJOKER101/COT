The reputed leader of one of Mexico&rsquo;s most violent drug cartels was extradited to the United States on Friday to face drug-trafficking charges, the Mexican attorney general&rsquo;s office said. The suspect, Benjamin Arellano F&eacute;lix, who is believed to have led the Tijuana drug cartel from the 1980s until his arrest in 2002, is one of the highest-profile drug suspects to be extradited under the administration of President Felipe Calder&oacute;n. He was handed over to United States marshals at an airport on the outskirts of Mexico City, the attorney general&rsquo;s office said.
