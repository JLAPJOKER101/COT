As everyone is well aware by now, a key part of every social network is gaming. Even when Google+ launched amid fanfare this summer, everyone quickly wondered: where are the games? And they quickly came. Now Tagged, the social network that few people seem to talk about (but is still alive and well) has made a purchase to bolster their own gaming prowess: WeGame.Terms are not being disclosed, and its not yet clear how the two services intend to work together (if at all). But again, social + gaming, its a key matchup. WeGame will remain open for now while the team begins work on new projects and integrations on Tagged. The plan is to talk about how Tagged will use WeGames technology in thecomingmonths.The WeGame deal is also the secondacquisitionthat Tagged has made in the past five months. Back in April, they bought the IM client Digsby.Tagged has over 100 million users. WeGame, which only has four employees, seems most excited about reaching that audience. And theyll be working under a company that has somehow managed to survive and even thrive in the social networking space in the age of Facebook. Of course, pivots help make that possible.WeGame had raised $3.5 million from True Ventures, The Hit Forge, SoftTech VC, Felicis Ventures, and others.
