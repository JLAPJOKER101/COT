AMSTERDAM (Reuters) &mdash; The Dutch government said Friday that it would ban face-covering veils worn by some Muslim women because the garments flout the Dutch way of life and culture.        

Prime Minister Mark Rutte also announced tougher rules for immigrants and asylum-seekers who want to pursue Dutch nationality; in the future, he said, they will have to show that they have income and that they have not received financial assistance or benefits for at least three years.        

The country&rsquo;s reputation as relatively tolerant and open to immigration has changed over the last decade, reflecting voters&rsquo; concerns over a large influx of Muslim immigrants.        

&ldquo;The government believes the wearing of clothing that completely or almost entirely covers the face is fundamentally at odds with public life, where people are recognized by their faces,&rdquo; the government said in a statement.        

The new measures reflect the influence wielded by Geert Wilders, a populist politician whose anti-Islam, anti-immigration Freedom Party is the third-largest in the Dutch Parliament.        

The government contended that the ban on face-covering veils did not represent a restriction on religious freedom, but that even if it was, it was &ldquo;necessary and justified in the interest of protecting the character and way of life in the Netherlands.&rdquo;        

Niqabs, which leave the eyes uncovered, and burqas, which cover the face with a cloth grid, are far less commonly seen on the streets of the Netherlands than hijabs, or head scarves, which leave the face exposed.
