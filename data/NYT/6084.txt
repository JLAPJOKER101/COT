A court in Tajikistan on Tuesday released two men &mdash; a Russian and an Estonian &mdash; whose prosecution had led to a confrontation with Moscow. The men, Vladimir Sadovnichy and Aleksei Rudenko, are pilots who landed at an airport in Tajikistan for emergency refueling in mid-March, although air traffic controllers had denied them permission to land. On Nov. 8, a court sentenced them to eight and a half years in prison. The case infuriated Russian officials, and last week Russia&rsquo;s Federal Migration Service began rounding up ethnic Tajik migrant workers in Moscow. On Tuesday, the Russian Foreign Ministry said it was &ldquo;satisfied&rdquo; by the men&rsquo;s release.
