Weve been covering Viber since the very beginning, through the launch of an Android app and the addition of photo/location sharing capabilities, to the moment the company announced 50 million users, 150 million calls, and a billion text messages per month. In fact, those milestones only sprung up a few weeks ago in February, and even more achievements are already being announced today. Between February and now, Viber has already jumped from 50 million users to 70 million users, who just so happen to talk for more than a billion minutes and send over a billion text messages per month. Daily, those numbers translate to over 7 million calls and 40 million texts, within which location sharing is being used about 10 percent of the time. With growth like that, the migration onto new platforms only makes sense, which is why the company has announced versions of its highly popular VoIP/messaging app for BlackBerry and Windows Phone. The app will launch in beta on both platforms. Viber for BlackBerry Beta and Viber for Windows Phone 7 Beta will come with Viber messaging, letting people share photos, text, and their location with other Viber users. Theres no friend requesting whatsoever  if theyre on Viber, the app will know and let you message them. Once Viber feels comfortable about the messaging capabilities on these beta apps, it will launch full versions of the Viber app (voice calls included) for both platforms. Turns out Robin hit the nail on the head with this prediction: My educated guess is that this will become a stunningly big hit in no time.This slideshow requires JavaScript.
