Israeli union officials threatened Wednesday to call a general strike to protest recent price increases that have sent the cost of gasoline, water and basic foods spiraling upward. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is expected to announce measures to ease the burden on the public on Thursday. A news conference was originally planned for Wednesday but was postponed after Finance Minister Yuval Steinitz was hospitalized, suffering from flu and exhaustion. Mr. Netanyahu is facing growing public anger over the increases: the cost of gasoline has gone up by 13 percent, the price of water has increased by more than 100 percent and many basic food items have risen by up to 8 percent over the past year.
