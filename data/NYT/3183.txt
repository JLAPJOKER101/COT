A military court on Monday postponed a hearing in the trial of 20 doctors seized during crackdowns on antigovernment demonstrators after their lawyers complained that they had been tortured in custody. The doctors, who were among dozens of medical workers rounded up in March, face charges ranging from stealing medicine to stockpiling weapons to taking over a hospital. They pleaded not guilty on Monday. A second part of the hearing was deferred after lawyers challenged the court&rsquo;s jurisdiction and requested that their clients undergo independent medical examination. A lawyer said the doctors had been tortured, forced to confess and denied access to counsel during initial hearings. Bahraini officials deny allegations of systematic torture of detainees and say that any instances of abuse will be investigated and prosecuted.
