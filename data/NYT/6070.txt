Danielle Mitterrand, the widow of former President Fran&ccedil;ois Mitterrand of France, who pushed beyond stereotypical notions of a first lady to champion leftist causes, once kissing Fidel Castro on the steps of the &Eacute;lys&eacute;e Palace, died on Tuesday in Paris. She was 87.        

President Nicolas Sarkozy of France announced the death. Mrs. Mitterrand entered a hospital on Friday with respiratory problems and was put in an induced coma on Sunday, French news reports said.        

When Mr. Mitterrand, a Socialist, became president in 1981, Mrs. Mitterrand made it clear that she had no enthusiasm for the traditional first-lady roles of hostess, decorator and good-will ambassador. During her husband&rsquo;s 14-year incumbency, the longest of any French president, Mrs. Mitterrand spoke up for ethnic Kurds, criticized President Ronald Reagan&rsquo;s Central American policies and started a foundation to promote human rights.        

After his presidency she continued to press her concerns, including drinking-water shortages in developing countries.        

&ldquo;I have no power,&rdquo; she said in an interview with The Washington Post in 1989. &ldquo;I have only my power of indignation, my power of conviction.&rdquo;        

She also had the ear of the most powerful politician in France. &ldquo;Fran&ccedil;ois would tell the complainers: &lsquo;Her causes are just, I can&rsquo;t stop defending them,&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; she told Le Journal du Dimanche, a French weekly newspaper, in October.        

Mrs. Mitterrand was regarded as more leftist than her husband, who was elected leader of the Socialist Party in 1971 and invited Communists into his government in 1981. Catherine Nay, in her 1984 biography, &ldquo;The Black and the Red: Fran&ccedil;ois Mitterrand, the Story of an Ambition,&rdquo; quoted him as saying in 1972, &ldquo;She considers me much too moderate in my political life.&rdquo;        

It was she who invited Mr. Castro to Paris in 1995; her husband&rsquo;s government emphasized that it was not a state visit.        

Mrs. Mitterrand made a large international impression at her husband&rsquo;s funeral in 1996. At the grave site, along with two of her sons with Mr. Mitterrand, she stood near his longtime mistress, Anne Pingeot, a museum curator, and his long-secret daughter with Ms. Pingeot, Mazarine Pingeot. She was photographed consoling the daughter. &ldquo;It was instinct,&rdquo; Mrs. Mitterrand said.        

In her 1996 memoir, &ldquo;En Toute Libert&eacute;&rdquo; (&ldquo;In All Liberty&rdquo;), she wrote that she had known about the daughter since her birth in 1974. Mr. Mitterrand, she said, &ldquo;excelled in the art of seducing.&rdquo;        

&ldquo;I had to make the best of it,&rdquo; she wrote.        

She more than forgave him; she defended him, saying his puritanical critics exhibited &ldquo;this hypocrisy of conformity.&rdquo;        

Danielle Gouze was born on Oct. 29, 1924, in Verdun in eastern France, site of the horrific World War I battle. During World War II her father lost his job as a school principal after refusing to identify Jews in the school, as ordered by France&rsquo;s Vichy government, which collaborated with the occupying Nazis. She joined the underground resistance as a nurse at 17 in Burgundy and won the Medal of Resistance.        

The story goes that Mr. Mitterrand, also a resistance fighter, first saw Danielle in a photograph at her sister&rsquo;s home. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s quite ravishing,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll marry her.&rdquo;        

They married on her 20th birthday. The war accelerated their courtship. &ldquo;When death hovers above you, your feelings multiply quickly,&rdquo; she recalled in Franz-Oliver Geisbert&rsquo;s authorized biography, &ldquo;Fran&ccedil;ois Mitterrand.&rdquo;        

Mrs. Mitterrand, a petite brunette with striking eyes, characterized her appearance as &ldquo;simple.&rdquo; Unlike her predecessors, she did not frequent the haute couture. As a hobby she became an accomplished bookbinder.        

She is survived by her sons Gilbert and Jean-Christophe. Her son Pascal died very young.        

Mrs. Mitterrand&rsquo;s political involvement accelerated after her husband left office in 1995. She campaigned for the release of Mumia Abu-Jamal, a former Black Panther who has been on death row in the killing of a white police officer in Philadelphia. In 2005, she urged a &ldquo;no&rdquo; vote in the French referendum on a European Union constitution, saying it valued the economy more than people. It was soundly rejected.        

In a message on the Web site of her foundation, France Fondation Danielle Mitterrand, she explained why she never lost her strong public voice. &ldquo;After a certain age,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;people go to sleep. As for me, I have no intention of dying by inches.&rdquo;
