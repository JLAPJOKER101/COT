The Hamas police in Gaza detained a Palestinian protester and two Palestinian cameramen on Thursday while breaking up a rally calling for political reconciliation. About 40 activists had gathered in front of a United Nations school, waving flags and chanting slogans for unity between the rival Hamas and Fatah factions.
