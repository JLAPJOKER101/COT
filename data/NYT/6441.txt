A Saudi woman was beheaded Monday after being convicted of practicing sorcery, which is banned, the interior ministry said. The woman, Amina bint Abdulhalim Nassar, was executed in the northern province of Jawf for &ldquo;practicing witchcraft and sorcery,&rdquo; the ministry said in a statement carried by SPA state news agency. The statement did not specify what acts she was accused of committing, but Philip Luther, the interim director of the Middle East and North Africa for Amnesty International, said, &ldquo;The charge of sorcery has often been used in Saudi Arabia to punish people, generally after unfair trials, for exercising their right to freedom of speech or religion.&rdquo; Amnesty condemned the execution, which it said was the 73rd in the kingdom this year.
