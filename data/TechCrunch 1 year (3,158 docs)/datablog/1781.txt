The engine of Googles business is search advertising, but its display advertising business is becoming a very large business. During todays earnings call, CEO Larry Page that Googles display advertising business is at an annualized run rate of $5 billion. That doesnt mean that $5 billion of Googles $38 billion in revenues in 2011 came from display advertising. It means that if you annualize the display advertising revenues in the fourth quarter, you would get $5 billion.When you back it out, that implies that Googles display advertising revenues in the fourth quarter was $1.25 billion ($5 billion divided by 4). To put that in perspective, total revenues for the quarter was $10.6 billion. So  about 12 percent of Googles revenues now comes from display advertising instead of search.How fast is display growing for Google? In the third quarter of 2010, or five quarters ago, it reported a $2.5 billion run rate for display ad revenues. So it doubled in a little more than a year.These display ad revenues include YouTube, mobile, and graphical display ads. Everything else is text search ads.
