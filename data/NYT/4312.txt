Sacks of grain, peanut butter snacks and other food staples meant for starving Somalis are being stolen and sold in markets, raising concerns that thieving businessmen are undermining international famine relief efforts. The United Nations World Food Program has acknowledged for the first time that it has been investigating food theft in Somalia for two months. The program strongly condemned any diversion of &ldquo;even the smallest amount of food from starving and vulnerable Somalis.&rdquo; A Somali government spokesman, Abdirahman Omar Osman, said that the government did not believe food aid was being stolen on a large scale, but that if such reports come to light, it would &ldquo;do everything in our power&rdquo; to bring action in a military court.
