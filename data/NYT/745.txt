TEHRAN &mdash; Iran&rsquo;s chief prosecutor on Wednesday called an opposition request to hold a rally in support of the uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt &ldquo;divisive&rdquo; and &ldquo;political.&rdquo; His comments suggested that officials would not grant permission for the rally, planned for Monday.        

&ldquo;If anyone really wants to support the people of Tunisia and Egypt, they should join the regime and the people and take part in the rally on Feb. 11,&rdquo; the semiofficial news agency ILNA quoted the prosecutor, Gholam Hossein Mohseni-Ejehi, as saying. Feb. 11 is the date of the annual government-sponsored rally celebrating the Islamic revolution of 1979.        

&ldquo;Setting a different date means that these individuals are separating themselves from the people and creating divisions,&rdquo; Mr. Mohseni-Ejehi said, apparently referring to the leaders of Iran&rsquo;s Green opposition movement, Mir Hussein Moussavi and Mehdi Karroubi. They issued an open letter to the Interior Ministry on Saturday, invoking a provision in Iran&rsquo;s Constitution granting the right to peaceful assembly.        

Since claiming election fraud after the victory of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in the 2009 presidential election, Mr. Karroubi, a former Parliament speaker and Mr. Moussavi, a former prime minister, have been labeled by Iran&rsquo;s hard-liners as leaders of a &ldquo;conspiracy&rdquo; to overthrow the Islamic Republic and usher in the influence of Western powers.        

Iran&rsquo;s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and other conservative figures have portrayed the uprisings in Egypt and Tunisia as a result of the people&rsquo;s &ldquo;Islamic awakening.&rdquo; Ayatollah Khamenei praised the protesters last Friday, prompting some members of the Iranian opposition to say a refusal to grant permission for their rally would be hypocritical.
