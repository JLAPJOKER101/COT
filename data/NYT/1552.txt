Israeli warplanes struck the Gaza Strip late Monday, in response to a barrage of mortar shells and missiles fired by Hamas militants at Israel two days earlier. Israeli F-16s carried out at least eight airstrikes, hitting a Hamas training camp, a brick factory, a metal workshop and a mechanic&rsquo;s garage, according to residents. Local reports said that at least five people, including a woman and two children, sustained moderate injuries. With attacks over the weekend, Hamas ended a cease-fire that had lasted since an Israeli military operation in Gaza ended more than two years ago. Hamas said the attacks were in response to &ldquo;ongoing Israeli crimes.&rdquo; However, there were signs of internal differences within Hamas, particularly between the hard-line military wing and the government, which may have led to the escalation.
