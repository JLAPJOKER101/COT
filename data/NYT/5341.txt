The worst floods in more than 50 years threaten to overwhelm barriers protecting Bangkok, and residents should be prepared for the danger, said Deputy Prime Minister Kittiratt Na-Ranong, who called it a crisis. Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra has urged officials to complete work on three flood barriers and five more canals to drain water from the capital before high tides peak on Monday. Officials are also shoring up flood walls, preparing evacuation plans and readying medical supplies, city officials said.
