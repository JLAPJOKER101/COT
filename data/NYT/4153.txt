In a report presented to Parliament on Friday, auditors criticized India&rsquo;s preparations and conduct of the Commonwealth Games last year as deeply flawed, riddled with favoritism and vastly more expensive than planned. The games were troubled by construction delays, cost overruns and accusations of corruption. The head of the organizing committee, Suresh Kalmadi, is in jail on corruption charges. The report, by the comptroller and auditor general of India, questioned Mr. Kalmadi&rsquo;s appointment on a recommendation by the prime minister&rsquo;s office over objections from the sports minister. The report also said there were serious irregularities with bidding and contracts. A parliamentary committee will decide whether to pursue criminal prosecutions.
