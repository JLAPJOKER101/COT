President Felipe Calder&oacute;n of Mexico accused the United States on Thursday of dumping criminals at the border because it was cheaper than prosecuting them. He said the practice had fueled violence in Mexico&rsquo;s border areas. United States officials reported a record number of deportations in fiscal year 2011, and said that the number of deportees with criminal convictions had nearly doubled since 2008. Among those deported, Mr. Calder&oacute;n said at an immigration conference, &ldquo;there are many who really are criminals, who have committed some crime and it is simply cheaper to leave them on the Mexican side of the border than to prosecute them.&rdquo;
