The presidential candidate Winston Tubman said Monday that he could still withdraw from next week&rsquo;s runoff elections even after his demand for the resignation of the head of elections was met. &ldquo;When it happened, we felt that we had made a gain but we didn&rsquo;t think that was all,&rdquo; Mr. Tubman said by phone. &ldquo;We need to make some administrative arrangements to allow us to observe the process more closely.&rdquo; His party, the Congress for Democratic Change, had said it would boycott the elections after claiming the first round of voting was fraudulent. Mr. Tubman came in second, but President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf did not win the majority needed to avoid a runoff.
