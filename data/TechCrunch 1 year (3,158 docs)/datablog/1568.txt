Revenue for that group of countries last year was $22 billion. Were only on the surface.Cook explained that the iPod didnt take off as quickly in the developing world because people were already getting music from their phones. But the world changed for us with iPhone. It introduced our brand to people who had never met Apple before.The iPhone is creating a halo for the Macintosh, and for iPads. We see the synergistic effects of the markets not only in the developed markets, but in the emerging markets. Next, Apple will focus on Brazil, Russia, and China, where Cook said Apples sales were $13 billion last year. Cook also mentioned his belief that the tablet market will soon surpass the PC market. Regarding the iPad, 55 million units shipped is something no one would have guessed. It took us 22 years to sell 55 million Macs, it took 5 years to sell 55 million iPods, 3 years to sell that many iPhones. Its on a trajectory thats off the charts.
