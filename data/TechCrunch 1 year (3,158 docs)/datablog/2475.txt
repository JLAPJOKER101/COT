This. Is. Disturbing. We are the co-founders of Gulu.com, and we want you to hang out.Gulu wants to fill the gap between services like Facebook Events/Plancast and those like Foursquare. Where the former let you plan far ahead and Foursquare lets you broadcast where youre at when youre there, Gulu focuses on spur-of-the-moment event planning with what they call intention broadcasting.The idea is pretty simple: you say what you want to do, and your friends tap the button that reads Me too!. All willing/hopeful participants are automatically wrangled up into a chat group, allowing the event to be planned on the fly.And if none of your friends are up to do what you want to do right this second? All of your pending I want tos are added to a ToDo list, which your friends can peruse at their leisure. Once youve got a satisfactory number of attendees onboard, you can get your event underway.Is it a strikingly new idea? Eh, perhaps not â€” a Facebook status update may work just as well. Of course, you could say the same thing about most social planning services, so we look forward to watching how this one grows.
