Israel does not have enough bomb shelters in schools and public places and is ill prepared to protect its citizens in case of war, according to an annual report issued by the state comptroller. The report said the country has not learned from the 2006 war with Hezbollah in Lebanon, when dozens of Israeli civilians were killed by Hezbollah rockets. It blames the military and the Interior Ministry, among other official agencies, for &ldquo;serious lapses&rdquo; in wartime readiness and says some are not investing needed funds in preparedness plans.
