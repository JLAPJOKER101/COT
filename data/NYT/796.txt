President Asif Ali Zardari swore in a new, smaller group of cabinet ministers on Friday in what the government described as &ldquo;part of an austerity drive&rdquo; to cut expenditures. Most of the 22 ministers sworn in Friday were from the president&rsquo;s Pakistan Peoples Party. The previous cabinet, made up of more than 60 ministers, state ministers and advisers, resigned this week. Critics called the step window dressing and said it would not be enough to win the confidence of international donors and the International Monetary Fund, which have been urging wide-ranging reforms to shore up the faltering economy.
