Chinese authorities have arrested the owner of a kindergarten that operated a severely overcrowded bus that crashed, killing 19 children, state media said. The privately run school will be closed and a new public school will open at the same location, the Qingyang city government said. The bus, originally a nine-seat van, was carrying 62 children and two adults when it crashed with a truck in Gansu Province on Wednesday. The school&rsquo;s owner, Li Jungang, has been arrested on suspicion of causing traffic casualties, the prosecutor&rsquo;s office said on its Web site. The Qingyang city government said parents of each killed child would receive $68,000 in compensation.
