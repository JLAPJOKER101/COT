Movile has spent the last decade providing content to Latin American audiences primarily on feature phones through partnerships with mobile carriers. Now Movile, which is based in Brazil, is looking to target Latino audiences globally, including in the U.S. and Europe. Its doing that with an office in Mountain View, Calif., which expands its presence in the U.S., as well as through the launch of an HTML5-based video service called Zeewe TV.Zeewe TV is a Facebook application that will combine both short-form and long-form content aimed at the global Latino market. It already has rolled up content from a number of major content providers, including MTV, Nickelodeon, Azteca TV, Band, and Terra. That includes videos in Spanish, Portuguese, and English that highlights Latin American news and celebrities.The social video sharing service was built with social hooks in mind, enabling viewers to instantly share what theyre watching with friends on Facebook. It also uses Facebook connect to create personalized suggestions based on a users interests, whats trending, and what his or her friends are sharing.Due to the massive amount of content that is being made available online, sorting through it can be near impossible if you dont know what youre looking for. Thats why social discovery is becoming a big trend among a number of video providers. And if you can combine social discovery with an already targeted audience demographic, you can get really high levels of engagement.While Zeewe TV leverages Facebook integration for discovery and sharing, it isnt just built for viewing on the social network. In fact, the portal was designed for both PC and mobile viewing, leveraging HTML5 to let users watch videos on their iPads or mobile phones without having to install a native app. And by enabling second-screen integration, viewers can simultaneously watch videos while also browsing other content thats available.
