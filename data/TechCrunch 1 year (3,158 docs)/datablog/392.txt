Solum, a startup building tools for a more data-driven approach to agriculture, has raised $17 million in Series B funding.The round was led by Andreessen Horowitz, and partner John OFarrell will be joining the Solum board. The companys PR team sent me a copy of the blog post that OFarrell has written about the funding, where he reveals that his teams nickname for the startup was Software Eats Dirt. Solum isnt just a software company, but I guess OFarrell couldnt resist echoing his partner Marc Andreessens famous editorial on Why Software Is Eating The World. (And as you can see from my headline, I couldnt resist, either.) OFarrell says Solum presents another opportunity for a Silicon Valley company to transform an industry:Solum’s platform enables farmers to correlate nutrient measurements and fertilizer application to actual yields, in a constantly improving feedback loop. Over time, the result for farmers should be a virtuous circle of increasing crop yields driven by ever-smarter and environmentally sustainable use of fertilizer, water and other precious resources. In essence, Solum’s technology will provide the data to drive farmers’ new intelligent machines, and the software to manage their application on a large scale.The company has announced two measurement tools so far. Theres a lab kit that customers can take into the field to measure the nitrate in the soil. Solum also runs a laboratory in Ames, Iowa, where customers can send soil samples for multinutrient analysis. The data from both services is accessible via the Web.It looks like Andressen Horowitz isnt the only firm that thinks theres room for big disruption in agriculture: Farmeron, which offers a SaaS tool for livestock production, recently raised $1.4 million.Solum previously raised a $2.05 million Series A led by Khosla Ventures, which also participated in the new round. The companys three co-founders all received Ph.Ds in Applied Physical from Stanford.
