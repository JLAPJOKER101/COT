Peecho, a Dutch startup that enables anyone to sell professionally printed products from their website, mobile or desktop apps, has raised $750,000 in financing from Peak Capital and DHG Holding to boost development and marketing of its embeddable cloud print button service.Basically, their solution lets anyone sell digital content as physical products (think magazines, photo books, canvas prints and whatnot), by helping its customers hook into a network of professional print production facilities.Peecho takes a cut of every sale realized by its customers, which include companies like Hyves, KODAK, Efteling and Issuu.The company explains that it executes production orders on the merchantâ€™s behalf, but collects the payments from consumers. Hence, they make an average margin of 20 percent on every order, although they point out this depends on the type of product. Peecho says it plans to introduce paid monthly plans that include premium features in the future, along with prepaid wholesale credit in return for a discount.
