MOSCOW &mdash; Human Rights Watch announced on Tuesday that the government of Uzbekistan had decided to expel its employees from the country, a move the group said indicated a &ldquo;deepening human rights crisis&rdquo; in the authoritarian former Soviet republic.        

The Uzbek government gave no reason for the expulsion, though Human Rights Watch said in a statement that the decision had come after years of harassment by officials there.        

&ldquo;Well over a dozen human rights and political activists and independent journalists are in prison, torture and ill-treatment in the criminal justice system are systematic, and serious violations go unpunished,&rdquo; the group said.        

Human Rights Watch criticized recent moves by the United States and the European Union to improve relations with the Uzbek government and called on them to hold the Central Asian nation accountable for its human rights record.        

Uzbekistan provides a supply route for equipment going to Afghanistan.
