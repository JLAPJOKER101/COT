The Security Council took the formal step on Wednesday of referring the Palestinian request for full membership in the United Nations to the special committee that is to consider it, consisting of a diplomat from each of the 15 states on the Council. The first meeting is scheduled for Friday, with the ambassadors expected to represent their countries. The Palestinian envoy, Riyad Mansour, said the Israeli announcement of 1,100 new settlement houses on occupied territory was a challenge to the international community at a time when it was seeking renewed peace talks. Ron Prosor, the Israeli ambassador, said the new houses were part of Jerusalem, which will be included in future negotiations. Only direct talks, not solutions imposed from the outside, will achieve peace, Mr. Prosor added.
