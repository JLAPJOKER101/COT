A Rome court has sentenced a Catholic priest to 15 years and four months in prison for sexually abusing minors, in one of the rare cases in Italy in which a bishop was called to testify in civil court. The Rev. Ruggero Conti, from a parish in Rome, was found guilty on Thursday of abusing seven minors between 1998 and 2008, a lawyer for the priest said. The court also ordered Father Conti to pay 50,000 euros ($70,000) in damages to each victim. Father Conti was suspended from his duties as a parish priest in the outskirts of Rome soon after his arrest in 2008, but not from his clerical duties, said his lawyer, Patrizio Spinelli. He said his client would appeal the ruling.
