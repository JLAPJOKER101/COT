The chief prosecutor in Veracruz State resigned Friday, a day after 32 bodies were discovered in a residential neighborhood and less than three weeks after 35 bodies were dumped on a busy highway. The state prosecutor, Reynaldo Escobar P&eacute;rez, resigned for unspecified &ldquo;personal reasons,&rdquo; a spokeswoman said. The departure came as federal forces flooded Veracruz and arrested 20 suspects believed to be members of rival drug gangs. President Felipe Calder&oacute;n hailed the arrests on Twitter as a &ldquo;great blow&rdquo; to criminal gangs.
