A court in Belarus handed down a death sentence on Wednesday against two men who had been found guilty of setting off a bomb in a subway station in Minsk, the capital, in April, killing 15 people and wounding hundreds. Judge Aleksandr Fyodortsov said the defendants &ldquo;pose an exceptional danger to society, and an exceptional penalty should be applied to them.&rdquo; Belarus is the only country in Europe in which the death penalty remains legal. After the verdict was read, Lyubov Kovalyova, the mother of one of the defendants, tearfully told reporters that the case against her son had been fabricated.
