The subscription commerce market is heating up with Birch Box, Kiwi Crate, and others all offering various takes on the monthly box model. Today, 500startups company Love With Food is launching its subscription model, which offers a monthly box to users with tasty, gourmet samples of food.Hereâ€™s how it works. Through monthly sample boxes, which are $14 per month with free shipping, Love With Food includes 5 or more gourmet tasty bites. The model gives people a way to find and taste samples of new foods before they buy full-size orders. Along with each box, users will get deep discounts on the gourmet food, new recipes that include one or more of the samples, and the opportunity to earn points which can be used for free products.Once a box is purchased, Love With Food will donate a meal to the charity No Kid Hungry to help fight childhood hunger. So far, the startup has donated 4400 meals with the help of its community.Love With Food is similar in a lot of ways to Foodzie, which also offers a monthly box filled with various gourmet foods. While Foodzie focuses on mostly, handcrafted artisanal food products, LoveWithFood will partner with any gourmet food producer. Additionally, Love With Foods box comes in at a lower price point than Foodzies monthly box (which is $29.95 per month)
