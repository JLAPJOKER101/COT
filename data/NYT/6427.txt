Dominique de Villepin, the former prime minister who gained international renown for speaking out against the war in Iraq, has shaken up France&rsquo;s presidential campaign by announcing he will run as an independent. The announcement is likely to complicate life for both the Socialist candidate, Fran&ccedil;ois Hollande, and President Nicolas Sarkozy, the head of the conservative Union for a Popular Movement party that Mr. de Villepin served under. Mr. de Villepin could siphon votes from both candidates, but the move is seen primarily as a finger in the eye of Mr. Sarkozy, a bitter rival.
