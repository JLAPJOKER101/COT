CAIRO &mdash; Past a battered Fiat displaying T-shirts on its hood with the words &ldquo;I am free,&rdquo; and a little way from a vendor hawking roasted sweet potatoes wrapped in membership applications for the former ruling party, a sign hangs from a tent in Tahrir Square that says something about the pride, regret and hope of Egypt&rsquo;s revolution.        

&ldquo;Our mistake,&rdquo; it declares, &ldquo;is that we left the square.&rdquo;        

Eighteen days of protests here reached a climax on Feb. 11, a moment celebrated across the Arab world, when the crumbling government of President Hosni Mubarak finally gave way. Now, in a summer of discontent, thousands of protesters have returned to the square, and after midnight on Tuesday, as on many recent nights, they offered a rebuttal to the idea that a revolution is a moment.        

Egypt is a turbulent place these days, as is the Arab world it once led. Defiant, festive and messy scenes unfold at night in a square that is at once a place and an idea. Revolutions are about expectations, and everywhere in Egypt, it seems, expectations &mdash; about who should rule, how they should rule and who should decide the way they rule &mdash; have not been met.        

&ldquo;Sit-in! Sit-in!&rdquo; young men shouted. &ldquo;A sit-in until the regime is put on trial.&rdquo;        

&ldquo;We have a feeling the regime is still there, somehow,&rdquo; said Tarek Geddawy, 25, a musician, who returned to the square on Friday and has stayed since then. &ldquo;They sacrificed the icons of the regime, but the cornerstone is still there.&rdquo;        

From a cluster of tents, a song by an Egyptian icon of another age, Abdel-Halim Hafez, played from a loudspeaker, seeming to echo Mr. Geddawy&rsquo;s words.        

&ldquo;If the world falls asleep, I will keep my guard up,&rdquo; the song goes. &ldquo;My weapon in my hand, day and night awake, telling revolutionaries that our enemy can&rsquo;t be trusted.&rdquo;        

Even in its reincarnation, Tahrir Square has kept the ebullience of months past. Artists like Nour Ramadan painted Egyptian flags on tired faces, charging a dollar or so. Musicians like Cairokee took the stage, giving way at 1 a.m. to impromptu poetry, oud recitals, children&rsquo;s a cappella songs and Arabic rap that denounced American and Israeli policies in the same riff with calls for speedier trials of Mr. Mubarak and his men.        

But a unity of purpose has given way to a multiplicity of demands, mirroring the divides that trouble Egypt&rsquo;s political life these days. Debates rage over the timing of elections, the power of Islamists, the weakness of civilian rulers and the lack of accountability of their military counterparts, who suggested on Tuesday, in a seeming concession to protesters, that they would help protect civil liberties in the drafting of a new constitution.        

The iconic slogan &mdash; &ldquo;People want to topple the regime&rdquo; &mdash; has given rise to endless corollaries, even among the largely secular crowd here. In any gaggle of youths, &ldquo;the regime&rdquo; was replaced with Prime Minister Essam Sharaf; the military council; and the corruption that seems a synonym for decades of misrule.        

In the revolutionary fervor of February, Tahrir Square was a liberated enclave in an authoritarian country, an imagined community of sorts. Now it is Egypt itself, the distilled scene of all the fights and struggles, debates and fears that will decide its future.        

&ldquo;The revolution has informed people of the meaning of politics,&rdquo; said Abdel-Aziz Moussa, a 25-year-old dentist. &ldquo;We all know when we&rsquo;re being played now.&rdquo;        

In that, he captured a microcosm of the square today that stands as perhaps the revolution&rsquo;s most remarkable legacy. For so long, Arab leaders endured despite their relentless repression, colossal mismanagement or subservience to the West, because they managed to depoliticize their populations, often by force. But today, everyone in the square seemed to talk politics, with skepticism and critique.        

&ldquo;We changed, and they didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Ayman Abu Zeid, a 25-year-old doctor, said of the old government. He slept under tanks parked in Tahrir Square in February, blocking their way in case they tried to assault the protesters, and now he is in the square again. &ldquo;Nobody is going to go back home,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;No one.&rdquo;        

As a phrase, &ldquo;the Arab spring&rdquo; may never have captured what has unfolded this year. Libya is a civil war, Syria depressingly bloody. Bahrain was manipulated into a sectarian formula, and Yemen wrestled with the remarkable obstinacy of its leader. But it does suggest what the events meant for politics in nearly all those places, rejuvenating societies.

Under a large tent in the square, a collection of lean-tos bear the names of, by one activist&rsquo;s count, 42 different groups. There is the Tomorrow Party, Youth of Tahrir Square, the Egyptian Socialist Party, the Alliance of Revolutionary Forces, the Party of the Democratic Front and, somewhat poetically, the Movement of the Beginning.        

At 4 a.m., debates raged over a white loudspeaker: should protesters besiege the Mugamma, a behemoth of Egyptian bureaucracy in the square, or march on a building housing the cabinet? Youths warned one another of American and Saudi intentions to undermine the revolution. Others worried about the power of the Muslim Brotherhood, Egypt&rsquo;s largest Islamic group. One insisted that the military council should dissolve.        

&ldquo;If it does,&rdquo; another said angrily, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t ever cry again: &lsquo;Help us! Help us!&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;        

At dawn, Julia Milad, 33, a real estate agent, ambled past tents strewn with trash. The square has become as untidy as the politics, and in an arena filled with uncertain intentions &mdash; of the military, of a feared shadow state, of the Muslim Brotherhood &mdash; Ms. Milad insisted that the legitimacy that eluded occupiers and dictators, strongmen and monarchs for so long in Egypt now rested with the protesters. It is a point even the military council seems to acknowledge.        

&ldquo;We&rsquo;re the revolution, and revolutionary legitimacy is stronger than the power of the government, the power of the army, and the power of any other institution in society,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Revolutionary legitimacy is there in every square in Egypt.&rdquo;        

Long after the morning call to prayer on Tuesday, as streetlights switched off and clouds moved over the square, a couple in gown and tie joined protesters to celebrate their wedding. Nour Ramadan painted their faces, this time without charge. Protesters snapped shots with their cellphones. Others greeted the couple with boisterous chants. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go, everyone, to Tahrir,&rdquo; they cried. &ldquo;Tomorrow is the revolution of change.&rdquo;        

They passed displays of newspapers heralding the protesters&rsquo; anger at a prime minister they once claimed as their own.        

&ldquo;Tahrir Calls for Sharaf&rsquo;s Resignation,&rdquo; said one front page. &ldquo;Tahrir Square Rejects Sharaf&rsquo;s Speech,&rdquo; declared another. One celebrated &ldquo;the youth of the revolution,&rdquo; a phrase that may, like Tahrir Square, suggest foremost an idea.
