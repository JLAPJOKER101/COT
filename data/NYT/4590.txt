ISLAMABAD, Pakistan &mdash; At least 10 people were killed Wednesday in Quetta, in southwestern Pakistan, when an explosion struck a crowd in a parking lot near a Shiite mosque, police officials said.        

At least 20 people were wounded.        

There was no immediate claim of responsibility for what was believed to be a suicide car bombing, but sectarian attacks are frequent in the city, the capital of Baluchistan Province. A low-level insurgency by nationalists of the Baluch ethnic group has simmered in the province, and Taliban militants have found a haven there. Extremist Sunni groups like the Taliban have singled out Shiites and other religious minorities.        

&ldquo;The damage would have been more extensive had the terrorist managed to come closer to the mosque,&rdquo; a police official said.        

Local television news networks broadcast images of ambulances carrying the dead and wounded to hospitals, as distraught worshipers milled about. Plumes of smoke swirled in the debris-strewn street as vehicles burned. Remains of a badly mutilated body were found inside the wreckage of a car in the parking lot.        

Soon after the blast, Shiite protesters staged a rally at the site and chanted slogans against the government for failing to take more stringent security measures.        

In a statement released by the office of Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani, he condemned the bombing. &ldquo;Those elements playing with lives of innocent people would not escape the wrath of Allah and law of the land,&rdquo; he said.
