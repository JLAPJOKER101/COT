Residents from a town outside of Tripoli that had been accused on Libyan news broadcasts of supporting Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, who was captured and killed last month, rallied in the capital Monday to demand an apology for what they called slanderous reports. The protesters, from Warshefana, claimed that a television station supporting the transitional government, Libya al-Ahra, had falsely labeled them as pro-Qaddafi and incited gunmen from another town, Zawiyah, to take up arms against them. Fighting between gunmen from both towns has killed several men since last Thursday. The violence subsided by Monday, after mediation from the transitional government and elders. Many Libyans say Warshefana&rsquo;s population did include many people with pro-Qaddafi sentiments.
