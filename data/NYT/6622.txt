China will introduce stricter air pollution standards next year to monitor tiny particles of pollution in Beijing and other cities, but it may not start releasing the results to the public until 2016, state news media reported Thursday. Chinese cities do not measure data on the smaller particles, 2.5 microns in diameter or less, from smokestacks and exhaust pipes that shroud many cities in acrid smog, and many Chinese have complained that official statistics vastly understate the problem. Environment Minister Zhou Shengxian was quoted as saying in People&rsquo;s Daily that China would start measuring those particles, first in large cities and then nationally by 2015. Starting in 2016, cities will have to make the numbers public, the report said. Mr. Zhou said that the results should be publicized &ldquo;at an appropriate time.&rdquo;
