More than 100,000 Vietnamese have been killed or injured by land mines or other abandoned explosives since the Vietnam War ended nearly 40 years ago, and clearing all of the country will take decades more, officials said Monday. Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung said at a United Nations-sponsored conference that 42,132 people have been killed and 62,163 others wounded by land mines, bombs and other explosives since the war ended in 1975. The American ambassador, David Shear, told the conference that the United States had provided $62 million to help Vietnam clear the explosives. A Vietnamese official said that explosives remain in more than a fifth of the country.
