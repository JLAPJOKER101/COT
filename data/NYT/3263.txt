A Protestant church group sued former President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo on Thursday, claiming security forces under her control killed and tortured at least six of its members. Bishop Reuel N. O. Marigza, the secretary general of the United Church of Christ in the Philippines, said many of its pastors and church leaders were harassed, detained or tortured, and that five were executed. The suit does not accuse Mrs. Arroyo of personally ordering the abuses, but contends that she had &ldquo;command responsibility,&rdquo; Bishop Marigza said. Mrs. Arroyo&rsquo;s spokeswoman said she could not comment on the case before seeing a copy of the complaint.
