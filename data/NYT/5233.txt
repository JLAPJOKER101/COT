The head of the United States Agency for International Development said that famine relief efforts in the Horn of Africa have saved countless lives. Dr. Rajiv Shah, the agency&rsquo;s administrator, said in Nairobi on Wednesday that resources used in interventions to stop the famine spreading across the region have had an effect. The relief efforts, he said, have mitigated the slide from drought to famine &mdash; which has killed about 29,000 children in Somalia &mdash; in pastoral communities in Kenya and Ethiopia. Dr. Shah added that the United States had contributed more than $600 million to the efforts.
