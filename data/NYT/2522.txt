United Nations investigators in Ivory Coast have determined that there were at least 68 bodies in a mass grave recently discovered on a soccer field in Abidjan. Guillaume Ngefa, the deputy director of the human rights division of the United Nations mission in Ivory Coast, said Monday that the victims were probably killed by militias loyal to the strongman Laurent Gbagbo on April 12, the day after Mr. Gbagbo was arrested. The investigators interviewed witnesses and residents of the neighborhood where the killings occurred.
