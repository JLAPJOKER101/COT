JUBA, Sudan (AP) &mdash; Northern Sudanese troops appeared to have seized the contested town of Abyei on Saturday night, a United Nations spokeswoman said, increasing fears of conflict as the south prepares to become the world&rsquo;s newest country.        

Officials reported seeing 15 tanks belonging to the northern army in parts of the town, where mortars slammed against a United Nations base, said Hua Jiang, a deputy spokeswoman for the agency. One of those mortar rounds exploded, but there were no casualties among United Nations personnel, she said.        

The attack on the compound has prevented peacekeepers from patrolling, Ms. Jiang said.        

The violence came as a delegation from the Security Council arrived in Khartoum on Saturday, Bloomberg News reported. Southern Sudan will become independent on July 9, and the United Nations has expressed concerns about violence in the south and in several spots across the border region.        

Col. Philip Aguer, a spokesman for the South Sudanese Army, said Saturday that the north was bombing the area near Abyei from the air for a second day.        

The United Nations peacekeeping mission in Sudan issued a statement earlier Saturday calling for the immediate end of hostilities in Abyei and urging both sides to protect civilians in areas where there may be fighting.        

Southern Sudan&rsquo;s independence &mdash; approved overwhelmingly in a January vote &mdash; is less than two months away, but the status of Abyei has not been determined. Its future is the most important outstanding issue remaining to be settled.        

&ldquo;There are still air bombardments,&rdquo; Colonel Aguer said on Saturday, referring to the southern army&rsquo;s claims that the north began bombing Abyei on Friday after clashes there Thursday.        

Ms. Jiang said that artillery was heard in Abyei on Friday but that the United Nations could not verify more details because of insecurity in the area.
