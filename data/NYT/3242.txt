Senior American diplomats have returned to the Middle East on an unannounced visit to try to find ways of restarting the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks that collapsed last year and now face new challenges. The visit by Dennis B. Ross and David Hale, confirmed by Israeli and Palestinian officials on Wednesday, is their first to the region since President Obama&rsquo;s special Mideast envoy, George J. Mitchell, resigned last month after failing to break the negotiations deadlock.        

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;The first big challenge for the United States envoys is to find a formula for talks that would entice the Palestinians to drop their bid for unilateral recognition of a Palestinian state at the United Nations in September.        

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ldquo;There are talks going on to see if there&rsquo;s a formula that will allow for the restarting of the talks that would cause the Palestinians to abandon their unilateral approach,&rdquo; said an Israeli official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the visit was not announced publicly. The office of the Palestinian prime minister, Salam Fayyad, confirmed that he met with the American diplomats but did not release details. The diplomats also met Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel on Wednesday.
