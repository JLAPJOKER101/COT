President Demetris Christofias, left, faced calls to resign on Monday after an independent inquiry accused him of negligence over a munitions blast in July that killed 13 people and destroyed the main power station. A report by a state investigator said Mr. Christofias bore both institutional and personal responsibility for &ldquo;gross negligence&rdquo; for the explosion of confiscated Iranian munitions, which had been stored at a navy base, often exposed to scorching heat, for over two years. Mr. Christofias denied personal responsibility for the blast and said the report&rsquo;s claims were not substantiated.
