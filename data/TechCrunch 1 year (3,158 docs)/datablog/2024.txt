Mobile gaming community MocoSpace is releasing the results of a new study focused on virtual goods consumption and engagement by age. The report found younger gamers (25-35) spend the most time playing social games, but gamers over 45 years of age buy exponentially more virtual goods than their younger counterparts. The study surveyed nearly 500,000 gamers on MocoSpaceâ€™s network of 22 million users.Basically, MocoSpace is reporting that age directly correlates with amount of money spent on virtual goods within social games. The older the gamer, the more virtual goods were purchased. Gamers over 35 years of age, who made up 18 percent of gamers surveyed, were responsible for 42 percent of all virtual goods spending. In contrast, 18- to 25-year-olds, who made up 43 percent of those surveyed, were responsible for only 18 percent of virtual goods purchases.The report shows that the 25- to 35-year-old is by far the most active social gaming demographic, spending nearly twice as much time gaming as any other group. Those 45 and older spent the least amount of time playing games.Interestingly, a trend emerged from the study showing younger gamers are less likely to spend on virtual goods, while older gamers are much more likely to buy that sword or shield to advance in a game. Of course, its important to consider that older demographics may have more disposable income, or a desire to progress further within games via virtual goods to save time. The results also highlight that different monetization methods may work for different age groups. If younger gamers spend the most time, an advertising-driven model may be more profitable than a purely virtual goods-based approach. MocoSpace is backed by SoftBank, and has raised $10.5 million in funding.
