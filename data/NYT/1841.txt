A jailed murderer ordered his brother to dig up the corpse of a former president and hide it so he could negotiate his release from prison, a court ruled Monday. The court found the murderer, his brother and another man guilty of unlawfully exhuming the body of Tassos Papadopoulos. The corpse was stolen from a cemetery in Nicosia in 2009. It was later found by the police and reburied.
