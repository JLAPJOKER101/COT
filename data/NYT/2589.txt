PARIS &mdash; The French authorities are dropping a terrorism investigation into 24 members of an Iranian dissident group for lack of evidence, court documents show, nearly eight years after a sensational raid on the organization&rsquo;s headquarters amid charges that the group was planning attacks on targets in Europe.        

Marc Tr&eacute;vidic and Edmond Brunaud, the judges investigating the case for the Paris Tribunal de Grande Instance, a superior court, found that there were no grounds for proceeding with indictments for terrorism or terrorism-related finance, according to the documents, which were dated Wednesday.        

The inquiry grew out of one of France&rsquo;s largest anti-terrorist operations, when 1,300 police officers and intelligence officials descended on June 17, 2003, on the offices of the Mujahedeen Khalq, or People&rsquo;s Mujahedeen Organization of Iran, which wants to overthrow the Tehran government.        

Acting under Nicolas Sarkozy when he was interior minister, the police arrested 120 people at the group&rsquo;s headquarters in Auvers-sur-Oise, near Paris.        

According to classified French documents that were leaked in 2003, the People&rsquo;s Mujahedeen had been plotting to attack Iranian embassies and assassinate former members working with Iranian intelligence services in Europe.        

The People&rsquo;s Mujahedeen maintains that the French state carried out the raid in the hope of winning friends in the Iranian government.        

Maryam Rajavi, head of the group&rsquo;s political arm, said Thursday in a telephone interview, &ldquo;This ruling demonstrates the Iranian people&rsquo;s right to struggle for their freedom.&rdquo;
