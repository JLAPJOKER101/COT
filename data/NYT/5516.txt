The government is charging the ringleaders of street demonstrations this week with treason, officials said Thursday, an offense that can carry the death penalty. The police said that about 40 people had been arrested across the country since Monday, when activists tried to resume demonstrations begun in April against rising commodity prices and government corruption. The police accuse the activists of seeking to overthrow the government. Two members of the group Activists 4 Change were arraigned on treason charges on Wednesday, said Judith Nabakooba, a police spokeswoman. One of them is an assistant to the opposition leader Kizza Besigye. At least nine people were killed and hundreds arrested during protests led by Mr. Besigye this past spring.
