The Scottish police said Tuesday that they had arrested a man in Glasgow on terrorism charges related to a suicide bomber who killed himself and wounded two others in Sweden in December. The arrest came as part of an investigation across Sweden and Britain into the bomber, Taimour Abdulwahab al-Abdaly, 28, who had lived in both countries and who detonated bombs in Stockholm on Dec. 11, 2010. The arrested man was described only as a &ldquo;foreign national.&rdquo;
