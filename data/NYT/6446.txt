The highest chamber of a United Nations-backed tribunal found on Tuesday that a former Khmer Rouge official remains mentally incompetent to stand trial but ordered her continued detention to see if her mental condition improves in six months. The ruling reversed a finding by junior judges that would have freed the defendant, Ieng Thirith, 80, because doctors had concluded she has Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease. She was social affairs minister in the Khmer Rouge regime, which lasted from 1975 to 1979 and was responsible for the deaths of 1.7 million people who were executed or died of starvation or lack of medical care.
