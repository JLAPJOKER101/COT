Dozens of people protested outside a Tripoli prison on Thursday, accusing officials there of mistreating detainees. Most of the protesters at the prison in the Tajura neighborhood were relatives of jailed Qaddafi loyalists. A government spokesman, Mahmoud Shammam, acknowledged that &ldquo;we have a lot of problems in the prisons,&rdquo; but he said most prisons were still under the control of semiautonomous groups of fighters, not the interim government.
