A global health fund that has come under pressure from donors to clean up corruption will resume hundreds of millions of dollars in financing for programs in China to fight AIDS and other diseases, thereby removing a source of embarrassment for Beijing. The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria froze disbursements of its AIDS grant to China in November and all other grants in May over suspected misuse of the money and the government&rsquo;s reluctance to involve community groups. The fund, based in Geneva, said Tuesday that it was lifting the freeze on financing to ensure that AIDS work in China continued while it worked with government officials, representatives from United Nations agencies and private groups to resolve the dispute.
