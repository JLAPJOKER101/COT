In the midst of Amazons recent moves to rapidly grow its content collection on Amazon Prime Instant Video, the company has also been brokering deals for another one of its video properties: European Netflix competitor LOVEFiLM. Today, the company is announcing a new multi-year deal with NBCUniversal International Television Distribution, which will offer LOVEFiLM members access to streaming titles from Universal Pictures during the second pay window.The titles will be available through the LOVEFiLM Instant service, and will start at  £4.99 a month. As with Netflix, the streaming video service supports a wide variety of devices, including PCs, Macs, the iPad, internet-connected TVs and Blu-ray players, as well as game consoles like the Xbox 360 and Sony PlayStation. There are 175 devices, in total, which are supported.The new NBCUniversal deal will bring familiar titles to LOVEFiLMs members, like ‘It’s Complicated’, ‘Nanny McPhee Returns’, ‘Leap Year’, ‘Green Zone’, ‘The Wolfman’, ‘Robin Hood’, ‘Scott Pilgrim vs The World’, ‘The American’, ‘Paul’, ‘Fast And Furious 5’, ‘Bridesmaids’, ‘Johnny English Reborn’, ‘Snow White and the Huntsman’, ‘Bourne Legacy’, ‘Dr Seuss’ The Lorax’ and ‘Safe House’. However, Amazon did not announce the number of new titles the content deal offered. (Perhaps implying its not large enough to boast about?)LOVEFiLM, which Amazon purchased back in January 2011, after having held a large minority stake in the company for some time, has also been trying to wean itself off of DVD rentals like its stateside competitor. The company now has over 2 million members in the U.K., Germany, Sweden, Denmark, and Norway, and hosts over 70,000 titles, DVD, games and streaming combined.Amazon has previously signed streaming video deals for its Prime Instant Video service with Paramount, Discovery, Viacom, 20th Century FOX and others.
