Judges at the International Criminal Court refused on Monday to block the release of a Rwandan rebel whom prosecutors accuse of involvement in deadly attacks by a Hutu militia on villages in the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2009. The judges had ordered the release of the suspect, Callixte Mbarushimana, on Friday after dismissing all charges against him for lack of evidence. Prosecutors said then that they would appeal the ruling and asked the court to delay Mr. Mbarushimana&rsquo;s release.
