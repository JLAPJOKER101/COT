A fire at the Treasury building in downtown Abidjan on Tuesday destroyed financial records on at least three floors, officials said. The fire comes at a time of increasing fiscal strain for the president, Laurent Gbagbo, who is facing international financial sanctions because he has refused to step down after losing an election in November. Last week, the United States ambassador, Phillip Carter, said Mr. Gbagbo had been extorting businesses to pay their taxes in advance.
