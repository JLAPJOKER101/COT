Using tear gas and batons, the police broke up an antigovernment demonstration of several hundred youths in the capital, Nouakchott, on Monday. Echoing protests elsewhere in the region, young people have been rallying against President Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz since the end of February. Mr. Aziz, left, a former general, was elected in 2009 after seizing power in a coup the year before. A rallying cry of the protesters has been that Mr. Aziz used the election merely to legalize his coup, and on Monday the protesters demanded he relinquish power. &ldquo;At about noon they were savagely attacked by the police with batons and tear gas grenades,&rdquo; said an opposition member of Parliament, Mohamed El Moustapha Ould Bedreddine.
