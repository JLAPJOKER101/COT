Somalia is enduring  its worst drought in five years and aid agencies are unable to feed the majority of people in need, a senior United Nations humanitarian official said Friday. Rebels from the Shabab, a radical Islamist group that controls much of the country, have refused to allow food aid to be distributed in southern and central Somalia. The number of Somalis in need of aid has increased by 20 percent in the last six months.  Mark Bowden, the United Nations humanitarian coordinator for Somalia, said half the population might require aid as the drought intensifies.
