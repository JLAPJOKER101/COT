ROME &mdash; With signs reading &ldquo;Enough!&rdquo; and &ldquo;We want a country that respects women,&rdquo; thousands took to the streets across Italy on Sunday in coordinated demonstrations against Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, but their outpouring of frustration did not look poised to bring about political change.        

The demonstrations &mdash; called &ldquo;If not now, when?&rdquo; after a Primo Levi book about the Holocaust &mdash; captured the frustration of Italians angered at the role of women in Mr. Berlusconi&rsquo;s Italy, as well as a deep pessimism about the future and what they see as a growing divide between the country&rsquo;s ills and the government&rsquo;s concerns.        

&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not happy to be a second-rate country or an ugly television soap opera,&rdquo; Susanna Camusso, the leader of the Italian General Confederation of Labor, Italy&rsquo;s largest labor union, said to rousing applause here in Piazza del Popolo, which was packed to the breaking point.        

&ldquo;We want a country in which it&rsquo;s possible for women to live in dignity,&rdquo; Ms. Camusso said, adding that a country that did not sustain women&rsquo;s &ldquo;capacity for growth&rdquo; was &ldquo;a country that goes backward.&rdquo;        

In a sex scandal that has mesmerized Italians, a judge is expected to rule in the coming days on whether Mr. Berlusconi, 74, should be brought to trial on charges that he paid for sex with a 17-year-old woman and intervened in May to help get her released from custody after she was detained for theft. Both deny wrongdoing.        

Ms. Camusso was joined on stage by a politician from Mr. Berlusconi&rsquo;s center-right coalition, as well as a nun and a Moroccan immigrant, among others. Crowds spilled out into nearby streets, dancing to Aretha Franklin&rsquo;s song &ldquo;Respect&rdquo; before 90 seconds of silence and a collective scream of protest.        

Scores of women protested in more than 230 other Italian cities, as well as 28 cities worldwide, including Paris and Tokyo. Organizers in Rome said that one million people had turned out around the world, but official counts were not available.        

Mr. Berlusconi and his defenders have dismissed the demonstrations as purely political, calling his critics &ldquo;moralists&rdquo; and &ldquo;puritans.&rdquo;        

Giulia Bongiorno, the president of the lower house justice committee, countered on Sunday, &ldquo;To say this piazza is filled with &lsquo;moralists&rsquo; is a way of diminishing it.&rdquo;        

Sister Eugenia Bonetti, a nun who works for the Catholic aid organization Caritas in Turin, said she was &ldquo;giving voice to the voiceless&rdquo;: female  victims of sexual exploitation and human trafficking. &ldquo;In their name, we say &lsquo;enough&rsquo; to all this,&rdquo; she said.        

As she stood in Piazza del Popolo, Ginevra Coppotelli, a Roman homemaker, expressed an oft-heard complaint. &ldquo;Berlusconi has insulted women, and even worse, he&rsquo;s given political positions to his whores,&rdquo; she said, referring to  television showgirls who have become politicians in the center-right coalition.        

But it was her husband, Benedetto Bruno, a retired chemist with Italy&rsquo;s Civil Protection Agency, who captured how polarizing Mr. Berlusconi has become. &ldquo;People vote for him because he personifies defects that Italians have in their DNA,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;When you hear about what he does, 80 percent of men think, &lsquo;I wish I were in his place.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;        

Mr. Bruno added, &ldquo;I hate to say this, but Italians don&rsquo;t want to respect laws, they don&rsquo;t want to pay taxes, they want to do as they like, and he personifies this.&rdquo;        

Indeed, the demonstrations were not necessarily expected to translate into political change.        

&ldquo;Nothing will change,&rdquo; Livia Turco, a former minister of social affairs, said as she stood in Piazza del Popolo. Still, she called the demonstration a &ldquo;liberating act&rdquo; against &ldquo;a political class that hasn&rsquo;t dealt with the tangible problems that women face.&rdquo;        

&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an important moment of civil protest that has to be built on,&rdquo; Ms. Turco added.        

In recent weeks, Mr. Berlusconi has survived a series of confidence votes, and his center-right coalition has stood by him. But in a toxic political climate, political analysts say the prospect of early elections may be growing closer.        

Raising the tensions on Sunday, the speaker of the lower house, Gianfranco Fini, who split with Mr. Berlusconi last summer and has formed his own breakaway group, called for early elections, saying he would step down as speaker if Mr. Berlusconi stepped down as prime minister.        

But even if Italy does hold national elections this spring, the center-left opposition is divided,  making it likely that for all his legal woes, Mr. Berlusconi may well be able to win.        

&ldquo;What saddens me the most is the idea that if we go to elections, things will probably stay the same,&rdquo; said Adriana Paris, an elementary school teacher. &ldquo;Berlusconi has touched the bottom, and dragged Italy with it.&rdquo;        

She was pessimistic about the country&rsquo;s future: &ldquo;People have been anesthetized by this man.&rdquo;
