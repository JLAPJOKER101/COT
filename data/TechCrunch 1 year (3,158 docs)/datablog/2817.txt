Steer your way to Google.com and youll find yourself staring at perhaps its boldest Doodle yet. No, Google hasnt outdone itself with another musical tribute or interactive game — its running an ad directing users to try out Google+. But this isnt just your average text ad or banner: Googles drawing a big, blue arrow that points toward your Google+ name on the left side of its top nav bar.  Click it, and youll launch into the Google+ homepage and signup process.You cant miss it.The ad coincides with todays public launch to Google+, which now allows anyone to sign up for the service (up until now youve needed an invite). And its sure to drive a major surge in new signups.Granted, this isnt the first time Google has run ads on its homepage to promote its own products: for example, its previously run ads for its Nexus phones, and it recently ran text ads promoting Google Offers to users in some areas. But as far as I can remember, all of these ads have been subtle — some text and maybe a small graphic centered beneath the search bar.But this blue arrow is much harder to miss (note that the arrow actually moves a bit, as its drawn when you first land on the page). If nothing else, its another reminder of just how serious Google is about helping Google+ succeed, and it shows that its willing to leverage its biggest assets to achieve that mission.
