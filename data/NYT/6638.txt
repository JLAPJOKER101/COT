Cuba has pardoned 2,900 prisoners and may release dozens of foreigners serving jail sentences as a &ldquo;humanitarian gesture,&rdquo; President Ra&uacute;l Castro said Friday.&nbsp;The amnesty will not include Alan Gross, an American contractor whose arrest two years ago has strained relations between Cuba and the United States.&nbsp; Cuba&rsquo;s vice foreign minister, Josefina Vidal, told The Associated Press that Mr. Gross was &ldquo;not on the list.&rdquo; The prisoners, who were pardoned by the Council of State, Cuba&rsquo;s highest governing body, include women, the ailing and people over 60, Mr. Castro said in a speech to Parliament. Those released would also include some convicted of crimes against the state who had served a large part of their prison sentence with good behavior. He said the government would also release 86&nbsp;foreign prisoners from 25 countries, provided that their governments agreed to repatriate them.
