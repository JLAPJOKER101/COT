S&Atilde;O PAULO, Brazil &mdash; Ernesto S&aacute;bato, an acclaimed Argentine novelist who led a commission that investigated crimes committed by the nation&rsquo;s military dictatorship, died Saturday at his home in the Santos Lugares neighborhood of Buenos Aires. He was 99.        

The cause was complications of bronchitis, said Elvira Gonzalez Fraga, his companion and collaborator.        

Although Mr. S&aacute;bato, a physicist who turned to literature in his 30s, wrote just three novels &mdash; &ldquo;The Tunnel&rdquo; (1948), &ldquo;On Heroes and Tombs&rdquo; (1962) and &ldquo;The Angel of Darkness&rdquo; (1974) &mdash; he was as revered in Argentina as his contemporary and countryman Jorge Luis Borges.        

In 1972, the Chilean poet Pablo Neruda listed Mr. S&aacute;bato among the Latin American writers who displayed &ldquo;greater vitality and imagination than anything since the great Russian novels&rdquo; of the 19th century. And in 1984, Mr. S&aacute;bato was awarded the Cervantes Prize for Literature, the most prestigious literary honor in the Spanish-speaking world.        

&ldquo;On Heroes and Tombs,&rdquo; the story of a young man trying to find his way in life in Buenos Aires, is considered his most important work of fiction. But many people know Mr. S&aacute;bato best for his work in helping Argentina heal when democracy was restored in 1983 after seven years of military dictatorship.        

His commission produced a report, &ldquo;Nunca M&aacute;s&rdquo; (&ldquo;Never Again&rdquo;), that documented the atrocities committed by the military in those years and that served as the basis for the prosecution of military leaders.        

Mr. S&aacute;bato was born on June 24, 1911, to Italian immigrant parents in Rojas, a town in Buenos Aires Province. He earned a doctorate in physics from the Universidad Nacional de la Plata in Argentina and worked in the atomic radiation laboratories at the Curie Institute in Paris and later at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. But he abandoned a career in science in 1943, partly out of disillusionment over its destructive power.        

Politically, he was a man of contradictions. He was critical of the governments of Juan Domingo Per&oacute;n, who died in 1974, and his wife, Isabel, who was overthrown in a coup in 1976 and replaced by Gen. Jorge Rafael Videla. But Mr. S&aacute;bato was criticized for initially appearing to support the military dictatorship.        

On May 19, 1976, Mr. S&aacute;bato went to lunch with General Videla, along with Mr. Borges and two other writers. They accepted the lunch in part to ask General Videla about the disappearance of fellow writers like Haroldo Conti, who was never found. After the lunch, Mr. S&aacute;bato told the press that the meeting went well, and he said General Videla was &ldquo;cultured.&rdquo;        

Two years later, Mr. S&aacute;bato told the German magazine Geo that &ldquo;the immense majority of Argentines practically begged for the armed forces to take power,&rdquo; and that the military was able to put a stop to the leftist terrorists who were threatening the stability of the country and the safety of its people.        

Critics like the historian and journalist Osvaldo Bayer said Mr. S&aacute;bato never explained the seeming contradiction of his thoughts and actions during the military dictatorship. Mr. S&aacute;bato, he said, formed part of an &ldquo;the Argentine hypocrisy.&rdquo;        

Mr. S&aacute;bato&rsquo;s opinion about the dictatorship later hardened. At a 1981 meeting of Argentine writers in Buenos Aires he helped draft a statement of protest concerning writers who had disappeared.        

&ldquo;This young generation has known so much sadness and anguish,&rdquo; he said in an interview that year. &ldquo;But someday they will produce a creative explosion. Sadness is what teaches.&rdquo;        

In the late 1970s, Mr. S&aacute;bato, who had been a prolific and passionate essayist as well as a novelist, learned he had lesions on his retina, and his doctor recommended that he not read or write again. From that point, he expressed himself mostly through select interviews.        

When Ra&uacute;l Alfons&iacute;n was elected president of Argentina in 1983, marking the country&rsquo;s return to democracy, he appointed Mr. S&aacute;bato to lead a commission that was charged with producing a comprehensive record of the atrocities committed by the military dictatorship from 1976 to 1983.        

After nine and a half months of investigation, the commission produced &ldquo;Nunca M&aacute;s,&rdquo; which compiled evidence of about 9,000 &ldquo;disappeared&rdquo; persons who had been arbitrarily arrested, detained and tortured. (Human rights organizations place the total number at 30,000.)        

After compiling the report, which contained more than 50,000 pages of documentation, Mr. S&aacute;bato wrote in a widely cited preface that &ldquo;we have the certainty that the military dictatorship produced the greatest tragedy of our history, and the most savage.&rdquo;        

An estimated 70,000 people demonstrated in favor of democracy in front of Government House in Buenos Aires when Mr. S&aacute;bato handed &ldquo;Nunca M&aacute;s&rdquo; to Mr. Alfons&iacute;n on Sept. 20, 1984.        

Mr. S&aacute;bato was married for more than 60 years to Matilde Kusminsky Richter, who died in 1998. In addition to Ms. Gonzalez Fraga, Mr. S&aacute;bato is survived by a son, Mario, and several grandchildren and great-grandchildren.
