Last year, popular live video platform Ustream launched a mobile app development platform called Ustream Live Mobilizer that offered brands, celebrities, and bands a customizable iPhone application that featured Ustream’s live steaming capabilities. But today, Ustream is shutting down Live Mobilizer and announcing a partnership with Mobile Roadie, which allows anyone develop and create sleek, rich media iPhone and Android apps. Mobile Roadie will work with Ustream broadcasters to create mobile apps that showcase their Ustream live channels as well as a number of of other complimentary features. For example, Mobile Roadies Ustream apps will send push messages automatically when a broadcaster goes live, will allow visitors to “Check in” to a stream and share to Facebook and Twitter, will collect real-time analytics and location data on broadcaster live streams, and will allow users to chat with each other as they view a live stream.Broadcasters will also be able to monetize the app, and can charge a one time or monthly fee for users to their Ustream content. Mobile Roadie says that existing Ustream clients using Live Mobilizer will have the option to migrate to the new platform. Outsourcing mobile app development to Mobile Roadie makes a lot of sense for Ustream, who can focus on doing what they do best—live streaming. Mobile Roadie has become a defacto mobile app development platform for a number of high profile brands and celebrities using its platform, including Taylor Swift (see the example of the Ustream integration in this post), Madonna, Live Nation, Levi’s, Twilight, and Vera Wang. In 2009, Mobile Roadie also developed the official iPhone app for LeWeb,, struck a deal with Random House  to power iPhone apps for authors, and Sony Music to develop mobile apps for the music labels network of artists.
