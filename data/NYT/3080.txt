Ash from a volcano in Chile&rsquo;s Caulle Cord&oacute;n grounded most air travel to and from Argentina. Since the ash can damage jet engines, Aerolineas Argentinas and Austral, the country&rsquo;s state-owned airlines, canceled all flights, and at least six international carriers suspended travel between Buenos Aires and cities in the United States and Europe. Airports closest to the volcano were ordered closed through Sunday.
