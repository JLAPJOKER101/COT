If they haven’t already done it, Sprint customers in need of an upgrade should make it a point to circle April 22 on their calendars.Not only has Sprint chosen that day to launch their eco-friendly LG Viper, the nation’s third largest wireless carrier has just confirmed on Twitter that the Galaxy Nexus will be available for $199 (with contract) that same day.As far as the device’s hardware goes, hardly anything has changed since it launched on Verizon late last year. Rumors of a slightly snappier processor have been shot down  the Sprint Galaxy Nexus retains the 1.2GHz dual-core chipset seen in its cousin, as well as the 32GB of internal storage and super-fast 5-megapixel rear camera.Going for the Galaxy on Sprint does have a few advantages though, especially if you’ve chosen to dive headlong into Googles ecosystem of services.Google has arguably had a closer relationship with Sprint than most other wireless carriers here in the States — Sprint is still the only carrier to provide considerable integration with Google Voice, and Sprint’s Nexus S 4G was the first device to officially get Google Wallet support. Sprints Galaxy Nexus seems to keep that tradition going strong, as anyone who activates Google Wallet on their GalNex within seven days of purchase will get a $40 Google Wallet credit on top of the standard $10 that comes pre-loaded.Between these two devices and HTC’s Evo 4G LTE, Sprint has got a hell of an LTE portfolio in place. Sadly, there’s still no sign of that much-anticipated LTE network (outside of Kankakee, Illinois anyway), so those of you looking to take the plunge will have to putter along on 3G for a little while yet.
