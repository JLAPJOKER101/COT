Prosecutors in Rome ordered the release on Wednesday of 23 million Euros, or almost $33 million, seized from the Vatican Bank last year in a continuing money-laundering investigation. They said they released the money after the Vatican instituted new mechanisms to help it adhere to international anti-money laundering and antiterrorist financing standards. The changes included creating a financial watchdog to coordinate with international organizations &mdash; a new leaf for an organization known for its opaque finances. The Vatican on Wednesday said it &ldquo;appreciated&rdquo; the release of the funds. Prosecutors had preventively seized the funds last September and placed the bank&rsquo;s top two financial officers under investigation on the grounds that they transferred the money without properly disclosing the sender or motive. The two officials remain under investigation but have not been charged with a crime. The Vatican has said the investigation is the result of a misunderstanding.
