Sudan&rsquo;s health minister said Tuesday that he had quit because members of the north&rsquo;s dominant party, the National Congress Party, had been making decisions in the ministry behind his back. The minister, Abdallah Tiya, belongs to the Sudan People&rsquo;s Liberation Movement party, a mostly southern group. His resignation highlights schisms in Sudan&rsquo;s government of national unity, which will dissolve in July when southern Sudan secedes.
