Given the widespread problems folks are having with iOS 5 we thought wed share a few of the features and associated apps with you all. This update is fairly major  some would call it iOS catching up to some of the best features of Android, especially the interesting new notifications screen  but there was surprisingly little to really show. Most of the features are hidden behind the scenes and the improvements like multitouch gestures have a bit of a tacked-on feel at worst and are inconsequential at best. That said, this is an interesting move for iOS in general and, although I filmed this on the iPad, I think iOS 5 really shines on the smaller iPhone screen, especially with the addition of notification widgets like Weather and the stock ticker.
