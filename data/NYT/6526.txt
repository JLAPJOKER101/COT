UNITED NATIONS (AP) &mdash; The United Nations Security Council ordered the assets of two Libyan banks that had been under the control of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi to be unfrozen on Friday, clearing the way for the return of more than $40 billion to help the new government rebuild the country.        

The transitional government had asked the Council&rsquo;s sanctions committee to lift the asset freeze on the Central Bank of Libya and its subsidiary, the Libyan Foreign Bank. There were no objections from any of the 15 Council nations who make up the committee by the deadline on Friday evening, so the sanctions were immediately lifted.        

Soon after, the United States government announced that it had rolled back most sanctions against Libya&rsquo;s banks, unblocking more than $30 billion in assets. Foreign Secretary William Hague of Britain said his government was seeking swift European Union action to pass the regulation required to release about $10 billion in assets frozen in Britain.        

Billions of dollars more in Libyan assets frozen elsewhere are also expected to be released.        

The Council froze the assets of five key Libyan financial institutions in March, after Colonel Qaddafi&rsquo;s deadly crackdown on the uprising against his 42-year rule.
