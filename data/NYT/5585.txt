Amnesty International said Tuesday that the Dominican Republic&rsquo;s national police force was responsible for killing and torturing with impunity and for, on average, 15 percent of the violent deaths recorded from 2005 to 2010. The report said that &ldquo;hard-line policing methods&rdquo; were contributing to an increase in violence and crime rather than helping to curb it, and that police abuse had flourished because of inadequate government oversight. Col. M&aacute;ximo B&aacute;ez, a spokesman, said the police were not allowed to present their side of the events cited to the group.
