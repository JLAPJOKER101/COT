At least 38 people died in the Democratic Republic of Congo when the boat they were traveling in capsized on Monday, the Red Cross said. The boat was ferrying goods and people across Lake Kivu from Minova, near Goma, to Bukavu when it tipped over and sank around 4 a.m., according to the provincial police chief, Gen. Augustin Luzembo. A rescue team from the Red Cross recovered 38 bodies and 12 survivors, and the death toll was expected to rise. Survivors told the Red Cross more than 100 people were on board.
