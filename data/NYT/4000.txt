The Russian government cautioned in a statement issued Wednesday that it would &ldquo;not leave unanswered the unfriendly steps&rdquo; taken by the United States in barring several dozen Russian officials from receiving American visas over their involvement in the detention and death of the Russian lawyer Sergei L. Magnitsky two years ago. It was one of the Obama administration&rsquo;s sharpest responses yet to human rights abuses in Russia. The Russian Foreign Ministry said in its statement that the visa ban, coming into force despite the thaw in the two countries&rsquo; relations, represented &ldquo;an instrument of the past.&rdquo;
