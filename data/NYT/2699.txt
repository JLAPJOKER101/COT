There were conflicting reports on Wednesday about a shooting at the border between Georgia and South Ossetia, a breakaway enclave under Russia&rsquo;s military protection. The government of Georgia accused &ldquo;occupation forces&rdquo; of firing on unarmed civilians it said were gathering herbs near the boundary, wounding two, one of them seriously. But South Ossetian officials said that members of the enclave&rsquo;s K.G.B., which patrols the boundary, discovered a group of Georgian youths inside the border. According to Res, an Ossetian news service, a firefight was begun from the Georgian side and Georgian citizens were arrested. South Ossetia gained de facto independence in 2008 after Russia and Georgia fought a short war over it and another rebellious territory.
