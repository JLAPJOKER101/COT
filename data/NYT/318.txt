Russian air traffic controllers failed to warn the crew of President Lech Kaczynski of Poland&rsquo;s plane that it was off course shortly before it crashed last year in Russia, Polish investigators said Tuesday. Interior Minister Jerzy Miller  made the claim nearly a week after the release of a Russian report that laid the blame squarely on the Poles. The April 10 crash in  Smolensk, Russia, killed Mr. Kaczynski and 95 others.  The crash has revived tensions between Poland and Russia that the countries had worked to overcome. All along, there has been agreement that the Polish pilots&rsquo; decision to land in heavy fog was an important reason for the crash. Yet the Polish authorities have reacted with anger to the Russian report, which suggested that the pilot felt pressure to land because the president had in the past made clear that he did not like his trips delayed.
