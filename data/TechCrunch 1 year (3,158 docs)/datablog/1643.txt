Its hard not to love the Galaxy Nexus, even if youre not a Fandroid. With a 4.65-inch 720p display, a 1.2GHz dual-core processor and Android 4.0 ICS to boot, whats not to love? Well, if youre being picky, perhaps youre yearning for a white GalNex, in which case I have good and bad news. Which do you want first? The good news is that the white Galaxy Nexus is indeed an official product and it will be available on February 13, which gives you a whole day to use a combination of Google Wallet and Fab to find your sweetheart a nice Valentines Day gift. The bad news is that, according to TrustedReviews, the white GalNex is only available to the UK this week. (Bad news for us, anyways.)Wait, theres one extra bonus bit of good news: If you have enough dough, the white GalNex is has a pentaband HSPA+ radio, meaning it will work on both AT&T and T-Mobiles networks. And by enough dough, I specifically mean at least Â£496.79 ($770), which is what the 16GB model seems to be going for over at UK online retailer Handtec. Past its pale appearance, all the specs will remain the same between the black and white models. However, if you happen to remember when we first noticed the white Galaxy Nexus, youll recall that the render within the post showed an all-white bezel. That isnt the case with the official version, as the front bezel of the phone is still solid black and the back portion of the phone is white.
