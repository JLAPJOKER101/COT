MOSCOW &mdash; A Georgian negotiator said Saturday that talks with Russia on its joining the World Trade Organization had broken down and that Georgia was prepared to veto Russia&rsquo;s membership, despite American support for Russia&rsquo;s bid.        

Accession to the trade organization is typically done through consensus among its 153 member nations, so Georgia can block the entrance of Russia, a bitter enemy since the two countries went to war in 2008.        

Russia, the largest economy outside the W.T.O., first applied for membership 18 years ago, and a failure now would strike a serious blow to relations between Moscow and Washington.        

Deputy Foreign Minister Sergi Kapanadze, who led Georgia&rsquo;s delegation to the talks in Switzerland, said by telephone that Russian negotiators had refused to share information about trade that passes in or out of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, two breakaway Georgian territories. In 2008, Russia sent its military to aid separatists in the enclaves, leading to the war. Russia proceeded to recognize them as sovereign nations.        

&ldquo;If the Russians don&rsquo;t change their position, we will have to block&rdquo; the country from joining the trade organization, Mr. Kapanadze said on Saturday.        

A deal would have to be finalized in the coming days if Russia is to become a member at the W.T.O.&rsquo;s meeting in December, as Russian and American officials hope. Russian officials have suggested that the United States, a longtime ally of Georgia&rsquo;s, could pressure it to drop its objections.
