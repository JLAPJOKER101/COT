The federal police have arrested a state police officer in connection with the arson attack on a casino in northern Mexico that left 52 people dead, while five others detained earlier remain in custody. The unidentified state officer, arrested Thursday, was one of several men seen in surveillance camera video arriving at the casino in Monterrey in a caravan. Some of the men rushed in to set the building ablaze in what the authorities suspect may have been retaliation for not paying an extortion demand. Also, Jon&aacute;s Larrazabal, the brother of the mayor of Monterrey, was questioned by prosecutors on Thursday after he was seen in another casino accepting wads of cash. He has said the payments were for selling cheese and other products from his native state, Oaxaca.
