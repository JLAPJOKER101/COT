About 7,500 victims of human rights abuses during the rule of the late dictator Ferdinand E. Marcos will receive compensation for their suffering starting next week, 25 years after a peaceful revolt forced Mr. Marcos from power, their lawyers said Thursday. It is the first time the victims will receive any compensation since they filed a suit in 1986. A United States District Court awarded $7.5 million last month to 7,526 members of a class-action lawsuit. The lead lawyer, Robert Swift, said victims would receive the equivalent of $1,000 each. He said the amount was not adequate, but more money might be forthcoming.
