TUNIS (Reuters) &mdash; Tunisian police officers fired into the air to disperse rioters here in the capital early on Sunday. In another city they were attacked by crowds throwing gasoline bombs.        

The rioting was the starkest sign to date of the friction between Tunisia&rsquo;s secular establishment and Islamists who have been growing more assertive since the country&rsquo;s autocratic leader was ousted in a revolution six months ago.        

The government said the rioting was orchestrated by extremist groups trying to undermine stability. Officials characterized the rioters as Islamists because of their beards, which are typical of the country&rsquo;s Islamists.        

The violence was set off by an episode on Friday when the police, trying to break up an antigovernment demonstration in the center of Tunis, fired tear gas inside a mosque.        

On Saturday, about 200 youths, many of them with beards, set fire to a police station in the Intilaka district in the west of Tunis. The police responded by shooting into the air and using tear gas, while a police helicopter hovered overhead. The clashes continued until about 3:00 a.m. Sunday.        

In the town of Menzel Bourguiba, about 45 miles north of Tunis, four police officers were wounded in clashes with rioters, a police official said.        

&ldquo;Angry youths threw stones and Molotov cocktails at the police before heading to a police station to set it on fire,&rdquo; said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.        

&ldquo;It was a terrible night,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know what caused it, but it is clear that among them there were lots of people with beards.&rdquo;
