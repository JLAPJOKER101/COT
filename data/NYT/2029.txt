More than 5,000 Czechs have signed up to a Facebook campaign to mail pens to President Vaclav Klaus after a video of him sheepishly pocketing a pen during an official signing ceremony in Chile became widely popular on the Internet. Mr. Klaus says that it is customary for leaders to keep pens after signing accords. But the manner in which he sized up the pen &mdash; encrusted with semiprecious Chilean stones &mdash; and then slipped it into his pocket last week while he sat at a desk alongside President Sebasti&aacute;n Pi&ntilde;era of Chile has provoked ridicule from some of his countrymen. Campaign participants are being asked to send the presidential office pens, pencils or other writing tools because the president &ldquo;obviously has nothing to write with.&rdquo;
