MEXICO CITY &mdash; Laura Poll&aacute;n Toledo, a former high school Spanish teacher who became one of Cuba&rsquo;s most public dissidents as she led other wives of political prisoners in protest every Sunday, died in a Havana hospital on Friday, her family and other dissidents said. She was 63.        



She entered the hospital on Oct. 7 after she developed a respiratory illness, and she died of cardiac arrest, her family said.        

Ms. Poll&aacute;n founded the Ladies in White after the Cuban government arrested her husband, H&eacute;ctor Maseda, an independent journalist, in March 2003 during a crackdown on political dissent known as the Black Spring. In all, 75 men were arrested and sentenced after one-day trials to terms ranging from 6 to 28 years. Mr. Maseda was given a 20-year sentence for acting against &ldquo;the territorial integrity of the state.&rdquo;        

Encountering the wives of the other dissidents as she traveled from office to office seeking news of her husband, Ms. Poll&aacute;n founded the Ladies in White to press for the men&rsquo;s release.        

&ldquo;This fight will continue,&rdquo; Berta Soler, the group&rsquo;s spokeswoman, told the Spanish news agency EFE. &ldquo;Physically, Laura is no longer with us, but she is spiritually.&rdquo;        

The women march through the main streets of Havana after attending Mass, each dressed in white and holding a single gladiolus. They often face down angry pro-government mobs, who surround them and scream insults in what the Cuban government has called &ldquo;acts of repudiation.&rdquo;        

In 2005, the European Parliament awarded the group the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought, but Ms. Poll&aacute;n was not permitted to travel to Europe to accept it.        

Some of the prisoners were released over the years on medical grounds, but 50 were still in prison last year, when the Roman Catholic Church and the Spanish government succeeded in negotiating with President Ra&uacute;l Castro for their freedom.        

Most of the men were released on the condition that they fly into exile, but about a dozen refused to leave the island. Among those was Ms. Poll&aacute;n&rsquo;s husband, who was not freed until this February.        

While in prison, Mr. Maseda smuggled out his memoir, titled &ldquo;Buried Alive.&rdquo; Ms. Poll&aacute;n sent the book to Fidel Castro in 2008, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.        

The release and exile of the prisoners robbed the group of vigor as some of its members left the island with their husbands. But Ms. Poll&aacute;n and other women continued to march every week.        

&ldquo;We are going to continue. We are fighting for freedom and human rights,&rdquo; Ms. Poll&aacute;n told The Associated Press last month.        

&ldquo;As long as this government is around there will be prisoners,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Because while they&rsquo;ve let some go, they&rsquo;ve put others in jail. It is a never-ending story.&rdquo;        

Just two weeks before she was hospitalized, a crowd gathered outside Ms. Poll&aacute;n&rsquo;s house in Havana, jeering, jostling and shouting at the Ladies in White as they met to attend Mass.
