CAIRO (AP) &mdash; Former President Hosni Mubarak, who held absolute power in Egypt for nearly 30 years, will go on trial on Aug. 3 on charges of corruption and intentionally killing unarmed protesters, a court official said Wednesday.        

Mr. Mubarak&rsquo;s two sons will be tried at the same time on charges of corruption.        

Abdel-Aziz Omar of Egypt&rsquo;s Court of Appeals set the trial date, the Middle East News Agency reported. The decision will put the Mubaraks in court six months after the elder Mr. Mubarak stepped down and transferred power to a military council on Feb. 11.        

Since he resigned, revolts have swept Yemen, Libya and Syria, but entrenched leaders in those countries have remained in power and have used security forces and their militaries to suppress protesters demanding democratic reforms.        

Mr. Mubarak could face the death penalty if convicted. At least 846 protesters were killed during the 18-day revolt in Egypt.        

The location of the trial was uncertain, because a government-appointed panel of doctors determined on Tuesday that Mr. Mubarak, 83, was too ill to be put in jail while awaiting trial.        

The doctors said Mr. Mubarak&rsquo;s heart condition put him at risk of a sudden attack.
