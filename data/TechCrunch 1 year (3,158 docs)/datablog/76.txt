Mobile wallet platform Lemon released an Android application and a Smarter Wallet Business Plan today.The company, which launched in late 2011 and recently raised $8 million in Series A, claims that over two million customers have used Lemon’s mobile wallet platform. The wallet only launched last month, yet they claim over half a million credit cards have been scanned.Lemon says they are targeting a portion of the market ignored by Google Wallet, Square and others, helping users organize and use their money better.Android users will be able to download the app from Google Play for any Android 4.0 or higher smartphone, with similar experiences to the iOS app.Founder and CEO Wences Casares tells me the company developed Lemon Business after many consumer-side customers, many of whom are lawyers and consultants, asked Lemon for tools to process business expenses. Users can submit receipts directly to their employer for reimbursement through the app (say goodbye to those expense reports!), which Lemon says is secure, trackable and IRS compliant.“Our new Lemon for Business offering is designed to eliminate tiresome tracking and endless expense report paperwork that is burdensome for all sides of the reporting process,” Casares said in a press release. “There are no hardware costs, no IT upkeep, and the app is highly secure, while also meeting IRS expense tracking requirements.”Lemon Business is available from $6.99 to $9.99 per employee per month, depending on the number of employees you have. For consumers, there is a basic, free Lemon and Lemon Pro ($9.99 per month), with extra features (duh).While I personally havent started using the app, I would love to get rid of paper receipts, both for personal spending and reimbursements. Of course, as my boss parody Twitter account (how many people can say that?) points out, the simplification isnt always as good as it seems.Instead of a wallet full of loyalty cards I now have a phone full of apps for loyalty cards. Great job geniuses.— Fake Alexia (@alexia_tsotsis) June 20, 2012
