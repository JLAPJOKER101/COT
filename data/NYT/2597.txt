The International Criminal Court called on the United Nations Security Council on Thursday to take action over the failure of Djibouti to arrest the Sudanese president, an indicted war crimes suspect, during a visit this week. President Omar Hassan al-Bashir of Sudan, left, has been indicted by the court for genocide in Darfur. The court, based in The Hague, has no police force and relies on countries that have signed the agreement creating the court to enforce its arrest warrants. Mr. Bashir&rsquo;s trip to Djibouti on Sunday was the third time that he had visited a member country and not been arrested.
