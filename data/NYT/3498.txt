KHARTOUM, Sudan (Reuters) &mdash; Northern and southern Sudan have agreed to create a demilitarized buffer zone along their border to defuse tensions before the south becomes independent on July 9, the African Union said Wednesday.        

South Sudan voted for independence this year in a referendum under a 2005 peace accord that ended decades of civil war.        

Both sides have yet to agree, however, on a variety of issues, including which country will control the Abyei region, which straddles the ill-defined 1,250-mile border.        

The north and south will remove all military forces from a zone about six miles on each side of the border, the African Union said after the latest rounds of talks between northern and southern officials in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.        

International peacekeepers aided by the African Union and the United Nations, along with observers from both sides, will monitor the buffer zone.        

A northern Sudanese official said checkpoints would monitor movements inside the zone.
