Motion-sensing cameras on the island of Sumatra captured video of two families of endangered tigers in a lowland forest scheduled for destruction, the World Wildlife Fund said Monday. Twelve tigers, including two adult females with cubs, passed in front of the cameras over two months between the Bukit Tigapuluh National Park and nearby mountains. Asia Pulp and Paper has plans to clear large areas of the forest.
