The corruption trial of former President Jacques Chirac, suspended in March, can go ahead, France&rsquo;s highest appeals court ruled Friday. Mr. Chirac, 78, the first former French president to go on trial since Marshal Philippe P&eacute;tain after World War II, is accused of embezzling public funds as Paris mayor to pay people working for his party. He has denied knowledge of any illegal payments. Co-defendants had argued in vain that some charges were unconstitutional under the statute of limitations.
