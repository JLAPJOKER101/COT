Royal Dutch Shell said Friday that it had closed a valve from which oil was spilling into the North Sea, calling it a &ldquo;key step&rdquo; in stopping the leak at its Gannet Alpha platform. Glen Cayley, technical director of Shell&rsquo;s exploration and production in Europe, said divers sealed off the valve in a &ldquo;careful and complex operation.&rdquo; About 1,300 barrels of oil have leaked since Aug. 12, the company said.
