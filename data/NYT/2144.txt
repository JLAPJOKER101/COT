Representatives from the four countries that share the lower reaches of the Mekong River said Tuesday that they failed to reach agreement on plans for a controversial dam in Laos. At a meeting in Vientiane, the Laotian capital, officials from Laos, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam postponed a decision on the Xayaburi dam, which would be the first across the Mekong south of the Chinese border. The dam is the first in a series of large-scale hydroelectric projects on the Mekong that the cash-strapped Laotian government is pursuing in order to sell electricity to other countries. Cambodia and Thailand recommended further studies of the dam&rsquo;s environmental impact, and Vietnam, which fears deleterious effects to the Mekong Delta, called for a moratorium on dams across the Mekong. The governments did not say when they would meet to decide the issue.
