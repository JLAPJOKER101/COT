WASHINGTON &mdash; An assertion by Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta that Iran could have a nuclear weapon as soon as next year was based on a highly aggressive timeline and a series of actions that Iran has not yet taken, senior Pentagon officials said Tuesday.        

In an interview broadcast Monday on &ldquo;CBS Evening News,&rdquo; Mr. Panetta was asked whether Iran could have a nuclear weapon in 2012.        

&ldquo;It would be sometime around a year that they would be able to do it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Perhaps a little less.&rdquo;        

Mr. Panetta said the country&rsquo;s ability to become a nuclear-weapons state could be accelerated if there was &ldquo;a hidden facility somewhere in Iran that may be enriching fuel.&rdquo;        

He also restated American policy: that it would be unacceptable for Iran to have nuclear weapons, and that no options, including military action, had been taken off the table to prevent that from happening.        

&ldquo;The United States does not want Iran to develop a nuclear weapon,&rdquo; Mr. Panetta said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a red line for us. And it&rsquo;s a red line, obviously, for the Israelis.&rdquo;        

But on Tuesday, George Little, the Pentagon press secretary, said Mr. Panetta&rsquo;s comments should not be taken as a prediction that Iran would have a nuclear weapon within a year.        

&ldquo;The secretary was clear that we have no indication that the Iranians have made a decision to develop a nuclear weapon,&rdquo; Mr. Little said. &ldquo;He was asked to comment on prospective and aggressive timelines on Iran&rsquo;s possible production of nuclear weapons &mdash; and he said if, and only if, they made such a decision. He didn&rsquo;t say that Iran would, in fact, have a nuclear weapon in 2012.&rdquo;        

Mr. Little said inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency remained in Iran and had &ldquo;good access to Iran&rsquo;s continuing production of low-enriched uranium.&rdquo; Should Iran choose to &ldquo;break out&rdquo; &mdash; diverting low-enriched uranium to produce weapons-grade highly enriched uranium &mdash; the inspectors could detect it, Mr. Little said.        

&ldquo;We would retain sufficient time under any such scenario to take appropriate action,&rdquo; he said.        

Mr. Panetta&rsquo;s comments and efforts by his senior aides to add nuance and context to those statements show the highly sensitive nature of all public dialogue on Iran&rsquo;s nuclear intentions. The issue is particularly acute as a debate is raging in Israel over whether pre-emptive action is required to prevent Iran from constructing a nuclear weapon, and, if so, how much time remains.
