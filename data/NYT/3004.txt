Dozens of pregnant teenagers could face charges after being accused of planning to sell their babies to a child trafficking operation, officials said Thursday. Thirty-two girls between 15 and 18 years old were arrested Saturday during the raid of a clinic in Abia State, the state police chief said. The director of the clinic was also arrested, accused of buying babies from the young mothers for $160 to $190 and selling them to childless couples for up to $6,400. He denied the charge, saying he was a volunteer doctor who placed unwanted babies in orphanages.
