Prime Minister Naoto Kan said Friday he would not resign after acknowledging that his campaign office had unknowingly received illegal donations from a foreign supporter, days after his foreign minister stepped down for a similar reason. Mr. Kan, left, told a parliamentary committee that he did not know the donor was a foreign national.
