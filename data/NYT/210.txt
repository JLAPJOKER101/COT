More than 60 percent of registered voters already have cast ballots in an independence referendum for southern Sudan, crossing the threshold needed for the vote to be valid, an official in the south said Wednesday. The official, Ann Itto, said that nearly 2.3 million voters had cast ballots so far. The voting began Sunday and will end Saturday; it is expected to be a vote for independence.
