Four men and a woman suspected of being Irish Republican Army dissidents were arrested Friday after British Army experts defused a pipe bomb in Belfast, the provincial capital of Northern Ireland, the police said. Officers arrested two of the suspects near a residential area, where the bomb was found abandoned in an alleyway. I.R.A. dissidents oppose Northern Ireland&rsquo;s 1998 peace accord and the Catholic-Protestant government it forged. Most I.R.A. members disarmed and renounced violence in 2005.
