After months of hype, its been pretty quKÃ¼list is a new service iet around Pinterest for the last few weeks. According to the latest data we just received from Shareaholic, however, the social photo sharing site is still growing quickly, though judging from the companys referral data, Pinterests growth has slowed down a bit since June. From May to June Pinterests referral traffic to Shareaholics network of about 200,000 sites grew by 43.7%. From June to July, it only increased by 15.97%. Even at this slower growth rate, Pinterest is still on track to surpass referral traffic from Yahoo in August. This, says Shareaholic, means Pinterest will soon be the fourth largest traffic source in the world.Today, Pinterest already drives more traffic to sites that use Shareaholic than Bing and Twitter and its only 0.10% away from overtaking Yahoo. Google, of course, remains the largest driver of traffic to the companys member sites, followed by Facebook and  for the time being  Yahoo.As our own Sarah Perez reported a few weeks ago, it was only in June that Pinterest passed Bing, Twitter and Stumbleupon in the companys rankings.Google+, by the way, doesnt even appear in Shareaholics graphs, but as a company spokesperson told me earlier today, it accounted for a minuscule 0.06% of its referral traffic last month.Shareaholic says its data is based on referral traffic to more than 200,000 publishers who reach more than 270 million people each month. Its important to keep in mind that this data doesnt necessarily reflect the Internet as a whole, but the companys data has generally been quite similar to what weve seen from other third-party analytics services.
