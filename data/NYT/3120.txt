BEIJING &mdash; The Chinese authorities appear to be restricting attempts by a handful of citizens to run in local legislative elections as self-proclaimed independent candidates, stating that such candidacies are illegal and that no one can run for office without first clearing a series of procedural hurdles.        

The decision, published Wednesday by the news agency Xinhua and Thursday in the People&rsquo;s Daily, a Communist Party newspaper, appeared to some to reflect official concern about the Communist Party&rsquo;s grip on the election process in a society whose members are increasingly linked by the Internet. Dozens of people recently had signaled on microblogs that they intended to mount their own campaigns for seats in local versions of the National People&rsquo;s Congress, China&rsquo;s quasi legislature.        

Some candidates suggested, however, that the ruling did little to formally outlaw grass-roots campaigns by candidates who lack the party&rsquo;s official blessing.        

&ldquo;Over all, I think the official response is a little more positive than negative,&rdquo; said Xu Zhiyong, a prominent civil rights lawyer elected in 2003 to the People&rsquo;s Congress in central Beijing&rsquo;s Haidian district as an upstart candidate. &ldquo;Legally, there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with what was said.&rdquo;        

At the same time, citizens still have a right to proclaim themselves &ldquo;independent candidates,&rdquo; Mr. Xu maintained, &ldquo;just as they have a right to choose their own names.&rdquo;        

The local legislatures choose members every five years in elections that the government hails as an exercise in grass-roots democracy. Xinhua reports that up to 900 million voters would choose two million legislators for offices that roughly correspond to American city councils.        

In practice, candidates are largely handpicked by Communist Party officials and committees, and outsiders are frequently discouraged from seeking office. Candidates have run their own campaigns and won office in the past, but victories have been exceedingly rare and re-election even more difficult.        

The statement in People&rsquo;s Daily, which quoted an unnamed National People&rsquo;s Congress official, said that election rules permitted only &ldquo;official deputy candidates&rdquo; who have negotiated a series of procedures to run for office. &ldquo;There are no so-called &lsquo;independent candidates,&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; the statement said, &ldquo;and &lsquo;independent candidates&rsquo; have no legal basis.&rdquo;        

The article also hinted that grass-roots campaigning of the sort spawned on microblogs this year might run afoul of the rules. Xinhua quoted the unnamed National People&rsquo;s Congress official as stating, &ldquo;Introductions of candidates must be arranged by electoral committees in strict accordance with the law.&rdquo;        

Under the rules, candidates for county and township offices first must register and be deemed qualified to run for office, then secure support from at least 10 local voters, a political party or a citizens&rsquo; organization. The list of candidates is then winnowed by &ldquo;the majority of opinions in the constituency,&rdquo; the official was quoted as saying, and all subsequent campaigning is regulated by official electoral committees.        

Candidates who lack official favor frequently find their route to office blocked, even if they meet legal qualifications.        

The investigative business magazine Caixin on Tuesday detailed the efforts of one woman, Liu Ping, who sought to run in a Jiangxi Province district election in April. Ms. Liu was not allowed to pick up nomination forms for her supporters to sign, the magazine reported. Some supporters were warned by telephone to stop backing her.        

In the end, she was barred from seeking office &ldquo;according to the party constitution and your previous behavior,&rdquo; a comment that appeared to be a reference to an earlier attempt to petition Beijing officials about workers&rsquo; grievances.        

Mr. Xu said that popular enthusiasm for this round of national grass-roots elections appeared to be considerably greater than the last round in 2006, calling it &ldquo;the result of progress in society as a whole, socially, economically and in the overall amount of freedom on the Internet.&rdquo; Despite official &ldquo;conservatism&rdquo; within the government, he added, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s clear that citizens are actively trying to participate in elections.&rdquo;        

It remained to be seen, though, whether these self-proclaimed candidates might have success in the electoral process, he said. &ldquo;To some extent, it will depend on the attitudes in the electoral districts, and on the candidates&rsquo; own efforts,&rdquo; he said.        

Mr. Xu, who founded a noted nonprofit advocacy group, was detained for more than three weeks on suspicion of tax evasion in 2009, and he has been subject to tight surveillance and frequent harassment from the authorities, even as he completes his own term as a district &ldquo;people&rsquo;s deputy&rdquo; in Beijing.        

One self-proclaimed independent, Li Chengpeng, wrote on his microblog on Thursday that &ldquo;it is probably more appropriate to call independent candidates &lsquo;jointly recommended candidates.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;        

&ldquo;If my understanding is correct,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;the above statement by People&rsquo;s Congress actually implies that citizens can run for local elections if jointly recommended by the public.&rdquo;
