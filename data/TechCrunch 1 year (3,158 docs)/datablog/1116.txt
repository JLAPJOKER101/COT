A number of startups are trying to take on online classifieds giant Craigslist, including Antego, EggDrop, and many others. Tradyo is one of the latest companies to join the group, offering a social, mobile marketplace that allows users to buy and sell items with others around them.The startup’s iPhone app allows users to buy and sell used goods in your area in realtime. The app uses GPS to reveal the items available around you, allowing you to sell an item, search your community for cool stuff, and receive push notifications when an item you want gets listed, or when someone wants to buy what you’ve listed.Tradyo also encourages users to connect their Facebook and Twitter accounts to verify themselves. In addition, Tradyo also offers an in-app instant messaging ability that allows you to see when a buyer or seller has read a message. Finally, if you cant find what you’re looking for on Tradyo, you can set up an alert and Tradyo will notify you when it is available in the marketplace.Similar to the other startups in the space, Tradyo is piggybacking on the idea that smartphones are going to change the way consumers actually use Craigslist. In fact, the startup compares itself to a StumbleUpon for tangible goods. The app is currently available for San Francisco and Toronto.Tradyo is a part of Israeli American startup incubator UpWest Labs.
