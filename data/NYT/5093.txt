Manila residents waded through waist-deep floodwaters on Tuesday as Typhoon Nesat struck the Philippines, killing at least 20 people and sending waves crashing over seawalls. Most of the deaths occurred in Manila, which had already been soaked by heavy monsoon rains. Pounding rain and wind gusts of up to 93 miles an hour caused the worst flooding in decades in areas along Manila Bay, and the police evacuated thousands of people. The typhoon blew out of the Philippines on Wednesday and was expected to make landfall on China&rsquo;s Hainan Island. The flooding occurred a day after Manila, a city of 12 million, held two-year commemorations for the nearly 500 people killed in a cyclone in 2009.
