KINSHASA, Democratic Republic of Congo (AP) &mdash; A passenger plane crashed in a thunderstorm as it was trying to land in Kisangani, Congo, on Friday, killing at least 48 people.        

The authorities said 53 passengers survived and that at least a dozen people were trapped in the wreckage.        

&ldquo;I confirm the crash of one of our planes,&rdquo; Stavros Papaioannou, the chairman and chief executive of Hewa Bora Airways, said in a telephone interview. &ldquo;There are already 46 bodies at the morgue, and another two that just died in the hospital.&rdquo;        

The plane had departed from Kinshasa, the capital, and was bound for Kisangani in the northeastern part of the country.        

A government spokesman, Lambert Mende, said the plane went down in bad weather a few yards from the Kisangani airport. &ldquo;It was due to the thunder,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There are around 50 dead and 53 survivors, as well as a dozen people still unaccounted for.&rdquo;        

Hewa Bora, which means &ldquo;Fresh Air&rdquo; in Swahili, has a history of crashes. In April 2008, one of the airline&rsquo;s DC-9s rammed into a bustling market after failing to lift off from the airport in Goma, Congo, killing at least 40 people &mdash; most of them on the ground.        

A few months later, a Hewa Bora plane carrying 17 people went down in bad weather, killing everyone on board.        

Congo has one of the world&rsquo;s worst air safety records. After decades of war and corrupt governments, the country has few decent roads, which forces the country&rsquo;s deeply impoverished people to rely on ill-maintained planes and boats for transportation.
