A man who confessed to executing 60 people while working for the drug gang La Familia has told the police that he was originally recruited for the job by the mayor of the small town where he lives, the authorities said. The police in Mexico State, near Mexico City, arrested the former mayor of Tlalmanalco, Ra&uacute;l S&aacute;nchez Reyes, who left office in 2009, at his house on Monday. Rodolfo Aboytes, the man who confessed to the killings and who was arrested Saturday, told the police that his cell paid off the local and state police to avoid arrest, and described six sites where he had buried bodies.
