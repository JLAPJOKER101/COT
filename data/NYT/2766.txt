MOSCOW &mdash; Gayne C. Young, a high school English teacher from Fredericksburg, Tex., is not a specialist in foreign policy. The blog he writes for Outdoor Life, a magazine for hunters and fishermen, focuses on subjects like his Labrador puppy, unusually large carp and a subdivision near his home that has been overrun by feral hogs.        

Nonetheless, last week Mr. Young scored a journalistic coup, publishing a lengthy written interview with Russia&rsquo;s prime minister, Vladimir V. Putin. Mr. Young approached the Russian government last year after blogging repeatedly about his &ldquo;man crush&rdquo; on Mr. Putin, and the questions he sent the Russian prime minister were, shall we say, softballs. They included, &ldquo;Are there Yetis or Russian &lsquo;wood goblins&rsquo; in the taiga?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Are you the coolest man in politics?&rdquo;        

The decision to grant the interview appears to be part of an attempt by Mr. Putin to soften his image in the West. During the three years since Mr. Putin entered a power-sharing arrangement with President Dmitri A. Medvedev, the president has been cast as the smiling face of a &ldquo;reset&rdquo; in the relations with the United States. In the eyes of Western observers, that has left Mr. Putin as the bad cop, which could pose a problem if he decides to return to the presidency next spring.        

&ldquo;There is some truth in this argument, and I think Putin has realized he needs to care about his image in the West,&rdquo; said Alexander Rahr, a Russia specialist at the German Council on Foreign Relations. &ldquo;The only argument which really speaks for Medvedev is this Western thing. That is his trump card. Putin has to counter it.&rdquo;        

The Outdoor Life interview &mdash; at times an exercise in mutual back-slapping &mdash; is not likely to have much impact, especially since it was released the same day as a much-anticipated news conference by Mr. Medvedev.        

But it does show Mr. Putin trying to present himself in a softer, more friendly light. In between discussions of tiger poaching, Ernest Hemingway and the fragility of human existence, Mr. Putin tells Mr. Young that the United States and Russia have been powerfully drawn to each other since the collapse of the Soviet Union.        

The recent improvement in relations &ldquo;seems to point to the fact that the vast majority of barriers between our peoples were unnaturally and artificially forced upon them,&rdquo; Mr. Putin said. &ldquo;Ordinary people always want to live in peace rather than in war and to be able to freely socialize, interact and make friends, if you wish. For too long, we had been cruelly held apart from each other, so it was only natural that the fall of the Iron Curtain generated a huge wave of interest toward Russia.&rdquo;        

Mr. Putin also plays up his image as an avatar of manliness, which has been established by photos of him riding shirtless on horseback, shooting a tiger with a tranquilizer gun or offering judo instructions. Asked about an episode last summer, when he shot a dart at the exposed back of a gray whale from a rubber dinghy, Mr. Putin drifted into Hemingway territory.        

&ldquo;All that surrounded me &mdash; the low sky, the stormy sea and, of course, the whales &mdash; was magnificent,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Besides, these elegant giants showed us a real performance, leaping out of the water in front of our boat.&rdquo;        

On that occasion, a reporter asked Mr. Putin whether it was dangerous, and the prime minister responded, &ldquo;Living in general is dangerous.&rdquo; In the Outdoor Life interview, he elaborated, saying that a human being is &ldquo;still one of the most vulnerable creatures on earth,&rdquo; barraged by disease, disaster and criminality.        

&ldquo;However, this is not a reason to hide away from life,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;One can truly enjoy his or her life only while experiencing it, and it is inevitably related to a certain level of risk.&rdquo;        

It was the gray whale episode that especially captivated Mr. Young, 42. After he began writing about his &ldquo;man crush,&rdquo; his blog hits grew so high that his editors asked him for more, and he published an open letter to the prime minister proposing that the two men go hunting together.        

Before long, Mr. Young was communicating with the press attach&eacute; in the Russian Embassy in Washington and with Ketchum, a public relations firm that represents Russia.        

&ldquo;My editors were like, &lsquo;Yeah, yeah, yeah,&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; Mr. Young said. But early in the spring, he was told that Mr. Putin was in the process of answering Mr. Young&rsquo;s questions &mdash; at considerable length. The draft originally sent to Outdoor Life was almost 8,000 words long and had to be edited down by almost 3,000 words, Mr. Young said.        

&ldquo;I got to tell you, I&rsquo;m more in love with the guy than ever,&rdquo; he said. In an interview from his home in Texas, Mr. Young said Outdoor Life was hoping to send him to Russia to go fishing with Mr. Putin, who is not a keen hunter. It seemed Mr. Young&rsquo;s ardor does not extend to Mr. Medvedev, since a mention of the Russian president&rsquo;s name was met with silence on the other end of the line.        

&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to have to remind me who that is,&rdquo; Mr. Young said.
