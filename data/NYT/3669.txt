ISLAMABAD, Pakistan &mdash; The Pakistani government issued an angry denunciation on Friday of the statement by the Obama administration&rsquo;s top military official that the killing of a Pakistani journalist was sanctioned by the nation&rsquo;s authorities.        

The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. Mike Mullen, told reporters in Washington on Thursday that he had seen nothing to disabuse a report this week that the &ldquo;government knew about this.&rdquo;        

In response, Pakistan&rsquo;s minister of information, Firdous Ashiq Awan, said that Admiral Mullen had made an &ldquo;extremely irresponsible and unfortunate statement.&rdquo;        

&ldquo;This statement will create problems and difficulties for the bilateral relations between Pakistan and America,&rdquo; Ms. Awan said. &ldquo;It will definitely deal a blow to our common efforts with regard to the war on terror.&rdquo;        

In an article on Tuesday, The New York Times said the Obama administration believed that Pakistan&rsquo;s powerful spy agency, the Directorate for Inter-Services Intelligence, or ISI, had directed the murder of Saleem Shahzad, a reporter who wrote about the infiltration of militants in the Pakistan army.        

Admiral Mullen, who is retiring in several weeks, told a group of reporters at the Pentagon on Thursday: &ldquo;I have not seen anything to disabuse the report that the government knew about this.&rdquo; He added: &ldquo;I would not be able to walk in and say, you know, here&rsquo;s the string of evidence I have to confirm it.&rdquo;        

But Admiral Mullen suggested that the killing would not help relations between the United States and Pakistan. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a way to move ahead,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a way to continue to, quite frankly, spiral in the wrong direction.&rdquo;        

The body of Mr. Shahzad, who wrote for the Web site Asia Times Online, was found two days after he disappeared from Islamabad on May 29.        

The ISI has denied it was involved in the killing. Immediately after the discovery of the journalist&rsquo;s body, with 17 wounds that were, according to an autopsy report, inflicted with a blunt instrument, several journalists and human rights activists said the spy agency was the prime suspect.        

Under pressure from Pakistani journalists, the civilian government established a commission of investigation to look into the murder. Its findings are expected early next month.
