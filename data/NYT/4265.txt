The government appointed an independent commission on Friday to investigate the attacks that killed at least 77 people last month at a government building in Oslo and an island youth camp. Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg said the nine-member team was to find out &ldquo;the plain truth&rdquo; about what happened so that &ldquo;it would never happen again.&rdquo; The appointment of the commission came after criticism that the police took too long to arrive on the island and that government buildings were not well protected.
