BEIJING &mdash; Chinese railway officials blame &ldquo;serious design flaws&rdquo; in railroad signaling equipment for the high-speed train crash in eastern China that left 39 people dead and 192 people injured on Saturday, the official news agency Xinhua reported Thursday.        

The signaling device at the Wenzhou South railway station malfunctioned after it was struck by lightning and failed to turn from green to red, An Lusheng, chief of the Shanghai Railway Bureau, told the news agency.        

Mr. An also said that the workers on duty were inadequately trained and had failed to notice or fix the malfunction.        

Xinhua&rsquo;s report, the first official explanation of the cause of the crash, raises further questions about the safety of China&rsquo;s high-speed rail system, one of the world&rsquo;s largest and most costly public works projects. The accident occurred when one high speed train rear-ended another train near Wenzhou in Zhejiang Province.        

Some experts have suggested that China might be building its system too quickly, without enough attention to safety.&nbsp;High-speed rail has an excellent safety record in Europe and Japan.        

He Jinliang, director of the China Standardization Association of Lightning Protection Technology, said in an interview that while it was not necessarily cost-effective to make rail equipment &ldquo;100 percent lightning-proof, you can definitely prevent this kind of serious accident.&rdquo;        

He called for further investigation into how the high-speed rail project has been protected from lightning strikes.
