JOHANNESBURG &mdash; In a rare upset for President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, the country&rsquo;s Parliament on Tuesday decisively re-elected one of his political opponents to serve as its speaker.        

Lovemore Moyo, of the Movement for Democratic Change, or M.D.C., had been elected in 2008, but his victory was invalidated three weeks ago on a legal technicality.        

&ldquo;When they announced the results, we shouted with joy; we raised our speaker high, and we sang,&rdquo; Jameson Timba, a senior adviser to Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai, leader of the Movement for Democratic Change, said Tuesday.        

Leaders of the movement contended that Mr. Mugabe&rsquo;s party, ZANU-PF, in power for 31 years, had tried to bribe five rival lawmakers with $5,000 each to cast a secret ballot for ZANU-PF&rsquo;s candidate, Simon Khaya Moyo. But instead of pocketing the money, the lawmakers turned it in, the leaders said.        

ZANU-PF denied the charge. &ldquo;If we had bribed the people, how would we have lost?&rdquo; said a ZANU-PF spokesman, Rugare Gumbo. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not true.&rdquo;        

Earlier that day, Mr. Mugabe&rsquo;s spokesman, George Charamba, said that it was impossible to know who would win the bitterly contested secret vote.        

&ldquo;Neither party can predict the outcome,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It presents headaches for both leaders.&rdquo;        

The M.D.C. candidate won by a vote of 105 to 93, picking up 2 or 3 ZANU-PF votes and carrying a smaller breakaway faction of its own party that had threatened to abstain.        

In recent weeks, police officers and prosecutors under the control of Mr. Mugabe&rsquo;s party have arrested some of their rivals&rsquo; most influential leaders in Parliament, in moves that M.D.C. officials said were intended to whittle away their majority before the vote on a speaker.        

On Tuesday, Elton Mangoma, an M.D.C. minister of energy who negotiated the deal that led to the power-sharing government of the M.D.C. and ZANU-PF, remained in jail in Harare on corruption charges and was not able to vote for speaker. A judge hearing his bail application recently described the state&rsquo;s case as weak and said accusations that Mr. Mangoma had been involved in a crooked fuel contract may have been an effort to provide a solution to an emergency fuel shortage, rather than to profit himself.        

Mr. Mangoma was taken to court this week with his healthy leg shackled to one withered by childhood polio. At the judge&rsquo;s insistence, prison officials removed the chains.        

Theresa Makone, a member of the M.D.C. who is co-minister of home affairs, which is supposed to oversee the police, was in hiding on Monday after receiving an anonymous tip on her cellphone that she faced arrest on charges of fomenting violence.        

In a cellphone interview from an undisclosed location on Monday, she dismissed the charges as &ldquo;ridiculous&rdquo; but said she had &ldquo;gone below the radar&rdquo; to make sure she was not taken into custody.        

&ldquo;I want to vote for speaker,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;They can get ahold of me after I&rsquo;ve voted.&rdquo;        

On Tuesday evening, Mrs. Makone said that she had taken a chance and cast her ballot for speaker, but that she had returned to her hide-out &ldquo;just for the time being.&rdquo;        

&ldquo;Now that I&rsquo;ve voted, I don&rsquo;t think it matters to them anymore,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m still a free woman. I will go to my office tomorrow at 9 o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;
