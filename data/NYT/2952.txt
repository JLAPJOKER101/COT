SANTIAGO, Chile &ndash; A newly disclosed military legal file has cast fresh doubt on whether former President Salvador Allende, who died during the September 11, 1973 military coup, committed suicide, as the official version and his own family have always claimed.        

The file, which was reported by a program on state television Monday night, contains a military court&rsquo;s investigation at the time with evidence that Mr. Allende may have been shot from a small firearm before he shot himself with a machine gun from under his chin, as witnesses in the presidential palace have testified for almost 40 years.        

A fingerprint analysis of the machine gun that Mr. Allende presumably used to take his own life found no prints on the weapon. Several people interviewed for the program and who had been with Mr. Allende in the presidential palace that day provided contradictory testimony on whether he was alone when he died. The three men who were said to have been with him at the time of the shooting were arrested that day and then disappeared.        

Senator Isabel Allende, the former president&rsquo;s daughter, stated that the program was &ldquo;an insult to scientific intelligence.&rdquo;        

&ldquo;We are searching for the truth ... but we want that truth to be based on scientific proof, not on journalistic imagination, not on irresponsibility,&rdquo; she said.        

Judge Mario Carroza has been investigating the cause of Mr. Allende&rsquo;s death since January. His remains were exhumed on May 23 and a team of Chilean and foreign forensics experts are expected to issue their conclusions within 90 days.
