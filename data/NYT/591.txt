Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday canceled the appointment of Maj. Gen. Yoav Galant, left, as the Israeli Army&rsquo;s incoming chief of staff. General Galant was supposed to take over from Lt. Gen. Gabi Ashkenazi in mid-February but his nomination has been challenged in court over accusations that he illegally took over land around his home in a village in northern Israel. Israel&rsquo;s state comptroller said that General Galant lied in a court affidavit about the acquisition of the land. Israel&rsquo;s attorney general ruled on Tuesday that he would not be able to defend Gen. Galant&rsquo;s appointment. The Defense Ministry said in a statement that the deputy chief of staff, Maj. Gen. Yair Naveh, would assume the top post for up to 60 days.
