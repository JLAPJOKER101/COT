The lawyer for the captured American fugitive George Wright filed arguments on Thursday against his extradition to the United States, telling a Lisbon court that Mr. Wright should be allowed to serve the rest of his sentence in Portugal. The United States is trying to extradite Mr. Wright, above in a 2000 photo, to serve the rest of his 15- to 30-year sentence for a 1962 murder in New Jersey. He spent seven years in prison before breaking out in 1970 and had been on the run for 41 years until his arrest in Portugal last week. His lawyer, Manuel Lu&iacute;s Ferreira, contends that Mr. Wright is now a Portuguese citizen and should be allowed to serve the remainder of his sentence in Portugal, where his wife and two grown children live.
