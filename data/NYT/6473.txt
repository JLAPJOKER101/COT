Israeli authorities reopened a wooden bridge used by non-Muslims to enter the holy compound known as the Noble Sanctuary to Muslims and the Temple Mount to Jews. The Israelis closed the bridge on Monday because they considered it unsafe and wanted to replace it. But any act around the holy compound produces suspicion, and Palestinian and Jordanian officials fiercely objected. The Israelis said they would reinforce the bridge rather than rebuild it.
