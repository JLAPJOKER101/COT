PARIS &mdash; As if the life of Nicolas Sarkozy has not produced enough melodrama &mdash; especially with rumors now that his third wife, Carla Bruni-Sarkozy, may be pregnant &mdash; French moviemakers have produced a semifictional drama, called &ldquo;La Conqu&ecirc;te,&rdquo; or &ldquo;The Conquest,&rdquo; that purports to take us behind the scenes of his rise to power.        

&ldquo;The story of a man who wins power and loses his wife,&rdquo; is the tag line, a neat summary of the relentless Mr. Sarkozy&rsquo;s 2007 campaign to succeed Jacques Chirac even as his second wife, C&eacute;cilia, falls in love with another man but returns to pretend all is normal until the final vote is cast &mdash; and then disappears.        

The tale is meant to be Shakespearean, a drama of flawed, ambitious men and romantic, calculating women, a delineation behind the curtains of political scheming, betrayal, personal loss and the price of power. But it is also the story of a serving president, a sharp break with more reverential French tradition.        

The models for the film, said the producer, Eric Altmayer, were Anglo-Saxon &mdash; &ldquo;The Candidate,&rdquo; &ldquo;Bob Roberts,&rdquo; &ldquo;All the President&rsquo;s Men,&rdquo; &ldquo;Primary Colors&rdquo; and, of course, &ldquo;The Queen,&rdquo; the depiction of the British monarch&rsquo;s struggle with Diana, Princess of Wales, and her death. The director, Xavier Durringer, has worked hard for verisimilitude, he insists, not for caricature or satire.        

&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a political film, but it&rsquo;s about politics,&rdquo; Mr. Durringer said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a film about Sarkozy himself, but about the conquest of power.&rdquo;        

Mr. Altmayer said: &ldquo;We tried to stay as objective as possible. We tried to come close to him, his vulnerability and contradictions, his good and bad.&rdquo;        

And who knows? &ldquo;La Conqu&ecirc;te&rdquo; may actually be very good. But no one will know until it opens at the Cannes Film Festival next Wednesday; it will be released nationally the same day. Until then, there is merely a trailer. No advance copies have been released to critics, journalists or even, the director and producer say, to Mr. Sarkozy and his entourage.        

Film is important to Mr. Sarkozy, who likes to tell visitors about the great classic films he has seen, as well as the books he has read. This fascination with the classics comes from Ms. Bruni-Sarkozy, who has put her husband through a kind of &Eacute;lys&eacute;e tutorial, including lunches with writers and artists. He told one group that he and Ms. Bruni-Sarkozy watched 150 movies a year.        

He is particularly fond of American films, personally pinning a high rank of the Legion of Honor on Clint Eastwood and giving a disquisition about his love of Mr. Eastwood&rsquo;s directness and simplicity, contrasting it to the bourgeois, talky complexities of the average French film.        

Mr. Sarkozy, who is at a low in the opinion polls a year before elections, may not like this film, however. The poster shows a besuited figure, cut off at the shoulders, sitting on a very high stool, his little legs dangling.        

The actor who plays him, Denis Podalyd&egrave;s, known for his work in the theater, wears a curly wig, but otherwise impersonates Mr. Sarkozy through his twitches, mannerisms and gestures. Mr. Podalyd&egrave;s and Mr. Durringer say that they studied thousands of photographs and hours of film footage, read hundreds of articles and spoke to political journalists. The actor had a short meeting with the president, who told him, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like power, but I like exercising it.&rdquo;        

But the film clearly includes fictional moments, especially of intimate conversations, as Mr. Sarkozy tries to persuade C&eacute;cilia, his second wife, not to leave him.        

The trailer shows one scene of Mr. Sarkozy storming out of a political meeting saying: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a Ferrari. You open the hood with white gloves on.&rdquo; At another point in the trailer he yells, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m surrounded by jerks!&rdquo; In general, the film has him speak, in private, in a tough, vulgar slang. Another character calls him mad, and the actor playing Mr. Chirac pretends to shoot Mr. Sarkozy with an imaginary rifle.        

Pierre Charon, a former press adviser to Mr. Sarkozy, said, &ldquo;What we have seen, we do not like at all.&rdquo; And other unnamed advisers are quoted in the French press as describing the film, which they have not seen, as &ldquo;a ridiculous caricature.&rdquo; Mr. Podalyd&egrave;s wrote Mr. Sarkozy a handwritten letter explaining his role.        

Even Dominique de Villepin, Mr. Chirac&rsquo;s favorite and Mr. Sarkozy&rsquo;s rival for the 2007 nomination, dismisses the film as fiction. Of course, Mr. de Villepin is already the subject of some mockery in a popular comic novel, &ldquo;Quai d&rsquo;Orsay,&rdquo; about his time as Mr. Chirac&rsquo;s poetry-composing, Napoleon-enamored foreign minister, here known as Alexandre Taillard de Vorms.
