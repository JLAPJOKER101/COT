Mortar shells killed up to 30 people on Thursday in a neighborhood of Abidjan that is loyal to Alassane Ouattara, the internationally recognized winner of the presidential election, the United Nations said. Witnesses said the shells were fired from a military police base into a market in the Abobo district, which is held by fighters loyal to Mr. Ouattara. Earlier in the day, pro-Ouattara fighters ambushed a police station in the Adjame district of Abidjan.
