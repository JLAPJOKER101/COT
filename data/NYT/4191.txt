Nine former soldiers and officials have turned themselves in to a court in El Salvador after being indicted in Spain for the 1989 massacre of six Jesuit priests, their housekeeper and her daughter in San Salvador. The Supreme Court now has 45 days to decide whether to extradite the men to Spain. American officials and analysts, however, say an extradition is unlikely. The court is expected to rely on Salvadoran law, including a 1993 amnesty for crimes committed during its civil war.
