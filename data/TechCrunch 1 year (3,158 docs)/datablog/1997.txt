After notching a spot on the NASDAQ, TripAdvisors Stephen Kaufer carved out a few minutes for Founder Stories, with host, Chris Dixon. In episode II of this interview, the two discuss their mutual disdain for the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) and Kaufer offers advice to founders.Highlighting a piece of advice, Kaufer tells Dixon a good way for a consumer facing, web-based business to capture what your visitors really want is to run a live test with a non-working link. Calling these 404-tests he says before you build the darn thing  see how many people click it. It goes nowhere, it says broken link to the user [but] your log file says how many people checked it out.While the marketing department may not love the practice, Kaufer says it solves umpteen meetings worth of powerful debate and logical arguments.More advice follows  be sure to hear it all by watching the entire interview and watch episode I of this interview here.If you missed a past episode of Founder Stories, you can get caught-up here. Guests include leaders from BirchBox, Foodspotting, GroupMe, DropBox, Tumblr and KickStarter.
