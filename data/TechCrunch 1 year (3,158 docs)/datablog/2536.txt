What a week Sencha is having. Just minutes ago, they announced their new HTML 5 cloud services suite, Sencha.io. Tomorrow morning, the company will announce theyve raised a $15 million Series B.The announcement will be made during tomorrows keynote of their third annual Senchacon.So, whats a Sencha? Sencha makes Javascript frameworks and tools for HTML 5 developers. In other words, they make life easier for the people trying to make the web prettier. Sencha Touch, for example, lets developers quickly add Native app-esque touch gestures to their web apps; Sencha Animator, meanwhile, lets developers build complex CSS3 animations in the same way as they might build a Flash animation. Its also a type of green tea (specifically, its green tea made without first grinding the leaves.)This round was led by Jafco Venture, with existing investors Sequoia Capital and Radar Partners participating as well. Sancha previously raised $14 million in their Series A back in June of 2010.
