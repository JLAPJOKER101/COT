KAMPALA, Uganda &mdash; A leading official of the government of the secessionist region of southern Sudan was shot dead by his brother-in-law on Wednesday morning, according to officials who said the motive was personal and unrelated to the region&rsquo;s recent vote for independence.        

The official who was killed, Jimmy Lemi, was southern Sudan&rsquo;s minister for rural development and cooperatives. The officials said his brother-in-law, Emmanuel Luga, had recently been replaced as Mr. Lemi&rsquo;s driver. They said Mr. Luga stormed Mr. Lemi&rsquo;s office and opened fire, killing Mr. Lemi and a security guard before he was arrested.        

Benjamin Marial, the minister of information, said Mr. Luga had been fired as a driver because his behavior was &ldquo;erratic and rude.&rdquo; For several months before the shooting, he had been campaigning with Mr. Lemi but had yet to be paid, the information minister said, speculating that this might be a motive for the killing.
