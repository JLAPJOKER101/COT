Never mind that this is clearly an ad agency video; its clever. And smart. After all Huawei has big plans for the U.S. market.Were not known to the general public, James Jiang, vice president of product and marketing for Huawei, said at CTIA last October. Were taking the initiative to build a name for us. The Chinese mobile company is a major supplier of white label cell phones with a major chunk of its products co-branded by a wireless carrier or 3rd party. But speaking at CTIA, Jiang revealed Huawei plans on being a top 5 mobile brand in the U.S within the next three years. That would put Huawei among the likes of Samsung, LG, Apple, Motorola, and HTC  an impressive goal to say the least.Huawei is making moves towards this objective, too. Its latest hardware is impressive even if its not yet headed to U.S. stores. Whats more, the company recently announced plans to move its North American R&D headquarters from Plano, Texas to Santa Clara, Calif. and add 500 new employees to its workforce. Setting up shop in the heart of Silicon Valley says Huawei is ready to compete, but its equally important to make sure U.S. citizens know how to say the companys name. Its wah-way, in case you were wondering.
