AnyMeeting, the free web conferencing service all your online meeting and conference needs, is today launching a redesign of its user interface, which brings the service an upgraded interface that makes it even easier to meet with your colleagues without actually having to see them in person. If that doesnt get you excited, I dont know what will.The company has also added a simultaneous video chat and broadcasting feature  a la Google+ Hangouts  that allows up to six participants to talk to each other and collaborate in realtime as they plan their takeover of the world. The updates also include faster screen sharing and a cleaner in-meeting experience with improved screen management and web conferencing functions all offered in an easily-accessible menu bar.The SaaS meeting and conference service, which was launched in late 2009, allows users to host meetings of up to 200 attendees with no time limits, screen sharing, app sharing, recording, and social media integration. The company is really targeting small businesses and independent professionals looking to offer how-to videos, demonstrations, or host panels and seminars. (Vokle is another cool company in the space offering similar functionality.)The company has raised seed capital from investors that include Tech Coast Angels, Pasadena Angels, and Maverick Angels. In August, the AnyMeeting added PayPal integration to allow anyone with a verified PayPal Merchant account to sell tickets to both live and recorded webinars. The feature is integrated into the startups webinar system in hopes of making monetization simple for its users  all they have to do is set their ticket price (or offer discount codes) and viewers can pay using their credit card or PayPal account. The funds go directly to the AnyMeeting users that scheduled the seminar, at which point the service deducts a small fee for each ticket purchased.A small service charge, along with some non-intrusive advertising and strategic partnerships, are how the startup plans to make money.I had a chance to take the video-conferencing tool for a spin, and it worked smoothly, all from within my browser. Its a great little tool for startups, so check it out.For more on AnyMeeting, check em out at home here.
