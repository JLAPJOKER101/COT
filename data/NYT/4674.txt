Several hundred Haitians demonstrated in Port-Salut on Monday in support of an 18-year-old man who said he was sexually assaulted by peacekeepers from Uruguay on a United Nations base. The episode occurred July 20, but only became public last week when a video taken by cellphone was circulated and the United Nations announced an investigation. The Uruguayan military has said it was a prank that got out of hand. Late Sunday, President Michel Martelly of Haiti called it an &ldquo;act that revolts the national conscience.&rdquo; The protesters in Port-Salut called for reparations.
