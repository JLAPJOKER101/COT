Former President Leonid D. Kuchma was officially charged Thursday in connection with the murder of a prominent investigative journalist. Though the precise nature of the charges remains unclear, prosecutors announced this week that Mr. Kuchma was suspected of ordering the 2000 murder of the journalist, Georgy Gongadze. Mr. Kuchma, whose decade as president was known for widespread corruption and political violence, could be sentenced to up to 12 years in prison if convicted, the Ukrainian media reported. Earlier, he said he was prepared to &ldquo;go through all the tortures of hell&rdquo; to prove his innocence.
