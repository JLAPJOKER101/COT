Video search company Blinkx will be adding tens of thousands of clips from various feature films to its search engine, thanks to a deal with startup AnyClip. The agreement should bolster the amount of content Blinkx users will be able to access, as well as monetization for both companies and the studios who provide their videos to AnyClip.AnyClip has more than 50,000 video clips from 12,000 different feature films, which come from studios such as Warner Bros, Universal Studios, Vivendi, First Look and Virgil Films. The startup takes those films, breaks them down into clips, and tags them with advanced metadata, allowing users to search based on the actors included in a scene, snippets of dialogue, and the like.Through this distribution agreement, AnyClip will make those clips available for search as part of its Blinkxs video platform. Blinkx now claims some 35 million hours of video content available through its site, and gets about 100 million uniques per month, according to comScore. The agreement is a rev-share deal, according to AnyClip CEO Oren Nauman, through which AnyClip and Blinkx will share advertising revenue with the studios that theyve licensed the clips from.AnyClip has been ramping up both licensing and distribution since getting a redesign and announcing its focus on the B2B market last year. Last fall it signed up Warner Bros for movies from the Batman and Harry Potter franchises, as well as Oceanâ€™s Eleven, 300, Superman, and others. AnyClip also struck a distribution deal with Dailymotion to make those films available on its video portal.While AnyClip was a bit slow to hit its stride, Nauman says the startup now is getting millions of video viewers daily. With both content and distribution growing, AnyClip is considering raising more funding. The startup, which is backed by Jerusalem Venture Partners, has 35 employees based in offices in New York City, Los Angeles and Jerusalem.
