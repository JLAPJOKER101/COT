OMGPOPs Draw Something drawing game just surpassed 50 million downloads. It has been downloaded around a million times a day since launch. The paid version is currently number one in the App Store.The company also noted that over 6 billion drawings have been passed between friends. According to the PR, the least popular word to draw is latrine, which is understandable.Zygna recently bought OMGPOP for a cool $210 million and most of the team  except for one employee who was unceremoniously insulted by the CEO on Twitter  are now working in the bowels of FarmVille-land.As a point of comparison, Angry Birds Space was downloaded 10 million times in three days, a strong showing for another popular casual game.
