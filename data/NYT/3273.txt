There will be no criminal proceedings against a soldier who posted Facebook photographs of herself with bound and blindfolded Palestinian prisoners, Israel&rsquo;s Justice Ministry said on Friday. The soldier, Eden Aberjil, posted the photos last summer, provoking criticism of the military. The ministry said the soldier&rsquo;s actions were &ldquo;unacceptable,&rdquo; but not criminal. A ministry spokesman said that two other soldiers who posted photos with prisoners would face criminal proceedings.
