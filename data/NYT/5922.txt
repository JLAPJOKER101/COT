HONOLULU &mdash; President Obama promised to continue &ldquo;a frank dialogue&rdquo; on economic disputes with China as he met with its president, Hu Jintao, on the sidelines of a trade summit here on Saturday. But, he added, &ldquo;We should be rooting for China to grow.&rdquo;        

As millions of Chinese emerge from poverty, &ldquo;those are potential customers for us in the future,&rdquo; Mr. Obama told a business group before the leaders met. He was addressing an issue that is certain to be part of the political debate as he seeks re-election; Republican presidential candidates have made China-bashing a prominent part of their critique of Mr. Obama&rsquo;s economic record.        

Mr. Hu, speaking to reporters as he and Mr. Obama were about to go behind closed doors, said that &ldquo;growing instability and uncertainty in the world economic recovery&rdquo; makes it all the more essential that China and the United States cooperate.        

Security concerns also came up in their meeting and in Mr. Obama&rsquo;s separate huddle with President Dmitry A. Medvedev of Russia &mdash; in particular, Iran&rsquo;s nuclear program, where the United States has sought to enlist the two powers to pressure Iran.        

Mr. Obama&rsquo;s meetings with the leaders of China, Russia and Japan came after the announcement that he and the leaders of eight other Pacific Rim nations had agreed to the outline of a Trans-Pacific Partnership to lower barriers to trade and investment and pledged to complete it in 2012.        

While the group does not include China or Japan, Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda told Mr. Obama in their private meeting that Japan would join the negotiations, the White House said. The other nations are Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia, Brunei, Singapore, Vietnam, Chile and Peru. The Asian nations among them look to such alliances with the United States to offset China&rsquo;s muscle, which explains China&rsquo;s wariness.        

Mr. Obama said the partnership, like the recently approved free-trade pact with South Korea, &ldquo;will also help achieve my goal of doubling U.S. exports, which support millions of American jobs.&rdquo; He called it a model for future pacts because &ldquo;it addresses a whole range of issues not covered by past agreements&rdquo; like workers&rsquo; and environmental rights.        

Michael Froman, administration adviser for international economic affairs, said the group still could have a final agreement with Japan in the mix. But he noted a &ldquo;long history of trade issues with Japan&rdquo; &mdash; before China&rsquo;s rise, Japan was the object of anti-trade sentiments in the United States. Mr. Obama told Mr. Noda that Japan would have to open its agriculture, services and manufacturing markets, officials said.        

Mr. Froman, responding to reports that China has complained about not being invited to the group&rsquo;s negotiations, said the partnership &ldquo;is not something that one gets invited to. It&rsquo;s something that one aspires to&rdquo; &mdash; if they can meet the standards for free and fair trade.        

Trade talk among the Pacific Rim leaders is to continue on Sunday with the main event, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum representing 21 economies. Mr. Obama, as host, has sought to use the summit to symbolize the primacy of Asia and the Pacific region for United States foreign policy after a decade in which war in the Middle East has dominated. Yet Europe&rsquo;s debt crisis intruded as a subject of discussion, officials said.        

At a session with executives whose companies operate in Asia, Jim McNerney, the chief executive of Boeing and the leader of Mr. Obama&rsquo;s exports advisory council, said Asians have expressed concern to American business executives that the United States does not treat the region as a priority.        

&ldquo;The United States is a Pacific power, and we are here to stay,&rdquo; Mr. Obama said.        

&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to be going through some tough fiscal positions back home,&rdquo; he added, reflecting awareness of some Asian nations&rsquo; concern that budget-cutting could reduce the United States&rsquo; ability to be a military counterweight to China. But, he said, Asia &ldquo;has to remain a top priority&rdquo; because it is &ldquo;the fastest-growing region in the world.&rdquo;        

The separate appearances of Mr. Obama and Mr. Hu&nbsp; at the executives&rsquo; forum offered a hint of their later private meeting.        

Mr. Obama said China must &ldquo;play by the rules,&rdquo; and he cited its undervalued currency, which makes American exports more expensive in China, and violations of American companies&rsquo; intellectual property rights as continuing headaches. For China to fail to protect those companies&rsquo; patents, copyrights and innovations &ldquo;is not acceptable.&rdquo;        

Mr. Hu said, &ldquo;China takes protecting intellectual property rights seriously.&rdquo; In remarks that largely were a pitch to businesses to invest in China, he said his nation&rsquo;s goal was to improve its capacity to innovate so that its economy is redefined &ldquo;from &lsquo;Made in China&rsquo; to &lsquo;Created by China.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;
