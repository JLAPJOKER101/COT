Recognizable, fast-loading, but outdated as hell website seeks Senior UI / Usability / Front End Engineer. Love it or hate it, Craigslists design could provide a better experience, and apparently Craig thinks so too, as this weekend the site posted a job opening for someone to make it faster, friendlier, and easier. Its hoping for a brave designer who can develop new products and features that will have CL users swooning, optimize internal team tools, and who has mobile app design and platform support skills.Theres plenty of tweaks wed appreciate like more consistent navigation controls and better use of whitespace. But dont expect Craigslist to ditch itsÂ famously minimal facade thats helped it climb to 50 million classified postings and 30 billion page views a month.Its been almost two years since Craigslist made any significant change to its interface, and even that was subtle. The site has looked largely the same for a decade now. While its massive community and network effect protect it from disruption, task marketplaces like Zaarly and lodging locators like Airbnb are starting to nip at its heels. Maybe its finally time give the site a little polish, even if the text-heavy look remains.Weve reached out to founder Craig Newmark for details about what the usability engineer would be working on.
