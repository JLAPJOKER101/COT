Joseph Kabila was sworn in on Tuesday for a new term as president after his victory last month in a disputed election that was marred by deadly violence and allegations of fraud. At the ceremony, held in a heavily guarded compound in the capital, Kinshasa, Mr. Kabila, left, promised to improve the country&rsquo;s business climate and rebuild infrastructure. Mr. Kabila has been in power since his father&rsquo;s assassination in 2001. But the leading opposition figure, &Eacute;tienne Tshisekedi, who has rejected Mr. Kabila&rsquo;s re-election and declared himself president, is planning his own inauguration on Friday, raising fears of renewed street violence in Kinshasa, where he is popular. The city was mostly quiet on Tuesday, with riot wagons and security forces cruising through the streets.
