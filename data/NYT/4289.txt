BEERSHEBA, Israel &mdash; As Israel&rsquo;s social protest movement spread beyond Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday tempered a promise to find &ldquo;concrete solutions&rdquo; to demonstrators&rsquo; concerns with a warning that the global financial crisis precluded quick change.        



&ldquo;We know one thing: We want to find solutions that are economically sound,&rdquo; he said at the weekly cabinet meeting. &ldquo;For if we end up bankrupt or face economic collapse, a reality in which some of Europe&rsquo;s leading economies find themselves in today, we will solve neither the economic problems nor the social ones.&rdquo;        

Mr. Netanyahu&rsquo;s remarks came the morning after roughly 30,000 protesters gathered in the northern port city of Haifa, more than 10,000 in southern Beersheba, and thousands more in smaller gatherings in Netanya, Afula, Ashkelon, Nahariya and other towns around the country.        

At a rally in Haifa, which has a large Israeli Arab population, speakers addressed the crowd in Hebrew and Arabic, with banners proclaiming &ldquo;We are Melting Down From Taxes,&rdquo; and, a common theme, &ldquo;The People Demand Social Justice.&rdquo;        

In Beersheba, protesters bused in from Tel Aviv joined families, students and uniformed scout groups who marched past police cordons to a park, chanting slogans and carrying banners reading &ldquo;Reclaim the Streets&rdquo; and &ldquo;Taxation on Wealth, and Justice for the Masses.&rdquo;        

The nationwide turnout, while much smaller than the 300,000 in Tel Aviv and elsewhere the week before, represented a deliberate attempt by organizers to broaden the impact of the month-old demonstration, which has grown from a small cluster of tent protesters to a phenomenon drawing widespread media attention.        

Although the protest straddles the traditional divide between left and right, a core complaint of some demonstrators is the spending priorities of Mr. Netanyahu&rsquo;s right-wing coalition government. They demand that it ease the gap between rich and poor and address hardships caused by a housing shortage and unaffordable rents.        

In Haifa, one woman complained about the cost of housing for her elderly mother. In Nahariya, close to the Lebanese border, slogans read &ldquo;The Periphery Demands Jobs&rdquo; and &ldquo;Youth Also Wants a Future.&rdquo; And in Beersheba, capital of the southern Negev region, a group rallied against Arab Bedouin house demolitions nearby.        

&ldquo;Until today we have had huge demonstrations in Tel Aviv, so people decided to show solidarity with other areas because the main problem is not in Tel Aviv but in other places that are not as developed,&rdquo; said Avner Beirach, 26, a Tel Aviv student who attended the rally in Beersheba.        

&ldquo;The state doesn&rsquo;t put enough money into education and infrastructure,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The budget to the military and the settlements are, in my opinion, way, way too big, and resources should be dedicated to public education, which has declined massively in the last 30 years, and to public housing.&rdquo;        

Michal Sagi-Savaryego, 38, who was born in southern Eilat and now studies in Jerusalem, said she felt uncomfortable even standing for her own national anthem.        

&ldquo;This is not the land that was promised by our grandparents&rsquo; generation,&rdquo; she said in Beersheba. &ldquo;I was maybe young and na&iuml;ve and believed that we were building a social state for all citizens. But someone has made a fortune on our backs, on our wars, on our taxes, everything.&rdquo;        

In Nahariya, Adi Gross, 27, a Haifa University student from Kibbutz Ga&rsquo;aton, predicted that the movement would not disappear. &ldquo;These protests are not going to stop before a solution is found,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Soon people are going to go back to work, and students are going to go back to schools, but when they are required to go to vote next time, they are going to think twice.&rdquo; She also singled out defense spending, saying, &ldquo;Security is important, but it is not everything.&rdquo;        

Many of the protesters in Haifa were from Israel&rsquo;s Arab population, which makes up 20 percent of the nation&rsquo;s total.        

Suhair Halabi, 30, a social worker from the Druze village of Daliyat al Karmel, addressed the crowd in fluent Hebrew. Wearing a T-shirt saying &ldquo;Marx Was Right,&rdquo; she told those gathered: &ldquo;Nobody is free until everybody is free.&rdquo;        

Switching to Arabic when speaking later off stage, she said: &ldquo;It is very important to have our voices heard. There are issues of occupation, racism and a feeling that the agenda that was set is bad for us. We are fighting a national and a class battle.&rdquo;        

Mr. Netanyahu has appointed a panel to examine options for socioeconomic change, led by Manuel Trajtenberg, an economics professor at Tel Aviv University and former head of the government&rsquo;s economic advisory council. It is to submit its conclusions to the government&rsquo;s Social and Economic Cabinet next month.        

On Sunday, Mr. Netanyahu urged &ldquo;financial responsibility alongside social sensitivity.&rdquo; At the start of the weekly cabinet meeting, he cited the constraints under which Israel must operate, particularly what he termed a &ldquo;serious spasm&rdquo; in the global economy.        

&ldquo;We are dealing here with complex issues,&rdquo; he said in remarks released by his office. &ldquo;We intend to arrive at concrete solutions, not generalizations, but rather concrete solutions to concrete problems of reducing the cost of living and the closing of gaps in the State of Israel, gaps including those between the periphery and the center.&rdquo;        

He said that the government was already presenting practical measures with an overhaul of high schools, and that it would invest about $2 billion on changes to higher education in the coming years.
