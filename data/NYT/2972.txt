MOSCOW &mdash; A jury in Vienna on Wednesday convicted three Chechen exiles in the murder of Umar S. Israilov, a bodyguard who had turned against his former employer, the Chechen leader Ramzan A. Kadyrov.        

Mr. Israilov had filed a complaint with the European Court of Human Rights against Mr. Kadyrov, who he said had participated in kidnappings, torture and killings as part of an attempt to quash Chechnya&rsquo;s separatist movement. He was shot and killed in January 2009 as he left a grocery store in Vienna.        

The jury sentenced Otto Kaltenbrunner, who is believed to have organized the shooting, to life in prison; Muslim Dadayev, who drove the getaway car, to 19 years; and Turpal Ali Yesherkayev, an accomplice, to 16 years in prison. A fourth suspect, Lecha Bogatirov, who is believed to have fired the three shots that killed Mr. Israilov, left Austria and returned to Russia after the killing, Austrian investigators said.        

The Austrian prosecutors said that they concluded that Mr. Kadyrov had ordered Mr. Israilov&rsquo;s abduction, which went awry as the men tried to snatch him on the street, but that they lacked sufficient evidence to charge him. At the time, Mr. Kadyrov denied the accusation, suggesting that the killers were trying to frame him.        

During the trial, the prosecutors clearly depicted Mr. Israilov&rsquo;s murder as a political one that had been carried out on Austrian territory, said Wenzel Michalski, the Germany director for Human Rights Watch. He said the next step should be prosecuting the gunman and mastermind behind the crime.        

&ldquo;For us, it is important that it shines light on Russia, and the fact the Russia is not really helping the authorities here in investigating the case,&rdquo; Mr. Michalski said. He described the three convicted men as &ldquo;just contract killers.&rdquo;        

&ldquo;The people behind them &mdash; the big dons &mdash; they sit somewhere in Chechnya,&rdquo; he said.
