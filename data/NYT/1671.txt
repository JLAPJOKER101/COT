WASHINGTON &mdash; An American student missing in Syria for several days amid a swirl of protests has been detained by Syrian security officers, the man&rsquo;s father said Saturday.        

Pathik Root, a 21-year-old Middlebury College student spending the semester in Damascus, is &ldquo;safe and well&rdquo; in the hands of the Syrian government, according to a message posted on the college&rsquo;s Web site by his father, Tom Root.        

Meanwhile, American officials said Saturday evening that they were investigating reports that a second American had been detained by Syria&rsquo;s repressive government during the recent unrest.        

&ldquo;U.S. Embassy personnel will reach out to the appropriate Syrian authorities to obtain more information&rdquo; about the second American, said Mark Toner, a State Department spokesman. Mr. Toner did not identify the second American. The Associated Press said that relatives of a 32-year-old from Austin, Tex., Mohammed Radwan, said he had been detained. It cited a report by Syria&rsquo;s state news agency that the man had confessed to selling video footage of the protests and to having visited Israel, which is not allowed by Syria.        

A cousin of Mr. Radwan told The A.P. that she last heard from him last week when he sent a Twitter message from a mosque in Damascus where Syrian security forces were battling protesters.        

Syria&rsquo;s government has blamed foreigners for stirring up the wave of protests over the past week. The gatherings turned bloody when government troops fired on demonstrators.
