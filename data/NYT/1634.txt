MOSCOW &mdash; It was a strange week for Russia&rsquo;s political elite.        

On Monday, officials were confronted with a rare moment of open disagreement between the two men who run the country. Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin issued a lacerating critique of the allied attacks on Libya &mdash; the kind of protest that accompanied Western interventions in Iraq and Kosovo. President Dmitri A. Medvedev, who had articulated a more pro-Western position, rebuked his mentor, calling Mr. Putin&rsquo;s language &ldquo;unacceptable.&rdquo;        

This put Russia&rsquo;s army of pro-Kremlin politicians in the uncomfortable position of navigating between the two men, either of whom could be president next year. And like children caught between squabbling parents &mdash; driven by the instinct for self-preservation that is universal &mdash; they did everything they could to avoid choosing one over the other. As Russia&rsquo;s Parliament on Wednesday devised a statement on the subject, it fell to political outsiders to state the obvious.        

&ldquo;I understand that you are stuck between two towers of the Kremlin, but why should Russia&rsquo;s international prestige suffer as a result?&rdquo; said Leonid I. Kalashnikov, a Communist lawmaker who advocated using Russia&rsquo;s veto power at the United Nations to block the airstrikes. His colleague Anatoly Y. Lokot described the compromise statement, which doled out equal criticism to Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi and the West, as &ldquo;the art of sitting on two chairs.&rdquo;        

With less than a year remaining before the 2012 presidential elections, it remains a mystery whether Mr. Medvedev will return for a second term or step aside to make way for Mr. Putin, who remains the country&rsquo;s most popular politician. Officials routinely dismiss rumors that the men are competing, and this week was no different. Government-controlled television glossed over their differences on Libya, and the moment passed, returning Russian politics to the uncertain state that will most likely continue for months.        

But two things seemed clear: first, that despite their alliance, the two men&rsquo;s instincts diverge on relations with the West; and second, that the people surrounding them are afraid to take sides.        

&ldquo;The social contract under which you are allowed to be at the top of the political elite is not to make a choice, to be seen as the servant of two masters,&rdquo; said Oksana Antonenko, a senior fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London.        

The politicians&rsquo; instinct &ldquo;is not to make choices, but to nip any choice in the bud,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Like a swamp, they seek to swallow and extinguish any spark of conflict.&rdquo;        

Mr. Putin&rsquo;s spokesman was among the first to do so, coming out the next day to say that Mr. Medvedev directs foreign policy and that the prime minister was simply expressing his &ldquo;personal point of view.&rdquo; Andrei A. Klimov, a lawmaker from United Russia, the governing party, said outsiders tended to exaggerate Mr. Putin&rsquo;s power over Russia&rsquo;s affairs &mdash; &ldquo;I know dozens of cases when Putin wanted one thing but another thing happened instead&rdquo; &mdash; as well as his differences with Mr. Medvedev.        

&ldquo;Even a man and his wife in one family have different views on the same subject,&rdquo; said Mr. Klimov, who is deputy leader of the Parliament&rsquo;s international affairs committee. &ldquo;Even twins may have different views on some issues. Therefore, there is nothing strange in the fact that people may have different nuances in their approaches.&rdquo;        

Nevertheless, the question of Libya seemed unlikely to fade away, tapping into the deep populist resentment that has lingered since NATO&rsquo;s bombing of Serbia in 1999.        

On Thursday, the former ambassador to Libya, whom Mr. Medvedev recalled from his post earlier this month, began speaking to Russian news media. He denied reports that he had called Mr. Medvedev a &ldquo;traitor,&rdquo; but acknowledged that he had sent a telegram warning that endangering Russia&rsquo;s commercial ties with Libya &ldquo;could be considered a betrayal of Russia&rsquo;s interests.&rdquo;        

He went on to endorse Mr. Putin&rsquo;s statement, which likened the United Nations resolution that allowed airstrikes to &ldquo;a medieval call for a crusade.&rdquo;        

&ldquo;What I especially like about Vladimir Vladimirovich is how he defines things clearly, briefly and forcefully,&rdquo; said the ambassador, Vladimir V. Chamov, in an interview with Moskovsky Komsomolets, a popular daily newspaper, referring to Mr. Putin. &ldquo;Here, I think, he was not far from the truth.&rdquo;        

Mr. Kalashnikov, the Communist lawmaker, said the Libyan question had brought to the surface a crucial difference between Mr. Putin and Mr. Medvedev: While they share the goal of economic integration with the West, Mr. Putin remains far more distrustful of Western geopolitical intentions. He said that his colleagues in United Russia were cautious on these issues because they did not know who would be leading Russia next year, and that was causing them &ldquo;personal stress.&rdquo;        

&ldquo;The longer this uncertainty continues, the harder it will be for them to work,&rdquo; Mr. Kalashnikov said. &ldquo;On one hand, people are waiting for a signal &mdash; a clear and visible signal &mdash; about who the candidate will be. On the other side there are collisions on questions like Libya. This leads to tension on a personal plane. How are they supposed to react to this?&rdquo;        

In fact, much of Russia&rsquo;s elite is suspended between the two men, hoping &ldquo;not to be the first to jump into this brawl,&rdquo; said Konstantin V. Remchukov, editor of the newspaper Nezavisimaya Gazeta. The waiting is taking a toll on the leaders themselves, and also on the officials and businessmen who make up their inner circles, he said.        

&ldquo;Nerves are failing,&rdquo; Mr. Remchukov said. &ldquo;They complain, &lsquo;I also need to understand where I will be in one year&rsquo;s time, or two years&rsquo; time. I need to know whether I will be the head of this monopoly.&rsquo; People who are close to Medvedev and Putin, they will also need clarity.&rdquo;
