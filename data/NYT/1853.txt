An Israeli-Arab actor and political activist who directed a children&rsquo;s theater in the West Bank city of Jenin was shot dead in his car by Palestinian militants, the police said. The man, Juliano Mer-Khamis, 52, who led the Freedom Theater in Jenin, was born to an Israeli Jewish mother and a Palestinian Christian father. Although he was an Israeli citizen, he had lived in Jenin for the past seven years. Mr. Mer-Khamis&rsquo;s mother, a peace activist, had founded the theater. He produced a film in 2004 on his mother&rsquo;s work called &ldquo;Arna&rsquo;s Children,&rdquo; which was widely praised internationally. The police said they were investigating the attack.
