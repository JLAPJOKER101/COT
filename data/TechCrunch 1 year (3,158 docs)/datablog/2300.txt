Erick and I were pretty much of the same mind when it came to the Kindle Fire: its pretty darn nice. But will it Fly or Die? Find out in this exciting, Fruit-Ninja-infused episode.Were working on our Kindle Fire review as we speak  we took a bit of time to do the Nook Tablet review first  but thus far its been an interesting device. Like the Kindle, its Amazon incarnate, a device thats aimed at Amazon customers, dealing up Amazon content. It is compact, well-made, and, dare I say it, sexy as an ereader and, although a bit less interesting as a media device, its one of the most promising devices Ive seen.That said, there are lots of ereaders out there and this is one of many. Will it survive  fly or die, if you will? We shall see.
