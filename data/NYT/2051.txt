A group in Washington sued the C.I.A. on Thursday over its failure to release its history of the Bay of Pigs invasion, the United States-sponsored effort to topple Fidel Castro in 1961. The group, the National Security Archive, filed a Freedom of Information Act request for the five-volume history in 2005, but says it never received the required response. Only one volume has been released.
