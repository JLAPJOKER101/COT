Imams across Bosnia issued a rare joint message on Friday condemning violence in the name of Islam, a week after an extremist attack on the United States Embassy in Sarajevo shook the country&rsquo;s overwhelmingly moderate Muslim community. A 23-year-old gunman, a Muslim from neighboring Serbia, fired at the embassy, wounding one police officer before he was shot in the leg and arrested. Two other men were arrested and accused of aiding him in the attack, which the statement by the imams called a &ldquo;heinous and perfidious act of terrorism.&rdquo; All three suspects follow the strict Wahhabi branch of Islam, whose appeal to young people in Bosnia&rsquo;s rural areas has grown in recent years.
