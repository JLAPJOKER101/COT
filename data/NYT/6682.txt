The French government said it would not arrest the former spokeswoman for the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal, convicted for revealing confidential decisions during the trial of Slobodan Milosevic. The woman, Florence Hartmann, a French national, was convicted of contempt of court in July and fined $10,000 in the case, which involved disclosures she made in her 2007 book &ldquo;Peace and Punishment.&rdquo; The appeals panel of the United Nations court last month converted the fine into a seven-day prison term and asked French authorities to find and arrest Ms. Hartmann. Bernard Valero, the spokesman for the Foreign Ministry in Paris, said Monday that it would be impossible to fulfill the request. He said judicial agreements between France and the court do not apply to such offenses as contempt of court.
