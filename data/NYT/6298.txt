The leading candidate in next year&rsquo;s presidential election drew ridicule from critics over the weekend when, in response to a question at Latin America&rsquo;s biggest book fair, he was unable to completely name three books that had influenced him. The stumble played into the image that the candidate, Enrique Pe&ntilde;a Nieto of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, has tended more to his looks than his books. He mentioned &ldquo;parts of&rdquo; the Bible, erred on the author of another book and was not able to come up with a third. On Monday, the gaffe was compounded when his teenage daughter sent out a Twitter message calling his critics &ldquo;a bunch of idiots who form part of the proletariat.&rdquo; Mr. Pe&ntilde;a Nieto apologized for the tweet, calling it an &ldquo;emotional reaction.&rdquo;
