Team Lets Drink Tonight, consisting of developers Zephyr Pellerin, Allen Romero, Jeremia Kimelman and Hunter Hastings, took advantage of its opportunity at the TechCrunch Disrupt Hackathon and attempted to solve the age old conundrum of not having anybody to drink with.Users who desire company while they imbibe can sign into Lets Drink Tonight and answer four hard-hitting profile questions along the lines of Coolest person Ive shared a drink with? and Favorite drink? They can then select their location and whether they want to drink with Facebook Friends or whether theyre feeling like meeting new people.The app will then text you if theres someone around you ready to drink. Not a recipe for disaster, at all. Nope.So thus far Ive put in my info and let the world know that Im available for drinks, but the apps suggestion  a Mr. Vinodh Kumar  doesnt seem to be available (as in the link to his profile isnt working). Guess Im going to have go home and write about startups launching at TechCrunch Disrupt instead.Lets Drink Tonight backstage interview above, and Hackathon presentation below.
