Violence erupted on the streets of Chile&rsquo;s capital, Santiago, on Tuesday as tens of thousands of students staged another protest demanding increased financing for public education. Masked protesters burned cars and barricades, looted stores and threw furniture at the police, and some attacked an apartment building. Groups of masked protesters tried to break through barricades blocking the way to the presidential palace. Riot police officers drove them back, but the violence spread. At least 273 demonstrators were detained in protests around the country, including 73 in Santiago, the Interior Ministry said.
