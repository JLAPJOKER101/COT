The Guardian Council, Iran&rsquo;s top legal panel, has ruled that President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad overstepped his authority by assuming control of the Oil Ministry when he fired the oil minister a week ago, the state-run Fars news agency reported Friday. The report casts doubt on whether Mr. Ahmadinejad will be able to lead the OPEC meeting in Vienna next month, and suggests a further deterioration of his relationship with Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the country&rsquo;s supreme leader. The Guardian Council is partly appointed by the ayatollah. The council has not confirmed the report, which said that the president&rsquo;s appointment of himself as acting oil minister was unconstitutional. Last month, Mr. Ahmadinejad tried to dismiss the intelligence chief, but was reversed by Ayatollah Khamenei.
