A former Salvadoran military officer who has been charged in Spain with crimes against humanity for killings in El Salvador during that country&rsquo;s civil war appeared in United States District Court in Boston on Tuesday after he was arrested and accused of immigration violations. The former officer, Inocente Orlando Montano, who has been living in Everett, Mass., is one of 20 people indicted in Spain for the 1989 slayings of six Jesuit priests, their housekeeper and her daughter. Nine other men named in the Spanish indictment turned themselves in this month in El Salvador and are expected to fight extradition to Spain. Mr. Montano&rsquo;s arrest clears the way for Spain to seek his extradition.
