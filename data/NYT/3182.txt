Two men who were part of a group of attackers who stormed a Jalalabad bank in February, killing at least 38 people at point blank range, have been sentenced to hang, court officials said Monday. The two men, Matiullah and Zar Ajam, were sentenced to death by Afghanistan&rsquo;s highest court for the massacre, the court administrator said. A bank video of the attack shows the men calmly herding cowering bank customers toward them and then shooting them to death with AK-47 assault rifles. President Hamid Karzai would have to sign the death warrant for the sentence to be carried out.
