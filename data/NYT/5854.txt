President Hugo Ch&aacute;vez said he would host a &ldquo;cancer summit&rdquo; meeting in early 2012 for South American leaders who, like himself, have been treated for the disease. Mr. Ch&aacute;vez, left, who said he had surgery in June to remove a malignant tumor, said he would invite President Dilma Rousseff of Brazil; her predecessor, Luiz In&aacute;cio Lula da Silva, who began treatment for throat cancer late last month; and President Fernando Lugo of Paraguay. &ldquo;There will be no cancer or force that can hold us back because Latin America is experiencing a rebirth,&rdquo; Mr. Ch&aacute;vez told Venezuelan state television on Sunday. He said would wait to hold the summit meeting until after Mr. da Silva completed his chemotherapy. After several rounds of chemotherapy, mostly in Cuba, Mr. Ch&aacute;vez, 57, said last month that he was cancer-free. Ms. Rousseff, 63, received a diagnosis of lymphatic cancer in 2009 before her election, and doctors have said she is currently free of cancer. Mr. Lugo, 60, who was found to have lymphatic cancer in August 2010, has undergone treatment in Brazil and has also been declared cancer-free.
