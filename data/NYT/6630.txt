The Supreme Court has rejected an appeal by the United States seeking the extradition of an American fugitive, his lawyer said Thursday. A judge in Lisbon ruled last month against the extradition of the fugitive, George Wright, who escaped from a New Jersey prison in 1970 while serving a sentence for murder and armed robbery. The United States had appealed the ruling. Mr. Wright, who is also wanted for hijacking a jetliner from Detroit to Algeria in 1972, was apprehended by the Portuguese authorities in September. His lawyer, Manuel Luis Ferreira, said the Supreme Court informed him Thursday that it had ruled against the United States, but did not provide details about the decision.
