Fidel Castro said Tuesday for the first time that he had resigned five years ago from all official positions, including chief of the Communist Party, a job he was thought to still hold. In an opinion piece, Mr. Castro wrote that when he got sick in 2006, &ldquo;I resigned without hesitation from my state and political positions, including first secretary of the party ... and I never tried to exercise those roles again.&rdquo; The article, which was published on the state-run Cubadebate Web site overnight and in newspapers on Tuesday morning, caught many people by surprise. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s incredible. Nobody can believe it,&rdquo; said Magaly Delgado, a retiree in Havana. A Communist Party Congress is expected to name a new party leader in a few weeks &mdash; presumably Mr. Castro&rsquo;s brother, Ra&uacute;l, who is now president.
