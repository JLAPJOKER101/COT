China&rsquo;s top internal security official called for building a database containing information on each of China&rsquo;s 1.34 billion residents to improve &ldquo;social management,&rdquo; a term that encompasses the state&rsquo;s efforts to manage public dissent and head off protests in the name of maintaining stability. The official, Zhou Yongkang, said the system should be based on the resident identity cards issued to every Chinese citizen, and should include such details as each person&rsquo;s tax record and history of education and employment, as well as what property and vehicles he or she owns. Writing in Qiushi, a Communist Party magazine, Mr. Zhou said that a comprehensive database would help neighborhood watchmen enforce stability.
