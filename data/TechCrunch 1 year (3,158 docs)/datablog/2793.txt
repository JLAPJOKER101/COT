Whatever, man. Ive got 10 girlfriends. And theyre supermodels! You just dont know them, because they live in Canada.Oh, okay. Call one of them and prove it.Well, crap â€” now what? Enter FakeGirlfriend.co, a clever little service that lets you text your maybe-not-so-real girlfriend in a pinch, get a text back, and have her call you back a few minutes later. Because thats totally not a weird thing to do, right?Heres how it works:Of course, this thing probably wont fool anyone over the age of 10, if only because your digital-girlfriends prerecorded message has a tendency to talk through any and all interruptions and doesnt respond to anything directly. And if it does work, you still know that youre kind of weird.If anyone asks, just remember: like a bag of sand.(Side note: You would not believe how many weird stares I got while working on this post in a coffee shop.)
