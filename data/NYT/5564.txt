About 12,000 of Egypt&rsquo;s 350,000 police officers have begun a nationwide strike to demand better salaries and a purge of former government officials from senior security posts. In Cairo, about 3,000 police officers rallied in front of the Interior Ministry on Monday to push their demands, including a 200 percent raise. They also called for an end to trials of police officers in military tribunals. Outside Cairo, police officers blocked main roads and shut down police stations.
