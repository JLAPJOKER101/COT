The team behind security startup Whisper Systems has been acq-hired by Twitter, they have announced on their company blog this gorgeous Cyber Monday morning.We started Whisper Systems with the goal of improving security and privacy for mobile devices. We were attracted to this not only because we saw it as an opportunity to reinvent the security solutions that never really worked in the PC environment to begin with, but also because the stakes are much higher — due to the nature of mobile devices themselves — and we didnt like the way that things were looking.As Whisper Systems consists of just two employees, Moxie Marlinspike and Stuart Anderson, this has talent acquisition written all over it. In their year of being in business, the startup has built a variety of encryption products for Android phones and the web including WhisperCore, a product that encrypts all data on your phone, and TextSecure, a product that encrypts text messages.The team make it clear that after a brief period of down time, the Whisper Systems software suite would live on.Twitter wouldnt go into detail about what exactly the Whisper Systems team would be doing at Twitter (Im going to guess improving security), but did give us this statement The Whisper Systems team is joining Twitter starting today. As part of our fast-growing engineering team, they will be bringing their technology and security expertise to Twitters products and services. Were happy to have Moxie Marlinspike and Stuart Anderson onboard.
