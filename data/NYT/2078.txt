JAKARTA, Indonesia &mdash; A suicide bomber blew himself up during prayers in a mosque in a police station on Friday, wounding dozens and killing himself, antiterrorism officials said.        

The unidentified bomber attacked the police station in the West Java provincial city of Cirebon while officers and members of the public crowded into the mosque during Friday Prayer, leaving at least 28 wounded, said Air Marshal Chairul Akbar, the general secretary of Indonesia&rsquo;s National Antiterrorism Agency.        

Among the wounded was the city&rsquo;s police chief, who was slightly injured, Marshal Akbar said.        

Marshal Akbar said the attack was probably the work of Islamist militants suspected of being behind series of mail bombs sent to liberal Muslim and secular public figures earlier this year. &ldquo;They just want to create chaos,&rdquo; Marshal Akbar said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the same militants. They&rsquo;re not based on religion &mdash; they attacked a mosque. They&rsquo;re just using the name of religion.&rdquo;        

Indonesia has won praise in recent years for arresting and killing militants linked to the radical Jemaah Islamiyah movement which was behind a series of deadly assaults including the killing of 202 people, mainly foreigners, in suicide attacks on Bali nightclubs in 2002. Despite progress against Jemaah Islamiyah and its splinter groups, analysts say militants have proved resilient, forming new cells and adapting new strategies in response to the crackdown.
