KABUL, Afghanistan &mdash; The British Foreign Ministry announced Wednesday that rockets found several weeks ago in Nimruz Province in the far southwest of Afghanistan were Iranian weapons en route to the Taliban.        

Calling the shipments to the Taliban &ldquo;unacceptable,&rdquo; the foreign secretary, William Hague, sharply criticized the Iranians for trying to aid the insurgency in Afghanistan. &ldquo;I am extremely concerned by the latest evidence that Iran continues to supply the Taliban with weaponry,&rdquo; Mr. Hague said. The weapons were &ldquo;clearly intended to provide the Taliban with the capability to kill Afghan and ISAF soldiers from significant range.&rdquo; He was referring to the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan.        

&ldquo;This is completely unacceptable,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;It is not the behavior of a responsible neighbor. It is at odds with Iran&rsquo;s claim to the international community and to its own people that it supports stability and security in Afghanistan.&rdquo; The shipment contained 48 rockets with a range of 12 miles, double the usual range of the rockets used by the Taliban, The Guardian reported, quoting diplomats who spoke on the condition of anonymity.        

Senior NATO commanders have warned repeatedly that Iran is supplying the insurgency with weapons, money and even training at camps on the Iranian side of the border.        

In May 2010, Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, then the NATO commander in Afghanistan, warned that Iran was training Afghan fighters inside Iran. Last March, Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told Congress that sizable weapons shipments from Iran had been intercepted.        

Iran appears to be interested in keeping Afghanistan unstable, in part because it is a way to undermine the United States, which it views as an archenemy.        

Iran is an overwhelmingly Shiite Muslim country, while the Afghan Taliban are Sunni Muslims.
