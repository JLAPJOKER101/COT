TUNIS (Reuters) &mdash; Tunisia has made a good start in its transition to democracy but faces a major challenge in meeting people&rsquo;s expectations of fast progress, the chairman of Europe&rsquo;s main rights and security watchdog group said Saturday.        

Foreign Minister Audronius Azubalis of Lithuania, who is the chairman of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, was in Tunis to discuss assistance for the North African country.        

The officials who took over after former President Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali was forced out by protesters this year appointed a new government early last month and disbanded the state security apparatus. The country will hold an election on July 24 to choose a constituent assembly that will rewrite the constitution and chart the country&rsquo;s transition.        

Although Mr. Azubalis praised those steps, he expressed caution. &ldquo;The public expectations for big changes could be too high,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;When you&rsquo;re building democracy, you should understand that it requires time.&rdquo;
