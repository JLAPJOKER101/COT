The leader of the military council ruling Egypt swore in a new cabinet on Thursday under pressure from protesters demanding faster change and a weeding out of those tied to former President Hosni Mubarak, who was ousted in February. The new government includes more than 10 new members, while 13 others kept their jobs. Activists welcomed some members of the new cabinet but said they did not expect it to be a powerful force for change since the military still retains ultimate authority. The cabinet is not expected to remain in office for more than four months, with parliamentary elections expected for October or November. The cabinet includes a new foreign minister, Mohamed Kamel Amr. Interior Minister Mansour el-Essawy kept his job despite protesters&rsquo; calls for his removal; they say he has not done enough to reform the police and security forces.
