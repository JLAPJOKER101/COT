The Kiev Appeal Court refused Friday to consider an appeal to release former Prime Minister Yulia V. Tymoshenko from jail, where she has been kept for a week while her abuse-of-office trial proceeds. Ms. Tymoshenko, left, was jailed last Friday for violating court procedures at her trial, including refusing to rise when asked by the judge. She says her resistance is a protest of a trial that she contends is politically motivated. In denying her appeal, the court said the criminal code did not allow the appeal of a preventive measure. Ms. Tymoshenko&rsquo;s lawyer said he would appeal that ruling to the Supreme Court.
