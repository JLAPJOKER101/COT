The Dutch branch of the Roman Catholic Church will start a compensation system that clears the way for victims of abuse by priests and other church workers to receive payments of up to $138,000, the church announced Monday. The country&rsquo;s Bishops&rsquo; Conference and Conference of Religious Orders said the system would probably take effect next month. Thousands of cases of allegations of sexual abuse by Dutch priests are under investigation by an independent, church-financed commission.
