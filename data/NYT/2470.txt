The United Nations on Friday condemned Nepal&rsquo;s appointment of a former Maoist rebel as a government minister while he was still a suspect in a kidnapping and murder case. The world body said that the government broke commitments to uphold human rights by appointing Agni Sapkota as minister of information and communications on Wednesday despite the open case against him. Mr. Sapkota has said that he was innocent of the 2005 abduction and killing, and that the accusation was political.
