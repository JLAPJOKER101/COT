It would seem that the iPhone 4S is one helluva record breaker. Apple recorded over 1 million pre-orders in the first 24 hours the phone was available, and a record 4 million devices sold in the first weekend. Thats double the amount of any other iPhones first weekend sales. But the iPhone 4S isnt just breaking records at Apple. AT&T has just announced that its iPhone 4S activations have topped 1 million. To date, AT&T has never seen so many activations during an iPhone launch, which says quite a bit since big blue is the only carrier to have had the iPhone since its initial entry onto the market. Verizon is set to release its activation stats tomorrow, at which point well be able to get a little more context for these numbers. In the meantime, its worth noting that AT&T has also been growing its Android presence, with Android sales doubling year-over-year.
