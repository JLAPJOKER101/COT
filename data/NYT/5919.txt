TEHRAN (AP) &mdash; An explosion at an Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps ammunition depot near Tehran killed at least 17 soldiers on Saturday, according to Iranian officials who characterized the blast as an accident.        

The explosion occurred while military personnel were transporting munitions at a base outside Bidganeh, about 25 miles southwest of the capital, said a spokesman for the Revolutionary Guards, Gen. Ramazan Sharif. &ldquo;My colleagues at the Guard were transporting ammunition at one of the depots at the site when an explosion occurred as a result of an accident,&rdquo; he said.        

At least 17 members of the force were killed, state television reported. The semiofficial news agency ISNA said 16 more soldiers were injured and hospitalized; General Sharif said some of them were in critical condition.        

Iran is fighting several internal insurgencies that have managed to stage deadly attacks in the past, including a double suicide bombing by a Sunni militant group in July 2010 that killed 26 people outside a mosque. The Iranian government has accused the United States, Israel and other Western allies of supporting such groups.        

But on Saturday, an Iranian lawmaker, Parviz Soroori, ruled out sabotage or terrorism in the base explosion. &ldquo;No sabotage was involved in this incident. It has nothing to do with politics,&rdquo; he was quoted as saying by the Parliament&rsquo;s Web site, icana.ir.
