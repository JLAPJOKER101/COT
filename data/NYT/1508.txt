PARIS        

&ldquo;I assure you, they can&rsquo;t strangle me in a dark corner!&rdquo; said Anne Lauvergeon, the embattled boss of one of France&rsquo;s largest nuclear enterprises, the largely state-owned Areva. When told that some would not mind strangling her out in the open, she leaned back and laughed.        

Ms. Lauvergeon, 51, known as Atomic Anne, is one of the most prominent female executives in Europe, and one of the most independent minded &mdash; perhaps too much so for France&rsquo;s male-dominated elite. She is fighting for her job, and as usual here, the battle is as much personal as professional. At the same time, the nuclear industry she represents is facing its largest challenge since the meltdown at Three Mile Island, and how the unfolding tragedy in Japan will affect her future is anyone&rsquo;s guess.        

She has an ambitious, global vision for Areva, which she constructed in 2001 as a merger of other French companies. Areva is engaged in nearly all aspects of nuclear energy, from mining and engineering to construction and recycling. Ms. Lauvergeon, Areva&rsquo;s first and only boss, seeks outside investors and clients, while others want to impose more centralized control over Areva, its assets and its profits, and want her gone.        

MS. LAUVERGEON is regularly listed by Forbes magazine as among the most important women in the world. In 2010, however, with the rise of Michelle Obama and Lady Gaga, among others, she fell to 24 from 9. Still, is her position as a feminist icon gratifying?        

&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an advantage, but also an inconvenience,&rdquo; she said, in a series of interviews in her office, filled with African and Asian art, overlooking the rooftops of Paris. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s strange, because being a woman is globally an advantage, especially in a very macho country, because you&rsquo;re very visible.&rdquo; But in France, she said, the matters are more subtle. &ldquo;Here you have the idea that if it&rsquo;s very serious, or it&rsquo;s a really attractive job, why not for a man?&rdquo;        

Such views are especially prevalent in industry, as opposed to services. People say, &ldquo;Yes, she&rsquo;s good, but she&rsquo;s not really an industrialist, because to be an industrialist you need to be &mdash; a man,&rdquo; she said, laughing again. &ldquo;You have some machismo in some remarks, but I&rsquo;m not obsessed by that. It&rsquo;s part of life, and I have to live with it.&rdquo;        

She was born into a middle-class family in Dijon; her father taught history and her mother was a social worker. She is married to a man who runs a small oil company; they have two children, a daughter, 11, and a son, 7.        

She had been a young star, an engineer who worked closely in her early 30s with the Socialist president, Fran&ccedil;ois Mitterrand, ending up as his representative, or sherpa, for major international meetings.        

Her father&rsquo;s family was on the soft left. And when she speaks about Mr. Mitterrand, she becomes &ldquo;a little moved,&rdquo; she said, telling the story of her grandfather, who was mayor of a village in Burgundy, and how as a child she first met the man her family called &ldquo;Le Fran&ccedil;ois,&rdquo; never simply Fran&ccedil;ois.        

She deeply admired Mr. Mitterrand, but was puzzled when he would return a memo he had demanded, and he would write on it, &ldquo;Vu,&rdquo; or seen. She wondered what it meant, what it was that he had seen.        

So one day, in the middle of the second page of a technical memo on Polish debt, she introduced a spelling error. &ldquo;It came back to me circled, with an enormous &lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; in the margin. And at that moment, that was happiness. Even these dreadful notes on the Polish debt! He read me!&rdquo;        

Things have not been so easy with President Nicolas Sarkozy. Mr. Sarkozy was an early champion and asked her to join his new government in nearly any capacity. But Ms. Lauvergeon said that she wanted an industrial career, not a political one.        

DID she make a mistake?        

&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it was my mistake,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s a fact: he was always convinced that I was made to do politics, and I&rsquo;ve always been convinced that I was made to run a company. He tried to pull me onto a political path, and I refused.&rdquo;        

Mr. Sarkozy was subtle, she said. &ldquo;He asked me, &lsquo;What do you want?&rsquo; I&rsquo;m sure that&rsquo;s the dream for a politician to have a new president say, &lsquo;What do you want for a ministry?&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; She answered simply, &ldquo;I have what I want.&rdquo;

She never told him never, she said. &ldquo;And it is true that it is not always easy to say &lsquo;no&rsquo; to Nicolas Sarkozy.&rdquo; But she did. &ldquo;I did it with a smile,&rdquo; she said, then added, laughing, &ldquo;But maybe the smile was not sufficient.&rdquo;        

Time passes. &ldquo;He wants to say &lsquo;no&rsquo; to me now!&rdquo; she said, laughing again. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a kind of revenge.&rdquo;        

Her main rival is Henri Proglio, the chairman of the E.D.F. (&Eacute;lectricit&eacute; de France), the world&rsquo;s largest producer of nuclear power and one of Areva&rsquo;s main customers, who is considered close to Mr. Sarkozy. Both he and Ms. Lauvergeon insist that their battle is not personal, but about which company is best able to chart the future for the nuclear industry. When he was appointed in November 2009, Mr. Proglio named himself &ldquo;captain&rdquo; of the French nuclear team and said that Areva was the wrong model and should be dismantled.        

But Areva is an international company, Ms. Lauvergeon argues, and E.D.F., which owns 2.2 percent of it, has gone from representing 80 percent of Areva&rsquo;s sales when the company was founded 10 years ago to 25 percent today. E.D.F. still likes to think of Areva as its factory, &ldquo;as its little dog,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But we are independent and must stay independent.&rdquo; She uses an aircraft metaphor: Areva is Airbus, selling planes to many different clients who compete with one another, not just to Air France. &ldquo;So to say that Air France should be selling Airbus planes, well, that doesn&rsquo;t correspond to the market.&rdquo;        

While the world is already re-examining the safety of nuclear power, France depends upon it, with 77 percent of all electricity coming from nuclear reactors, which emit no carbon dioxide. French officials have made it clear that there is no going back from nuclear, given demands to reduce global warming. Mr. Sarkozy said this week that nuclear energy was &ldquo;an essential element of our energy independence and of the fight against greenhouse gases.&rdquo; Nuclear technology is also an important export, especially for Areva.        

Ms. Lauvergeon has already cited the company&rsquo;s newest reactor, the third-generation European Pressurized Reactor, as much safer than the older ones at the center of the crisis in Japan. It produces less waste and offers more security, including dual containment buildings and a passive cooling system. Two now being built in Europe have experienced costly delays and construction problems, and two are being built in China. But the market for safer reactors is likely to be strengthened by the Fukushima accident.        

IT&rsquo;S a dicey time for Ms. Lauvergeon. Her term runs out in June, and she has powerful adversaries.        

An administrative edict, issued in sleepy August last year, required directors of majority state-owned companies finishing their second terms to undergo a competition for reappointment &mdash; a law that seemed aimed at Ms. Lauvergeon. She said she welcomed the competition and sardonically pointed out that the edict did not apply to those finishing their first or third terms. Nor, she conceded, did it specify &ldquo;skirts and high heels.&rdquo;        

While she was recently described by the weekly Le Point as &ldquo;cooked,&rdquo; she is considered to be in better shape now, partly because she is a feminist icon, partly because she is refusing to go quietly and partly because politics have shifted. It may also be, her intimates imply, that the government is a little bit afraid of her.
