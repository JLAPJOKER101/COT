ISLAMABAD, Pakistan &mdash; At least six people were killed and more than a dozen were wounded on Monday by a pair of bombs in northwestern Pakistan that were aimed at security forces, officials said.        

The first attack took place Monday morning near Peshawar, the capital of the restive Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Province, formerly called North-West Frontier Province, where security forces are battling the Taliban insurgency. Rasheed Khan, a deputy superintendent of the Peshawar police who had been involved in operations against the Taliban, was killed when a teenage suicide bomber attacked a police vehicle on the outskirts of the city.        

Mr. Khan&rsquo;s driver, a security guard and two pedestrians also were killed, and 10 people were wounded, the police said.        

An official with the bomb disposal squad in Peshawar called the attack &ldquo;very well planned&rdquo; and said the bomb was carefully constructed. &ldquo;The explosive used was of very high quality,&rdquo; the official, Shafqat Malik, said in a telephone interview. &ldquo;Pellets were also used in the making of the suicide jacket to cause maximum impact.&rdquo;        

Hours after the first attack, the authorities said, a police official was killed and three others were wounded when a homemade bomb aimed at another police vehicle detonated.        

There was no immediate claim of responsibility in the attacks. Investigators suspect the involvement of Taliban insurgents.        

Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani strongly condemned the violence. In a statement, he said police officers were sacrificing their lives to protect the public and reiterated his government&rsquo;s commitment to fight terrorism.
