The government has approved plans for a $30 billion public works project dubbed &ldquo;Le Grand Paris,&rdquo; which President Nicolas Sarkozy hopes will prove a durable legacy of his leadership. The project, whose approval was noted in an official decree published Friday, will include the construction of more than 100 miles of automatic subway lines and 57 new stations, linking the suburbs around Paris in a massive figure 8. Mr. Sarkozy had aspired to remake the capital and solicited proposals from renowned architects, who offered extravagant visions of airborne parks, expansive greenery and futuristic towers. But his ambitions ran up against political and financial limits. The first new subways are planned to be in operation by 2018, according to the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; du Grand Paris, the state authority in charge of the project.
