Tunisian authorities have filed new charges against the ousted leader, Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali, and his wife over the killing of protesters during the revolt against his rule, the official TAP news agency reported on Wednesday. The agency said the charges stemmed from the shooting deaths of several protesters by security forces in the town of Ouardanine, when protesters tried to stop a nephew of Mr. Ben Ali from fleeing. The authorities have said the charges against Mr. Ben Ali included voluntary manslaughter and drug trafficking. They are seeking his extradition with his wife from Saudi Arabia.
