ISLAMABAD, Pakistan &mdash; A former Pakistan Navy commando has been arrested in a sweep by Pakistani intelligence agents in connection with the audacious attack last week on the naval base in the southern port city of Karachi that apparently was planned with inside information about the facility, security officials said Monday.        

The former commando, Kamran Malik, was detained last Friday along with his brother.        

The arrests, which have not been officially announced, reflected suspicions that the attackers had access to knowledge about the naval base that could only have been obtained from within the base itself. The May 21 assault, which lasted 16 hours, left at least 10 security officers dead and destroyed two American-made aircraft.        

Local Pakistani news accounts reported that Mr. Malik had been court martialed 10 years ago on charges that he had assaulted a senior colleague, and that his telephone had been tapped in 2008 after an attack on a naval academy in Lahore.        

It was unclear precisely how Mr. Malik could have helped the naval-base attackers, who numbered at least four. But Pakistani officials have said the attackers could not have succeeded without advance knowledge.        

&ldquo;It is clear that somebody provided them with help,&rdquo; the interior minister, Rehman Malik, who is not related to the former commando, said Sunday when he visited Lahore to console the family of a Naval officer killed in the attack on the naval base.        

The attack was an enormous embarrassment to the Pakistani armed forces and intelligence services, who are still reeling from the May 2 killing of Osama bin Laden by American commandos who raided a compound in the city of Abbottabad, about 75 miles from the capital. The raid raised basic questions about whether some people in the Pakistan military had known that Bin Laden, the mastermind of the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, was hiding there.
