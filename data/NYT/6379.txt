Six decades after a massacre during Indonesia&rsquo;s struggle for independence, the Dutch government apologized for the killing on Friday. The Dutch ambassador, Tjeerd de Zwaan, made the apology before hundreds of villagers in Rawagede, the scene of the killing of up to 430 boys and young men by Dutch troops on Dec. 9, 1947. Dutch troops arrived in the village looking for a resistance leader. When the villagers said they did not know where he was, the soldiers rounded up nearly all the men and took them to a field where, squatting in rows with both hands placed on the backs of their heads, they were shot one by one. The apology followed a landmark ruling by a Dutch court in September that said the state was responsible for the massacre.
