The Paris police say they have seized nearly 300 tons of contraband souvenirs &mdash; mostly miniature Eiffel Towers &mdash; in a crackdown targeting illegal vendors of such trinkets in tourist areas. The police on Thursday announced the arrest of four Chinese citizens who operated a shop in central Paris that supplied souvenirs to street vendors who fan out daily across the capital without being registered with the city, as required. The police say that illegal vending cuts sales by authorized souvenir vendors by half.
