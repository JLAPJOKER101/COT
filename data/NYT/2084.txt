MOGADISHU, Somalia &mdash; After receiving more than $3 million in ransom, Somali pirates released a hijacked ship and some of its crew, but kept the Indian crew members to try to win the release of pirates held by India, pirates and residents said.        

&ldquo;We are holding the Indian nationals to exchange for our colleague prisoners that the Indian government is holding currently in their prisons,&rdquo; a pirate named Ahmed said.        

The Indian Navy has been aggressively patrolling the shipping lanes off East Africa, where piracy has been rampant, and has captured more than 100 pirates. Last month, the Indian Navy reported capturing 61 pirates as they fled a hijacked vessel that caught fire after navy patrols attacked it in the Arabian Sea off Kochi, India.        

The ship released Friday, the Indian-owned Asphalt Venture, was hijacked late last year. The ship was held off the Handule area of Harardhere, a pirate hub.        

It was not clear how many Indian crew members the pirates still held.
