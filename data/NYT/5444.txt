A bomb blast near a Baghdad liquor store killed seven people and wounded 18 on Monday, officials said. Three of the dead and five of the wounded were police officers. It was not immediately clear whether the primary target was the liquor store, a target of conservative Shiite militants, or the police officers, a target of Sunni militants. A roadside bomb exploded near a police patrol, killing one civilian.
