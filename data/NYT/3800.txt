President Hugo Ch&aacute;vez said Friday that he would return to Cuba to begin a new phase of cancer treatment including chemotherapy. Mr. Ch&aacute;vez, 56, said he would go to Havana on Saturday &ldquo;to begin what we&rsquo;ve called the second phase.&rdquo; He had surgery in Cuba last month to remove a cancerous tumor from his pelvic region. He acknowledged Wednesday that he required further treatment for cancer but has not said what kind of cancer he has. On Friday, he said he was sending a letter to the president of the National Assembly to secure authorization for his trip, as required by the Constitution.
