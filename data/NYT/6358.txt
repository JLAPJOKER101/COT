BERLIN (Reuters) &mdash; German antiterrorism police officers arrested a 27-year-old man on Thursday in the western city of Bochum who was suspected of links to a Qaeda cell and of planning an attack, the federal prosecutor said in a statement.        

The man, a German citizen identified only as Halil S., is believed to have been recruited by the so-called D&uuml;sseldorf cell and to have raised money for a planned attack by fraudulent use of eBay, the online auction site.        

A spokesman for the prosecutor&rsquo;s office said there were no signs of specific plans or targets.
