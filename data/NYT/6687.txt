The president of Kazakhstan, Nursultan Nazarbayev, who has appointed several relatives to government jobs in the Central Asian nation, fired his son-in-law Monday from one of them: manager of the country&rsquo;s sovereign wealth fund. Timur Kulibayev, who is married to Mr. Nazarbayev&rsquo;s second daughter, lost his job after at least 16 people died in violence between striking oil workers and the police this month.
