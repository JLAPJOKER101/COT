SARRAN, France &mdash; Corr&egrave;ze is the most indebted of all of France&rsquo;s 100 departments, and former President Jacques Chirac appears to be the prime reason.        

Mr. Chirac&rsquo;s family hails from here, deep in rural France, and his wife, Bernadette, is an elected member of the department&rsquo;s governing council and deputy mayor of this tiny village of about 280 people. As president from 1995 to 2007, Mr. Chirac directed many expensive public works projects to the area, including roadways, an airport and a strange sort of museum devoted to displaying nearly all the varied gifts he received as president.        

Built on farmland 19 miles from the departmental capital of Tulle, the museum was opened in December 2000 and then expanded in 2006. It cost a total of 16.7 million euros, or about $23 million, shared by various levels of government, but with the largest part borne by Corr&egrave;ze.        

It is beautifully designed and holds a fascinating collection of lavish kitsch given to Mr. Chirac from the world&rsquo;s variety of democracies and despots.        

The financial problems of Corr&egrave;ze reflect a larger national difficulty with budget deficits. As France struggles to cut its deficit, which is putting a strain on its bond ratings, the perilous finances of its departments is getting more attention.        

While the national government can borrow and issue bonds for operating expenses &mdash; last year the budget deficit was about $207 billion, and it is optimistically forecast at $124 billion this year &mdash; local governments cannot. They can borrow only for capital investment and must have a balanced budget.        

At the same time, through various &ldquo;decentralizations,&rdquo; the national government has been dumping responsibility downward onto the departments, including the costs for most roads and maintenance, school construction and caring for the elderly, the handicapped and the long-term unemployed.        

Corr&egrave;ze, a rural department in south-central France whose population is both sparse and aging, now finds itself more than $476 million in debt &mdash; the highest per capita of any French department, about $1,600 a person, triple the national average. Corr&egrave;ze&rsquo;s cumulative debt is 10 times higher than it was in 2000 and now is bigger than the annual department budget of $455 million.        

With one of the oldest populations in France (13 percent are 75 or older) and the economic crisis meaning fewer property sales &mdash; the prime source of local tax revenue &mdash; expenses have gone up considerably while receipts have declined. And there is no realistic possibility of raising local taxes.        

&ldquo;Our problem is that the state, which transferred the responsibilities and sets the rules, should have compensated us for the costs, but didn&rsquo;t do it,&rdquo; said Dominique Ceaux, the administrative head of the Corr&egrave;ze governing council, the Conseil G&eacute;n&eacute;ral.        

The cost of caring for the elderly, for example, has increased to $50 million a year from $33 million in 2002, he said, but the national government  provides less than a quarter of it.        

&ldquo;The state transfers more and more charges downward that it does not compensate,&rdquo; he said. President Nicolas Sarkozy has announced a continued freeze in the national government&rsquo;s contributions to the departments, which are important administrative divisions.        

The Socialist government of Corr&egrave;ze, elected in March 2008, a year after Mr. Chirac left office, is required to pay the mortgage on the debt incurred in the Chirac period, now $48 million a year in principal and interest, or more than 10 percent of the department&rsquo;s annual budget.        

Fran&ccedil;ois Hollande, the president of the Conseil G&eacute;n&eacute;ral and a member of the National Assembly from Corr&egrave;ze, has slashed the investment budget in half, to $69 million, with road construction hit hardest. He has tried to cut staff and costs, promoting home care for the elderly rather than building retirement homes.        

Mr. Hollande wants to show responsibility. He is the former head of the Socialist Party and former partner of S&eacute;gol&egrave;ne Royal, who lost the presidency to Mr. Sarkozy in 2007 as the Socialist candidate and who plans to run again in 2012 &mdash; as does Mr. Hollande.        

&ldquo;When we arrived in office we discovered, as expected, that they had invested too much,&rdquo; he said in an interview after opening an exhibit of artistically odd musical instruments. &ldquo;The state has sent to the local levels many of its expenses. And then there was the economic crisis,&rdquo; with a rise in unemployment and drop in business activity.        

The problem is hardly limited to Corr&egrave;ze. About a third of France&rsquo;s departments are deeply in debt. The problem became so acute that in December, the National Assembly approved a special, one-time grant of $207 million to the 30 most indebted departments. Mr. Ceaux said Corr&egrave;ze would get about $14 million, a drop in the bucket. &ldquo;We wanted to ask for something reasonable,&rdquo; he said.
