RABAT, Morocco (AP) &mdash; Thousands of democracy activists in Morocco protested on Sunday to demand more government accountability, two days after voters overwhelmingly approved a new Constitution that the king said would expand freedoms.        

The demonstrations were a show of strength for the February 20 Movement for Change, the group whose rallies over the past few months helped to pressure King Mohammed VI to amend the Constitution.        

&ldquo;We are here to say no to the referendum and the Constitution,&rdquo; said Oussama Khlifi, a founder of the group, which unites young, Facebook-fluent activists and members of Morocco&rsquo;s Islamist movement. &ldquo;We want a parliamentary monarchy with a king that reigns, but does not rule, and we want a real fight against corruption.&rdquo;        

Morocco, a North African country of 32 million, has been swept by democracy demonstrations &mdash; as in other countries across the Arab world &mdash; denouncing low wages, poor education and endemic corruption.        

But protesters have not called for the ouster of the 47-year-old king, who remains popular. Instead, they have called for the curtailing of his absolute powers and more official accountability.        

The king, who came to power in 1999, said he presented exactly that in the new Constitution, which was approved by 98 percent of voters on Friday, with a 70 percent turnout. Activists called those numbers an exaggeration.
