The governor of oil-rich Tamim Province cut the electricity to Baghdad from a power station in his province on Monday over a dispute with the central government that he said had left his residents without power in the winter. The governor, Abdul-Rahman Mustafa, said residents in Kirkuk, the province&rsquo;s capital, had only three hours of power each day. He said failed negotiations with the Electricity Ministry to share power generated at a plant in nearby Taza gave him little choice but to cut the electricity supply headed to Baghdad. He estimated it would take 25 hours to shut down the power supply to Baghdad.
