Pakistani military officers have begun returning to coordination centers in Afghanistan, NATO said on Monday, calling it a sign that tensions were easing, nearly a month after American airstrikes killed 24 Pakistani soldiers. But Pakistan has not reopened the supply lines for NATO forces in Afghanistan that run through its territory. The supply lines were closed by Islamabad in the wake of the airstrikes, on Nov. 26, which infuriated Pakistani officials and put more strain on America&rsquo;s troubled alliance with Pakistan. NATO forces generally get about two-thirds of their supplies in other ways, but the land route through Pakistan remains vital, and NATO asked again on Monday for the roads to be reopened to supply convoys. Pakistani officials did not immediately respond to the request. A Pakistani military spokesman, Maj. Gen. Athar Abbas, said that liaison officers were returning to the coordination centers, which are meant to ease communications among the Afghan and Pakistani armies and the NATO coalition, all of which operate near the border.
