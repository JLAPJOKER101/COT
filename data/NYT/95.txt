Egypt&rsquo;s president, Hosni Mubarak, told Israel on Thursday to &ldquo;review its positions and policies and to adopt tangible confidence-building measures&rdquo; toward the Palestinian Authority in order to allow a resumption of peace talks, an Egyptian official told reporters after talks between Mr. Mubarak and Israel&rsquo;s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. Mr. Netanyahu asked Mr. Mubarak to try to persuade the Palestinians to return to &ldquo;direct, intensive and serious&rdquo; negotiations, the Israeli government said in a statement. Israeli-Palestinian talks have been stalled since September. Mr. Mubarak also warned Israel not to carry out a new offensive in Gaza, according to Egypt&rsquo;s official news agency. The Israeli military said that at least 10 rockets and mortar shells had been fired from Gaza against southern Israel since Jan. 1.
