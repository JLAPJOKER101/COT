MILAN (AP) &mdash; Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi of Italy paid for sex with an under-age Moroccan teenager 13 times last year at his villa near Milan, prosecutors said in a document filed Tuesday seeking indictments against three of Mr. Berlusconi&rsquo;s aides accused of soliciting prostitutes for him.        

Prosecutors have formally closed the investigation and are seeking indictments against the three aides, whom they accuse of identifying possible sex partners for Mr. Berlusconi and informing them of payment and other compensation. A judge must now decide whether to indict the aides &mdash; Nicole Minetti, Dario Mora and Emilio Fede.        

Mr. Berlusconi separately faces trial in Milan on April 6 on charges of having sex with an under-age prostitute and using his influence to cover it up.        

Mr. Berlusconi, 74, has denied all the charges. The teenager, Karima el-Mahroug, now 18, has denied having had sex with Mr. Berlusconi and says she has never worked as a prostitute.
