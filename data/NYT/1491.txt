HAVANA (AP) &mdash; Government supporters surrounded the home of a leading Cuban dissident on Friday, yelling insults at her and other opposition figures who had gathered inside to mark the anniversary of a notorious crackdown on dissent in the country.        

About 200 pro-government demonstrators encircled the house of the dissident, Laura Pollan, who is one of the leaders of the opposition group Damas de Blanco, or Ladies in White. They called the dissidents &ldquo;worms&rdquo; and shouted slogans in support of Fidel and Raul Castro.        

The Ladies in White, who are wives or mothers of former and current political prisoners, have been marching peacefully each Sunday since their relatives were arrested in a government crackdown in March 2003 that put 75 activists, intellectuals and social commentators behind bars, most with long sentences on charges that included treason.        

The government reached a landmark agreement with the Roman Catholic Church last year to free the 52 political prisoners who were still serving sentences after the crackdown.
