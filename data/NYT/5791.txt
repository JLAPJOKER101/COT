Fourteen soldiers have been sentenced to jail terms ranging from 16 to 40 years for firing on a family group in 2007, killing two women and three children, Mexico&rsquo;s defense ministry said late Thursday. Human rights advocates say that President Felipe Calder&oacute;n&rsquo;s campaign against powerful drug traffickers has led some soldiers to overstep their powers. The Defense Ministry called the deaths a &ldquo;regrettable error.&rdquo;
