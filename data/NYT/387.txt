As President Robert Mugabe, 86, pushes for elections this year, a civic group reported Friday that its audit of the voter rolls found that 27 percent of those registered were dead. It also found that more than 2,000 registered voters were over 100 years old in a nation where life expectancy is 47 years. The Zimbabwe Election Support Network, which researched the voter rolls, concluded they were vulnerable to fraud and needed an overhaul.
