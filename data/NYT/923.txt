A French court on Friday convicted the prominent commentator &Eacute;ric Zemmour on charges of &ldquo;provocation to racial discrimination&rdquo; for televised comments in which he suggested that a majority of criminals in France were &ldquo;black and Arab,&rdquo; and said that employers &ldquo;have the right&rdquo; to deny employment to those ethnic groups. Mr. Zemmour was ordered to pay over $14,000 in legal fees and damages to the five rights groups that were the plaintiffs in the case, and also received suspended fines totaling $2,700. The commentator had &ldquo;gone beyond the permitted bounds of the right to freedom of speech,&rdquo; the court wrote in its decision, adding that Mr. Zemmour had a particular responsibility to respect those limits as a &ldquo;professional of the media and of expression.&rdquo; Mr. Zemmour&rsquo;s lawyer, Olivier Pardo, said his client had not yet decided if he would appeal the decision.
