After days of acrimony between Hamas and Egypt over limitations on who could pass through the Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt, Hamas said Egypt had agreed to allow 550 people a day to leave Gaza and to lengthen the operating hours of the crossing. The crossing was shut for much of the past four years after Israel, with Egyptian cooperation, closed it to pressure Hamas, which rules Gaza. Hamas said differences remained, chiefly concerning blacklists of Gazans who were forbidden to travel during Hosni Mubarak&rsquo;s rule.
