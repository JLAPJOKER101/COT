LONDON &mdash; A 31-year-old woman has been arrested as part of the investigation into voice mail hacking at Rupert Murdoch&rsquo;s now-defunct News of the World, police officials said Wednesday.        

The woman was accused of &ldquo;conspiracy to intercept voice mail messages,&rdquo; according to a statement from Scotland Yard. She was arrested early on Wednesday and held at a police station in Northumbria, in northeast England.&nbsp;        

She is the 17th person to be arrested since police opened a comprehensive inquiry into accusations that the newspaper had hacked the messages of almost 6,000 celebrities and newsworthy figures between 2001 and 2009 in search of scoops.        

The scandal has seen Mr. Murdoch and his son James called before Parliament; two of Britain&rsquo;s top police officers have been forced to resign; and the Prime Minister David Cameron questioned over his hiring of a former News of the World editor, Andy Coulson, as his spokesman. Mr. Coulson was among those arrested.&nbsp;        

Scotland Yard declined to identify the woman, or to provide further information, but the BBC and other British news media named her as Bethany Usher, a former News of the World reporter who is currently a lecturer in journalism at Teesside University. Ms. Usher did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment.&nbsp;        

The police announced last week that they had made the first arrest in a connected investigation into computer hacking. A 52-year-old man was detained on the outskirts of London on suspicion of unspecified offenses involving computer misuse and invasion of privacy. He has not been identified by name, but was granted bail until December.&nbsp;
