The Muslim Brotherhood has expelled a senior member for saying he would run for president in national elections in September, in defiance of the group&rsquo;s decision not to seek the post. The position has been vacant since the overthrow of President Hosni Mubarak in February. The ousted member, Abdel Moneim Abou el-Fotouh, said in a statement that he was &ldquo;not concerned&rdquo; with the decision to expel him.
