The Vatican on Wednesday told a breakaway traditionalist group with which Pope Benedict XVI has taken pains to reconcile that it must accept certain church teachings before being fully brought back into the Roman Catholic Church. The Vatican&rsquo;s chief doctrinal officer, Cardinal William J. Levada, met with Bishop Bernard Fellay of the Society of St. Pius X, which split with Rome to protest the liberalizing reforms of the Second Vatican Council. In 1988, Pope John Paul II excommunicated the group's founder, Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre, as well as four bishops he consecrated without the approval of the Vatican, including Bishop Fellay. In 2009, Benedict lifted the excommunications of the four bishops, even though one of them, Richard Williamson, had denied the scope of the Holocaust.        

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;In a statement on Wednesday, the Vatican said that the group must accept the terms of a &ldquo;doctrinal preamble,&rdquo; which it did not make public, before a &ldquo;hoped for reconciliation&rdquo; could be reached. In the past, the Vatican had said that the group must accept the teachings of the Second Vatican Council, including its reconciliation with Judaism and other religions, which Bishop Fellay has said the group will not do. In a statement on Wednesday, the Vatican appeared to leave more room for debate, saying Vatican II was grounds for &ldquo;legitimate discussion.&rdquo;
