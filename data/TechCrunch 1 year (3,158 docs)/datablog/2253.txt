Im not convinced these are discounts youve really been waiting 364 days for, but Apples Black Friday deals have gone live this morning. The prices leaked earlier, but hey.If you were looking at buying a new Mac, iPod or the latest iPad, nows the time, even if the discounts arent really that big in terms of percentages. You can also save some cash on a bunch of accessories, ranging from peripherals to iPad Smart Covers and even iTunes Gift Cards. The iPhone gets no Black Friday love.No worries: there are other gadgets that we think you should look for on Black Friday.Third-party offerings are also on display on Apples site, with some interesting deals: Jawbones JAMBOX can be bought for $148 instead of $199.95 (a $51.95 discount) and the lovely Parrot AR.Drone is available for purchase at a price of $248 instead of $299.95 (also a $51.95 cut).Heres a limited list of promotions Apple is running today (and today only):iPad 2 Store link$41 off on 16GB  ($458 instead of $499)
