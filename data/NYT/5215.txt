ISTANBUL &mdash; The Turkish police detained more than 140 pro-Kurdish political activists in a nationwide sweep on Tuesday, including a number of elected mayors in Turkey&rsquo;s predominantly Kurdish southeast.        

The detentions, reported by NTV television and other news outlets, were carried out as part of an investigation into suspected links between activists and Kurdish separatist insurgents who have escalated attacks on Turkish targets in recent weeks.        

Hundreds of pro-Kurdish political activists are already in jail awaiting trial on charges of supporting the P.K.K., the Kurdistan Workers Party, which has been fighting for Kurdish autonomy in Turkey since the 1980s. Turkey, as well as the United States and the European Union, has classified it as a terrorist organization.        

Many of the people detained on Tuesday, along with those already awaiting trial, are members of the Union of Kurdistan Communities, which prosecutors contend is the political wing of the P.K.K., in charge of recruitment and financial support.        

Amid escalating P.K.K. violence since July, the governing Justice and Development Party ordered an intensive military air and artillery operation against the group&rsquo;s bases nearby in northern Iraq, while it still urges political dialogue with parties that have denounced the P.K.K.        

The pro-Kurdish Peace and Democracy Party has refused to condemn the P.K.K., but ended a parliamentary boycott last week to join efforts to draft a new constitution, which is expected to grant more ethnic rights to the about 15 million Kurds in Turkey.
