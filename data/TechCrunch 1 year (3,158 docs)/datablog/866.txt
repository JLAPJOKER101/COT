Office Hours in New York was a huge success last week. We met the guys from Krossover, along with quite a few other really badass startups which well post about when the time comes. That said, I want more. More, more, more. (Im greedy like that.)So were officially posting our second round of Office Hours. This time, instead of a coffee shop, were hitting startup turf: DUMBO Incubator in Brooklyn.Whether youre adding new features to a year-old app, still in the idea phase, or working on your first round of funding, we want to know whats up. This isnt just for us to pick up stories (though thats a huge plus), its for you guys to get feedback on what youre working on.Ill be heading up Office Hours by my lonesome this time, as John needs to run off to Omaha or something for some  thing. Either way, thats good news for you since Im the sweet to his sour.The deets: Office Hours will be held from 2:30pm to 5:30pm on May 9 on 20 Jay St. at the DUMBO Incubator. If you want to sign up, check out my Ohours profile and reserve a slot.Note: If you are the first to nab a slot, then were good to go. Even if it says pending. First-come, first-served.
