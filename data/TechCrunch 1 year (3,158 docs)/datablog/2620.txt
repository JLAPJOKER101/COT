A day after Google announced that 190 million Android devices have been manufactured to date, Sony Ericsson this morning revealed that 22 million of those that were sold were its Android-powered Xperia smartphones. In fact, 80 percent of the companys sales now comes from higher-end mobile devices, which is why Sony Ericsson will be shifting its entire product portfolio to smartphones during 2012, the company said.Sony Ericsson estimates that its share of the global Android-based smartphone market during Q3 was approximately 12 percent in volume.As the companys President and CEO Bert Nordberg put it recently: they probably should have taken the iPhone more seriously when it was introduced.The company broke even  albeit barely  during Q3, after making a €49 million (~$67.6 million) profit in the third quarter last year, and reported a tiny year-on-year drop in revenue. Revenue for the third quarter of this year was about €1.59 billion (~$2.19 billion), compared to €1.6 billion a year earlier.The company blamed the drop in net income on higher taxes and lower margins.Units shipped during the quarter were 9.5 million, a 9 percent decrease year-on-year due to a decline in feature phone shipments.The earnings come a week after the WSJ reported that Sony may soon buy Ericsson out of the partnership. The company declined to comment on said report during the Q3 earnings call.
