Im not even going to pretend that you dont know what Angry Birds is that would be insulting to both you and the game. But do you know what Angry Birds Space is? Nah, I didnt think so. And truth be told, Im not quite sure what it is either.According to Rovio, Angry Birds Space will be the biggest launch for the company to date. Remember what a big deal Angry Birds Rio was with that whole 20th Century Fox partnership and a movie and all that jazz? Well guess what! Space is even bigger.If you cant tell from the past few sentences, Im pretty excited about this. Angry Birds is the most popular mobile game in the world ever and Seasons and Rio were excellent additions to the series. But living/playing in a regular world, or a seasonal world, or even in an islandy world are things weve all done. Chilling out in space, on the other hand, is not.There are little to no details so far. In fact, all we know is that the red bird looks much more devilish in space and that the game will debut on March 22. I predict that aliens will be our nemeses, and that gravity (or rather, a lack thereof) wont be an issue.You can check out the teaser video below and head on over to the official teaser page to download an Angry Birds Space wallpaper and/or glare into the burning eyes of our favorite little red bird.
