KAMPALA, Uganda &mdash; Most of the 100 military advisers being sent to Uganda to help hunt down the Lord&rsquo;s Resistance Army, a brutal guerrilla group in central Africa, will stay in Uganda, which the group has not attacked in years, an American government official said Monday.        

Speaking at a news conference at the American Embassy in Kampala, the official, Virginia Blaser, the charg&eacute; d&rsquo;affaires, said the operation would begin this month and did not have a deadline.        

&ldquo;We are here and we are engaged with Uganda in the region in a support role, in an advisory role; not in a combat role, not in a leading role, not in an operational role,&rdquo; Ms. Blaser said.        

&ldquo;We are prepared to do what we need to do,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only part of a longer-term strategy.&rdquo;        

While most of the 100 military advisers will remain in Uganda to work with the country&rsquo;s military, a small number will be sent to jungle &ldquo;field locations&rdquo; where the Lord&rsquo;s Resistance Army has been operating, areas that include the Central African Republic, Congo and South Sudan.        

Ms. Blaser emphasized that American forces would not engage in direct combat, except in self-defense, and she dismissed questions about whether the advisers would also be used to secure American interests in Uganda&rsquo;s nascent oil industry or to fight Islamist extremists in the region, saying their role was &ldquo;L.R.A.-specific.&rdquo;        

The operation is intended to &ldquo;end the threat&rdquo; posed by the guerrilla group, she said.        

&ldquo;We continue to call on L.R.A. fighters to peacefully disarm,&rdquo; Ms Blaser said. &ldquo;At the same time, we are committed to helping the victims of the L.R.A. begin to return to normal life.&rdquo;        

The guerrilla group has harassed Uganda and central Africa for more than two decades, abducting children, and mutilating, raping and killing civilians. Their activities have created instability in what the American government calls &ldquo;some of the most difficult terrain in the world&rdquo; where some of the world&rsquo;s poorest countries meet.        

Since 2008, Ms. Blaser said, the L.R.A. has kidnapped more than 3,400 people, and it has carried out roughly 250 attacks so far in 2011 alone.        

The United States has supported regional efforts to battle the Lord&rsquo;s Resistance Army, encouraged by a handful of advocacy organizations like the Enough Project and Invisible Children. Ms Blaser said the United States government and aid organizations had spent hundreds of millions of dollars in an effort to rehabilitate northern Uganda, where the guerrillas used to be based.        

But the Ugandan military said Monday that the group had not attacked Uganda itself since 2005.        

The United States has helped plan and pay for offensives against the group before, including an operation in 2008 and 2009, which was seen as a failure after the guerrillas dispersed into small groups and carried out retaliatory attacks, killing up to 900 civilians.        

&ldquo;We are very mindful of this risk,&rdquo; Ms. Blaser said. &ldquo;We take this risk very seriously. I can assure you the military advisers and personnel are also aware of this risk.&rdquo;        

&ldquo;Because let&rsquo;s not forget,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;this isn&rsquo;t just about the military who are out in these regions, it&rsquo;s about the civilians.&rdquo;        

The leader of the Lord&rsquo;s Resistance Army, Joseph Kony, was almost caught by Ugandan troops this month, a military official said, according to a Ugandan newspaper article published Sunday.
