A Pakistani court granted bail on Thursday to the person suspected of being the mastermind of a deadly 2009 attack on the Sri Lankan cricket team. The suspect, Malik Ishaq, left, had been kept in jail since 1997 on a series of terrorism charges, and he was showered with rose petals by hundreds of waiting supporters as he left prison. &ldquo;We will peacefully continue our mission,&rdquo; Mr. Ishaq told reporters, saying his hard-line Sunni group, Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, would continue to pursue its anti-Shiite struggle through legislative means. The group is suspected to have been a central player in several terror attacks in the Punjab Province of Pakistan, and had been linked to the March 2009 attack, which killed six police guards and two bystanders in the eastern city of Lahore and halted international cricket competitions in Pakistan. The date for the trial has not been set.
