France&rsquo;s main electricity company announced on Wednesday that it had delayed for another two years the completion of a third-generation nuclear power plant in Flamanville, in northern France, citing structural problems, construction accidents and new tests for safety after the Fukushima nuclear accident in Japan. The European pressurized reactor, already delayed, is now expected to be finished in 2016, and the cost for the project is expected to rise to six billion euros. &ldquo;This delay is linked to both structural and economic reasons,&rdquo; the company, EDF, said in a statement.
