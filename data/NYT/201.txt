A Palestinian girl paralyzed in an Israeli airstrike on Gaza will be allowed to remain in Israel for medical care, according to a government document released Wednesday. The decision enables the girl,  Marya Amen, 9, along with her brother and father, to stay in Israel as temporary residents. The status ensures state-sponsored health insurance and compensation for the girl, who needs a respirator to breathe. The girl was wounded in a 2006 airstrike against Islamic Jihad militants in Gaza City. Her mother, a brother and a grandmother were killed. Since then, she has been at a Jerusalem hospital while her family fought attempts by Israel to transfer her to a West Bank facility  they said could not treat her condition.
