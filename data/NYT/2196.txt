American diplomats are asking election officials to explain how they awarded 18 seats to lawmakers in the March 20 runoff, the United States Embassy said Friday. The embassy said it &ldquo;found no explanation for the reversals&rdquo; in the final results in those races. In all except two cases, the reversals benefited the governing party. Demonstrations erupted in the countryside after the election commission released final results on Wednesday giving seats to legislators who were not the top vote-getters in preliminary results.
