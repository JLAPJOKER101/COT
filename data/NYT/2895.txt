The Vatican on Friday welcomed AIDS experts from around the world for a two-day symposium on preventing H.I.V. and caring for people with the virus, just months after Pope Benedict XVI, left, made groundbreaking comments about condoms and AIDS. Conference organizers insisted that the meeting would not call into question traditional Roman Catholic opposition to artificial contraception. Yet the pope&rsquo;s comments last year about condom use with prostitutes infected with H.I.V. seem to have removed a Vatican taboo that had all but ruled out public discussion of whether condoms were even effective in reducing H.I.V. transmission. In November, Benedict said condoms were never a moral solution to fighting AIDS. But he said someone, like a male prostitute, who used a condom to prevent H.I.V. transmission might be showing a first sign of a more moral and responsible sexuality because he was looking out for the welfare of another person.
