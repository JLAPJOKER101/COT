Apple has updated its MacBook Pro offering on the Apple Store, reports This Is My Next, after 9to5Mac earlier leaked details of the notebook product line-up refresh. Dont expect to see spectacular changes, as the tweaks are relatively minor. They include faster processors, more storage and a number of small graphics updates.Confirming earlier leaks of the new line-up, the entry-level 13-inch MacBook Pro now comes with a 2.4 GHz dual-core processor (before: 2.3 GHz) and a 500 GB hard drive (before: 320 GB). The basic 15-inch MacBook Pro now sports a 2.2 GHz quad-core processor (before: 2.0 GHz), while the 17-inch MacBook Pro has been upgraded with a 2.4 GHz quad-core processor (before: 2.2 GHz).Both the 15-inch and the 17-inch machines have been given some graphics upgrades as well (the change: from AMD Radeon HD 6750M to HD 6770M  learn more here).The prices of the slightly upgraded models have not been changed.
