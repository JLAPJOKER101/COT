Reflecting on our first fiscal year as a public company, we have many accomplishments to be proud of and much to look forward to in the year ahead. Pandora continues to rapidly disrupt the radio industry and has only just begun to realize the potential of our $37 billion U.S. market opportunity.Although competitors like Spotify and Echo Nest are entering the market, Pandora doesnt seem to be too worried. As co-founder Tim Westergren told Fast Company recently, Pandora has 125 million registered users and the average user listens to radio service for more than 18 hours a month.In December, Pandora announced  that they would be launching a series of free, live concerts for some of their listeners.
