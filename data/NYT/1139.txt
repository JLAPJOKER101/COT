Russia will arm a group of disputed islands at the center of a growing debate with Japan with antiship missiles and attack helicopters, the Interfax news agency cited the military general staff as saying Tuesday. Russian P-800 rockets, known as Yakhonts, will be deployed on the islands, which Russia calls the Southern Kuriles and Japan calls the Northern Territories, Interfax quoted an unnamed representative of the general staff as saying. Russia also plans to send Mi-28N battle helicopters to the islands, Interfax cited the representative as saying.
