BAGHDAD &mdash; An Obama administration proposal to keep a few thousand American troops here after the end of the year to train the Iraqi military is being scaled back, as the administration has concluded that the Iraqi Parliament would not give the troops legal protection, two American officials said on Saturday.        

Both countries are still discussing whether to keep some trainers in Iraq, although the number of troops is most likely to be far less than the 3,000 to 5,000 that the administration had discussed with Iraqi leaders, one of the American officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the continuing negotiations.        

The officials said the administration&rsquo;s plans changed in recent weeks as it became clear that the Iraqi Parliament would not give legal immunity to the American troops, something the Pentagon had insisted would be needed if troops were to continue to operate here.        

Two weeks ago, the leaders of the Iraqi political blocs said they wanted American troops to remain to train the Iraqi military after the year&rsquo;s end, but would not provide them legal protections.        

The United States and Iraq agreed in 2008 that all troops would withdraw by the end of 2011. If a significant number remain in Iraq, the agreement would have to be amended through the Iraqi Parliament. Some troops could remain under an expanded diplomatic presence through the United States Embassy or through a NATO training mission. Civilian contractors have also been envisioned to help in the training.        

Even if American and Iraqi negotiators cannot reach agreement on a training force by the withdrawal deadline, they could still return next year to negotiations that would allow the return of some American personnel.        

Both the White House and Pentagon released statements saying that no final decision on a remaining force had been reached.
