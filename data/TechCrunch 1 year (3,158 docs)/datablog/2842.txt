At TechCrunch, we dont just want you to survive, we want you to thrive. Thats why were offering one Toshiba Thrive tablet to one lucky commenter. What is a Thrive? Its a 10-inch Honeycomber with plenty of gusto and its waiting to wing its way to your home, office, cloister, or dance hall. Heres how to win.Comment below. Since this is the first weekend giveaway in a while, Im going to limit this to US addresses only and dont whine about Facebook comments, Mr. GNU License. Until we figure out a more capable way to pick a winner, this is how were going to do it. Comment once and only once and Ill close the contest on Monday at Noon Eastern. Thanks for playing and have a thriving weekend.Update  Congrats to Joey Ruhl, winner of the Thrive.
