AMMAN, Jordan &mdash; King Abdullah II of Jordan announced on Sunday that the government would in the future be elected, not appointed, responding to a demand of protesters calling for democratic change.        

But the statement did not generate immediate excitement among pro-democracy campaigners in Jordan, largely because it failed to specify any timetable for the change.        

Jordanian political activists, inspired by the so-called Arab Spring movement that began in Tunisia, have called for curbs on the sweeping powers of the monarch, who appoints the country&rsquo;s prime minister and cabinet and can dissolve Parliament.        

In a televised speech broadcast live, the first such address since protests broke out here six months ago, King Abdullah said that new political legislation should &ldquo;guarantee the fairness and transparency of the electoral process through a mechanism that will lead to a Parliament with active political party representation.&rdquo;        

He added that the legislation should allow &ldquo;the formation of governments based on parliamentary majority and political party manifestos in the future.&rdquo;        

A national dialogue committee, formed as a result of protests, has proposed changes to the election law, and the king said he expected the next parliamentary elections to be conducted according to legislation compatible with its recommendations. He did not say when those elections would be held or how the law was to be reworked to satisfy complaints it was designed to prevent opposition from gaining power.        

Labib Kamhawi, a political analyst, said that the speech was &ldquo;good on some points and weak on others.&rdquo; He emphasized that the king had committed himself only to elected governments eventually.        

Apparently taking aim at some of his opponents, the king warned against what he described as &ldquo;the dictates of the street,&rdquo; the deterioration of political and media discourse, and he emphasized his &ldquo;opposition to chaos that leads to destruction.&rdquo;        

King Abdullah, an important American ally, has also been contending with an economic crisis. The protests, which have ebbed in recent weeks, have represented the first challenge to his rule.
