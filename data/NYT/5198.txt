BEIJING &mdash; Three brothers of Liu Xiaobo, the imprisoned dissident writer who was given the Nobel Peace Prize last year, were allowed to visit him in a prison in northeast China on Sept. 28, one of the brothers told Agence France-Presse on Tuesday.        

The brother, Liu Xiaoxuan, said Mr. Liu &ldquo;was looking very well&rdquo; and had been allowed to attend a memorial service for his father in the northeastern city of Dalian on Sept. 18. The brothers visited Mr. Liu in a prison in Jinzhou, Liaoning Province.        

Mr. Liu was sentenced to 11 years in prison for inciting subversion of the state for his essays and a manifesto he helped draft, Charter 08, which demands political reform, human rights guarantees and an independent judicial system.        

Last October, the Nobel committee announced that he was being given the Peace Prize, but the Chinese authorities did not allow him to travel to Oslo for the ceremony in December. Liu Xia, his wife, has effectively been under house arrest in Beijing and is not allowed to meet with journalists.
