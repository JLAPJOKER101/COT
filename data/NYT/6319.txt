Nearly two months after Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi was killed, Libya&rsquo;s interim government, under pressure to disarm Tripoli and restore order to the country, has given regional militias lingering in the capital until late December to hand over security and go home, officials said on Tuesday. Prime Minister Abdel Rahim el-Keeb met officials from Tripoli&rsquo;s local council to discuss ways of sending home hundreds of out-of-town fighters who have become a pseudo-police force there, setting up checkpoints across the city. The head of Tripoli&rsquo;s local council, Abdul Razzak Buhajar, said on Tuesday, &ldquo;There is a schedule for this process.&rdquo; When asked when the militias would leave, he said, &ldquo;In December,&rdquo; adding, &ldquo;We have to be patient.&rdquo;
