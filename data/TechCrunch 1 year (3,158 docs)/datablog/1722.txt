HouseParty.com, a site that helps people throw brand-sponsored home parties, has raised $5.3 million in Series C funding in a round led by New York-based Acadia Woods Partners.Partiers need to apply online, indicate what type of in-home event theyre planning and take charge in spreading the word to their friends and relatives. Once selected for a house party, they receive a package of products from sponsoring brands  Party Packs have included food, baby toys, health and beauty products and action figures in the past.The idea is for brands to get some relatively cheap word-of-mouth marketing by gathering people in real life (who do this in exchange for freebies) in the hope that the parties will spark conversations about the brand and, ultimately, turn the people who show up into customers or even advocates.People can also shop for party supplies on HouseParty.com.The company has raised about $8 million to date.
