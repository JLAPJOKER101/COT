Theres an old saying in London. You wait an hour for a bus and then three come along at once. Thus, for the last few years people have been asking me when London would get a large technology conference which catered for startups. Admittedly I had a good go with GeeknRolla, which has now been replaced by the London Web Summit on March 19. But now London is being spoiled by yet another event: Le Web, the huge annual conference in Paris in December, is adding a Summer edition conference in London. If youre looking for a third bus to complete the analogue, then check out Digital London, a slightly more corporate event but one which looks like it has some interesting tracks on the future of cities, innovation and entrepreneurship.Due to be held on June 19th and 20th, Ive heard that Le Web London is partly the result of heavy lobbying by the U.K. government and the U.K. Trade and Industry departments Tech City team to get them here. So it looks like our taxes are starting to bear a little fruitâ€¦The venue will be Central Hall Westminster, so super central London. No confirmed speakers as yet but were sure Loic and Geraldine Le Meur will pull off a great show with great speakers, as their contact book in Silicon Valley is hard to beat.Registration is now open, including a 50 percent discount on the ticket price for the next two weeks and a special discount package for Le Web London and Le Web Paris.Meanwhile, please dont ask in the comments if they will change the name to The Web for London. That joke boat has sailed.Heres Loic and Geraldine with the announcement.
