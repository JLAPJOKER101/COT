CAIRO &mdash; The death toll from the weekend&rsquo;s clashes between the military police and protesters demanding the end of military rule rose to 15 on Wednesday, but the five days of street fighting appeared for the moment to come to an end.        

A day after a march by thousands of women angry about the soldiers&rsquo; brutal treatment of women, the streets around Cairo&rsquo;s central Tahrir Square were quiet for the first time since the clashes began on Friday morning. The only major demonstration was a protest at a university over the killing of a medical student over the weekend.        

The violence ebbed just in time for Egyptians to return to the polls. They cast votes to conclude the second of three rounds in the first elections for a lower house of Parliament since the ouster of Hosni Mubarak. Nearly 60 seats were at stake in a legislature of more than 500. Most races pit Islamists against Islamists, with the mainstream Muslim Brotherhood competing against the ultraconservatives known as Salafis.
