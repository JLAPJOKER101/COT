BEIRUT, Lebanon &mdash; Seven Estonians who were kidnapped nearly four months ago while cycling in Lebanon&rsquo;s eastern Bekaa Valley were released Thursday, Lebanese officials said.        

A security official said the group was released Thursday morning to a French delegation in the eastern village of Ersal, along the Syrian-Lebanese border. They were driven to the French Embassy in Beirut, which represents their country here, while arrangements were being made for their return home. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak with the news media.        

A group calling itself Harakat al-Nahda wal-Islam, or the Movement for Renewal and Reform, which was previously unheard of, claimed responsibility for the March 23 kidnapping and demanded an unspecified ransom in a letter sent to Lebanon Files, a Lebanese news Web site. It was not clear if the crime was politically motivated, as were kidnappings in the 1980s during Lebanon&rsquo;s civil war years.        

Adnan Mansour, Lebanon&rsquo;s newly appointed foreign minister, said in a statement that he was relieved at the news which &ldquo;turns a worrying page for Lebanon.&rdquo;        

Estonia&rsquo;s Foreign Ministry confirmed the release and said that the seven cyclists were in good health.        

&ldquo;The main thing now is for our seven fellow countrymen to get home to their families and loved ones as quickly as possible,&rdquo; Estonia&rsquo;s foreign minister, Urmas Paet, said in a statement.        

The Lebanese official said 16 Lebanese people are believed to be involved in the crime, including a Syrian. One of the suspects, the suspected leader of the operation, died on April 11 in a shootout in the border village of Majdal Anjar.        

In mid-April, the seven Estonians appeared in a video posted by Lebanon Files in which they pleaded for help from Lebanese, Saudi, Jordanian and French leaders.
