Sobees, the startup that develops social newsfeed for the iPadNewsMix, is bringing digital news curation to Facebook via a new app. The aim of NewsMix is to make sense of the most popular content being shared by your Facebook friends. The NewsMix application for Facebook factors in Facebook “Likes” and brings together articles, photos, and videos posted by liked Pages on Facebook, as well as friends. Users can like new Pages directly from the application and share their NewsMix articles on their Facebook wall. You can also read your friends’ NewsMix (if they have the app installed), browse the Pages your friends like on Facebook and more.Of course, Facebook is rumored to be launching a new content experience this coming week at F8 and other news organizations are launching social products on the platform, including the Wall Street Journal. The News Corp-owned publication just debuted WSJ Social, a social news reader for Facebook.
