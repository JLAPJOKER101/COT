The new iPad (dubbed, simply enough, iPad) packs a slew of new hardware  the A5X system-on-a-chip, a 5-megapixel iSight camera, and perhaps most importantly for wireless connectivity fiends, an LTE radio. Yep, the new iPad will be Apples first LTE-capable device, and its very likely that it wont be the last.So far, Apple has revealed that LTE-friendly variants for Verizon and AT&T will be available, as well as for Canadian carriers Telus, Bell, and Rogers. Worldwide 3G support is understandably also part of the mix, so those of you who take the plunge without the right coverage will still be able to get those wireless data connections going. Expect battery life to take a hit while surfing on that 4G connection, though the reported 9 hours of use is certainly no slouch especially when the iPad itself is still hovering around 10 hours sans wireless data. Well see how this actually pans out though  the iPhone 4S was notoriously finicky when it came to battery, and that was a 3G-only device. Still, that minor detail probably wont keep most people from buying these things, so heres how the pricing breaks down for the 4G models.Apple is sticking to their standard pricing model here, with the 16GB, 32GB, and 64GB 4G iPads going for $629, $729, and $829 respectively. Pre-orders open today, so you should probably start wailing on the Apple Store website if you want to get in on the ground floor.Developing
