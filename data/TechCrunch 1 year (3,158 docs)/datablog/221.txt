Shes the new CEO of Yahoo as of today, but a PR from Yahoo has just told me that Marissa Mayer wont be on the Q2 earnings call, which is due to start in about 20 minutes.The call will not be led by Ross Levinsohn, either. It will be Tim Morse, the CFO, leading todays proceedings. Noting that it was only her first day on the job, he said that he would be taking listeners through Yahoos results, including an update on Alibaba. [Mayer] is very mindful of the investor community and I’m sure you’ll be hearing from her very soon, he said.Yahoo has just reported its second quarter 2012 earnings. The figures spell out the challenge ahead for the new leader: revenues came in at $1.2 billion, down one percent compared to the quarter a year ago. Revenues excluding traffic acquisition costs were $1.081 billion, flat compared to a year ago.That release did not make too much noise about Ms. Mayers appointment. The only mention was an unenthusiastic nod in the business-highlights section: Yahoo! named Marissa Mayer chief executive officer.More info here.If you want to listen into the earnings call, thats here. (Well also be reporting on it.)
