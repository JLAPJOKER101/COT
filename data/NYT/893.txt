The Finance Ministry said Thursday that an &ldquo;erroneous&rdquo; audit and inadequate help from international banking advisers compounded financial problems at the embattled Kabul Bank. After meeting with a top United States Treasury official, the ministry said that &ldquo;Afghan and U.S. officials agreed&rdquo; that fraudulent and unethical behavior were at the heart of the crisis, but that it &ldquo;was compounded by the erroneous audit by PricewaterhouseCoopers and inadequate international technical assistance and supervision.&rdquo; An American official, speaking on condition of anonymity, took issue with the statement, saying the responsibility of supervising Afghan banks rested with the Afghan government, not with outside auditors or international banking advisers. The audit was conducted by A. F. Ferguson & Company, a Pakistan-based member firm of PricewaterhouseCoopers, an international accounting and consulting company. A. F. Ferguson said Thursday, &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t understand the basis for this comment.&rdquo; Last October, the deputy finance minister said audits done by the company did not mention irregularities.
