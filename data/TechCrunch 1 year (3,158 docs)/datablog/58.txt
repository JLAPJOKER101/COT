Right on schedule, Microsoft has just announced on its Windows Team blog that Windows 8 has emerged from its long development and testing phase, and will soon be in the hands of manufacturers and OEMs for installation on new PCs and devices.Among those on the list to receive the final build (build 9200, if you were curious) are Lenovo, Acer, ASUS and Toshiba, though thats clearly just the tip of a very large iceberg.While average users wont be able to get their collective hands on the new OS before its official launch on October 26, Microsoft revealed when certain subsets of users could access the final build. Developers can download Windows 8 via their MSDN subscriptions on August 15, as can IT professionals with their TechNet subscriptions  lucky devils.In a separate blog post, Microsofts Stephen Sinofsky dives into greater detail about the RTM process and the steps that led up to it. One of the juicier tidbits Sinofsky addressed was just how many people participated in the Windows 8 preview program  over 16 million PCs took part in the preview, with a full 7 million of those PCs running on the companys Release Preview build. Solid numbers for what the company has referred to as a substantial reimagining of Windows as we know it, and the company hopes that same sort of momentum carries over into retail sales.With Windows 8 finally complete, Microsoft has begun to bring other parts of its ecosystem online. Take the Windows Store for instance  developers will soon able to submit paid apps into the new marketplace, though theyll have to have their RTM builds installed and ready first. That said, Sinofsky was quick to note that no software project is ever really done, so the company will continue to monitor feedback from both users and its myriad hardware partners.
