An independent Palestinian rights group said Thursday that the Hamas authorities in Gaza were searching the homes and questioning members of the rival Fatah party. A report from the Palestinian Center for Human Rights said one Fatah activist was held for 15 days, during which Hamas officers placed a plastic bag over his head during interrogation and subjected him to loud noises. On Monday and Tuesday alone, the report said, Hamas summoned about 50 former members of Fatah security forces, questioning them at length.
