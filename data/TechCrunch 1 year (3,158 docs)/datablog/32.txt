Facebook announced in a blog post today that they are doubling the sites release speed, rolling Facebook onto new code twice per day.Last week, in conjunction with the opening of our engineering office in London, we decided to double the release speed of facebook.com and indeed ship often, release engineering manager Chuck Rossi writes.First, there will be a push driven by Facebooks New York office, followed by the social networks regular daily push from the California team.Â Rossi says the developers are producing six times the amount of code per week as Facebook was in 2008, when he joined.Its exciting and I think it crushes what anyone else of our size and impact is doing. Ship early and ship twice as often, Rossi writes to close the post, firing a shot at Facebooks competitors.
