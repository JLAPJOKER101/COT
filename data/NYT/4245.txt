Pirate attacks off the coast of West Africa have increased to levels that rival those in Somalia, insurers say. The International Maritime Bureau says Nigeria and Benin reported 18 pirate attacks in the first half of 2011. While that number is smaller than figures attributed to Somali pirates, analysts say the number of attacks off Nigerian waters is underreported because some ships carry illegal oil cargo and others fear their insurance rates will rise. The United States and other Western nations have an antipiracy armada patrolling the waters off East Africa, but not in the west.
