Update: And thats a wrap! Well have a recording of the webcast up above shortly — in the mean time, check out some previously recorded material from our adventures on the show floor. Well be selecting the random Twitter winners and contacting them shortly. Good luck! (Update: and there it is)After a day of roaming the show floor in search of all things shiny and new, we thought itd be a good idea to gather up the crew and do one big ol recap of everything weve seen so far. Weve got gadgets, weve got guests — and, because we know how much you guys love free stuff, weve got a bunch of (really, really great) giveaways.Sony will be stopping by to show off some new tricks that the Playstation Vita has up its sleeve, Dells VP of Design Ed Boyd will be showing us the brand new XPS13 Ultrabook, and the TC Gadgets team will be running through the highlights of the show so far. Somewhere in between all that goodness, well be giving away a Nest, a Jawbone Jambox, and a Playstation Vita that the winner will get as soon as the device is launched in February.
