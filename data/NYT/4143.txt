Three Ethiopian peacekeepers who were wounded in a land mine explosion this week died while Sudan refused requests to let them be flown out of the region for medical care, the United Nations peacekeeping chief said Thursday. Alain Le Roy, under secretary general for peacekeeping, said a convoy of Ethiopian troops deploying to the new United Nations mission in the Abyei region of Sudan hit a land mine Tuesday, killing one peacekeeper instantly. Three others died in the next three hours as the United Nations tried to persuade Sudan&rsquo;s government to let a helicopter fly them out for treatment. &ldquo;They prevented us from taking off by threatening to shoot down the helicopter,&rdquo; Mr. Le Roy said. Seven other peacekeepers remain hospitalized.
