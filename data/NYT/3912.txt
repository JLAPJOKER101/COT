A teenage girl, whose kidnapping on Sunday from a park in Privas, in southeast France, riveted the country, was found unharmed on Friday, apparently taken by her fianc&eacute;&rsquo;s family as part of a Chechen premarriage ritual, the police said. The girl, who was not named and who was thought to be 16 or 17, was found by the police in the southwestern Haute-Garonne region with the family of her fianc&eacute;, said a spokeswoman for the Privas police. The family said they were simply following an old North Caucasus tradition, like others in the Chechen diaspora. The kidnapping originates as a response by a man when a young woman&rsquo;s family refuses a marriage. After the abduction and a night spent away from home, the young women is considered &ldquo;soiled,&rdquo; and the family would then consent to the union. Religious leaders among the Chechens, who are mostly Muslim, are trying to put an end to the tradition.
