Attorneys have filed a civil lawsuit in Belgium accusing NATO of killing 13 civilians, including three children, by bombing a residential compound of a former government official in Libya. The suit was filed on behalf of Khalid el-Hamidi, a retired general and member of Libya&rsquo;s Revolutionary Council, whose home was destroyed by two bombs on June 20, killing 13 people. Marcel Ceccaldi, a Paris-based lawyer who filed the suit, said it was a residence in a quiet civilian neighborhood and not a legitimate target under the Geneva Convention on the rules of war. At the time, NATO acknowledged it had fired on the compound but described it as a &ldquo;command and control&rdquo; center. A NATO spokeswoman, Carmen Romero, said Thursday that all NATO airstrikes in Libya are aimed at military targets and that great care is taken to avoid civilian casualties.
