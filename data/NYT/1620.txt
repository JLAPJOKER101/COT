MADRID (Reuters) &mdash; Spain&rsquo;s Supreme Court on Wednesday denied legal status to a new political party, Sortu, which was created as a successor to Batasuna, the banned political wing of an armed Basque separatist group.        

Sortu had wanted to field candidates in local elections across most regions on May 22.        

The separatist group, known as ETA, declared a permanent cease-fire in January, which was swiftly rejected by the national government. The government insists that ETA must disarm permanently and disband for a political arm to be taken seriously.        

The Supreme Court said it had decided not to include Sortu on the list of legal political parties. It said it would publish the full text of its ruling in the coming days.        

Sortu could appeal the ruling, but under law it has only two months to get the decision overturned.        

In its struggle for an independent Basque state in northern Spain and southwest France, ETA has been responsible for the deaths of more than 850 people over the past 50 years. It has been severely weakened by the arrests of its senior members.        

The French police arrested four members of ETA, including two military leaders, on March 10, bringing the number of members arrested this year to more than 30. The government says that ETA will never return to its former status, but that a peace process will take time.        

ETA was founded under the repressive Franco dictatorship, when Basque and other regional languages were banned. The group waged a campaign of bombings and shootings, and it is now the only armed guerrilla group still operating in Europe.
