A fire at the Rusafa prison in Baghdad killed 11 inmates and wounded 22 others on Monday, security officials said. &ldquo;All the time we hear about these kinds of incidents and we have to put an end to them, and we will investigate it,&rdquo; said Joma Ibrahim, a Parliament member. Another official, seeking to quell speculation that the fire might have been started in an attempted jailbreak, said the fire was caused by an electrical malfunction, The Associated Press reported.
