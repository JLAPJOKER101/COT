Were running the first ever TechCrunch Baltics meetup today with a mini-conference and pitch contest in the lovely city of Riga, Latvia. The Baltic nations of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia are tiny countries, but punch above their weight in terms of their technical prowess. Estonia in particular was made famous as being the base from which Skype was developed, and now the rest of the region is coming alive with startups and accelerators.  You can find the agenda here. Up to 8 selected Baltic startups will pitch to a jury and audience that includes many key investors in the region and beyond. We also have a dedicated twitter account @TCBaltics and the hashtag is #TCBaltics.Here is the live stream (right now its lunchtime but well be kicking off shortly):Appearing at the event include Aldas Kirvaitis (CEO, Cherry Media Group) who leads the Baltic daily deal operator that has grown from zero to a monthly run rate of 1.7m Euros and Baltic market dominance in less than 2 years; Jon Bradford (Managing Director, Springboard Cambridge); Carlos Eduardo Espinal (Partner, Seedcamp); , Priit Salumaa (Co-Founder and Member of the Board, Garage48); Margus Uudam (Ambient Sound Investments); Lars Hinrichs (Executive Geek & Founder, HackFwd); Kris Hiiemaa – CEO, Erply; Andres Susi – CEO, Flirtic; Vitaly Rubstein – Co-Founder and Partner, RubyLight.Our sponsors are Mail.ru, Rubylight, Nokia, Veritweet and logistically speaking the event organisers were TechCrunch Europe and the newly-launched TechHub Riga (as is obvious on my bio and Twitter profile Im a co-founder of TechHub in London).
