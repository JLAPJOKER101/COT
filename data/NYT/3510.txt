PARIS &mdash; The National Assembly on Thursday stripped a former government minister of immunity from prosecution for rape and sexual assault, a decision that will allow a criminal investigation against him to proceed.        

Georges Tron, the former minister of public works, was forced to resign in late May over allegations that he pressed at least two women who worked in the city hall where he is mayor into submitting to foot massages that turned into groping and even forced sexual encounters. The women said they were emboldened to come forward after a New York hotel chambermaid accused Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the former director of the International Monetary Fund, of attempted rape.        

However, Mr. Tron retains his seat as a deputy in the National Assembly and his post as mayor of Draveil, a small town south of Paris. He has denied the charges against him, calling them &ldquo;crazy.&rdquo;
