TEHRAN (AP) &mdash; Iran on Saturday freed two German journalists who were arrested four months ago after they interviewed the son of an Iranian woman condemned to death by stoning for adultery.        

Earlier, an Iranian court threw out the 20-month prison sentences handed down against the journalists, Marcus Hellwig and Jens Koch. The court commuted the sentences to $50,000 fines, state television reported.        

The Germans &mdash; a reporter and a photographer for the Bild am Sonntag newspaper &mdash; got caught up in a confrontation between Iran and the West involving the case of the condemned woman, Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani, a mother of two. She has been convicted of adultery and sentenced to death.        

The Germans were detained in October after interviewing Ms. Ashtiani&rsquo;s son, who had also been arrested, in Tabriz.        

They were found guilty of committing acts against Iran&rsquo;s national security. Officials also said that the Germans admitted to violating Iranian laws that prohibited working journalists from entering the country on tourist visas.        

But a court in Tabriz said Saturday that the Germans &ldquo;deserved to have their punishment commuted and enjoy Islamic mercy.&rdquo; Hours later in Berlin, Germany&rsquo;s Foreign Ministry said the two were in the care of German consular officials in Tabriz.
