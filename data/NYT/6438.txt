MANILA &mdash; The Philippine House of Representatives on Monday impeached the chief justice of the Supreme Court, alleging corruption and biased judgments in favor of former President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, who appointed him to the post.        

The impeachment in the House, which is expected to be followed by a trial in the Senate next year, is the result of a simmering battle between the country&rsquo;s popular president, Benigno S. Aquino III, and Supreme Court Chief Justice Renato Corona.        

&ldquo;This is more a battle of personalities than a conflict between the branches of government,&rdquo; said Florin Hilbay, a constitutional scholar with the University of the Philippines.        

Mr. Aquino has openly criticized the integrity of the high court under Mr. Corona, listing in a recent speech a string of decisions that he suggested were driven by interests other than those of the law. In the Dec. 5 address, the president said, &ldquo;The question now is: is the Supreme Court in violation of the Constitution?&rdquo;        

For his part, the chief justice has characterized the impeachment effort as an attempt to undermine the judiciary, pledging in an address to court employees on Monday that he would &ldquo;fight all who dare to destroy the court and our system of justice.&rdquo;        

The impeachment resolution was signed by 188 of the 284 members of the House, according to lawmakers.        

The congressman who heads the congressional justice committee, Niel Tupas Jr., denied in a television interview after the impeachment that Mr. Aquino directed the move. The congressman also refuted allegations of an attempt to weaken the court.        

&ldquo;We want to bring back the faith and confidence of the people in the judiciary,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It is the person we impeached, not the institution.&rdquo;
