Ukrainian authorities have formally rearrested the opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko on a new criminal charge, her lawyer said Friday. Ms. Tymoshenko, a former prime minister, was sentenced in October to seven years in prison for abuse of office, in a case widely seen as politically motivated. The re-arrest appears to doom her prospects of being released soon, because it means she would stay in jail on the new charge even if her conviction for abuse of office is overturned next week on appeal. The second charge relates to allegations of tax evasion and theft of government funds.
