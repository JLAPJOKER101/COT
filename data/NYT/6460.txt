An unarmed American military drone that had been used to monitor piracy off the East African coast crashed Tuesday at an airport on the Seychelles during a routine patrol, officials said. No one was hurt in the crash of the unmanned Air Force MQ-9 Reaper, according to officials at the United States Embassy in Mauritius, which also serves Seychelles. Lina Laurence of Seychelles&rsquo;s civilian aviation authority said the drone developed engine problems minutes into its flight and had to land immediately but could not stop before the end of the runway. The cause of the crash was being investigated.
