The Libyan government freed four New York Times journalists on Monday, six days after they were captured while covering the conflict between government and rebel forces in the eastern city of Ajdabiya. They were released into the custody of Turkish diplomats and crossed safely into Tunisia in the late afternoon, from where they provided a harrowing account of their captivity.        

Like many other Western journalists, the four had entered the rebel-controlled eastern region of Libya over the Egyptian border without visas to cover the insurrection against Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi. They were detained in Ajdabiya by forces loyal to Colonel Qaddafi.        

The journalists are Anthony Shadid, The Times&rsquo;s Beirut bureau chief, who has won two Pulitzer Prizes for international reporting; two photographers, Tyler Hicks and Lynsey Addario, who have extensive experience in war zones; and a reporter and videographer, Stephen Farrell, who in 2009 was captured by the Taliban in Afghanistan and was rescued by British commandos.        

After The New York Times reported having lost contact with the four last Tuesday, officials with the Qaddafi government pledged that if they had been detained by the government&rsquo;s military forces, they would be located and released unharmed.        

Bill Keller, the executive editor of The Times, wrote in a note to the newsroom that he was &ldquo;overjoyed&rdquo; at the news.        

&ldquo;Because of the volatile situation in Libya, we&rsquo;ve kept our enthusiasm and comments in check until they were out of the country, but now feels like a moment for celebration,&rdquo; he wrote.        

&ldquo;We&rsquo;re particularly indebted to the government of Turkey, which intervened on our behalf to oversee the release of our journalists and bring them to Tunisia,&rdquo; Mr. Keller added. &ldquo;We were also assisted throughout the week by diplomats from the United States and United Kingdom.&rdquo;        

A clearer account of the four journalists&rsquo; capture and detention has come to light now that they have been released.        

The four had been covering fighting near Ajdabiya last Tuesday when they decided that the battle had grown too dangerous for them to continue safely. Their driver, however, inadvertently drove into a checkpoint manned by forces loyal to Colonel Qaddafi. By the time they knew they were in trouble, it was too late.        

&ldquo;I was yelling to the driver, &lsquo;Keep driving! Don&rsquo;t stop! Don&rsquo;t stop!&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; Mr. Hicks recalled in a telephone interview from the hotel where he and the three others were recuperating. &ldquo;I knew that the consequences of being stopped would be very bad.&rdquo;        

The driver, Mohamed Shaglouf, is still missing. If he had tried to drive straight through, Mr. Hicks said, the vehicle certainly would have been fired on. In any event, the soldiers flung the doors to their gold four-door sedan wide open so quickly that they had little chance to get away.        

As they were being pulled from the car, rebels fired on the checkpoint, sending the four running for their lives.        

&ldquo;You could see the bullets hitting the dirt,&rdquo; Mr. Shadid said.        

All four made it safely behind a small, one-room building, where they tried to take cover. But the soldiers had other plans. They told all four to empty their pockets and ordered them on the ground. And that is when they thought they were seconds from death.        

&ldquo;I heard in Arabic, &lsquo;Shoot them,&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; Mr. Shadid said. &ldquo;And we all thought it was over.&rdquo;        

Then another soldier spoke up. &ldquo;One of the others said: &lsquo;No, they&rsquo;re American. We can&rsquo;t shoot them,&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; Mr. Hicks said.        

The soldiers grabbed whatever they could get their hands on to tie up their prisoners: wire, an electrical cord from a home appliance, a scarf. One removed Ms. Addario&rsquo;s shoes, pulled out the laces and used them to bind her ankles. Then one punched her in the face and laughed.        

&ldquo;Then I started crying,&rdquo; she recalled. &ldquo;And he was laughing more.&rdquo; One man grabbed her breasts, the beginning of a pattern of disturbing behavior she would experience from her captors over the next 48 hours.        

&ldquo;There was a lot of groping,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Every man who came in contact with us basically felt every inch of my body short of what was under my clothes.&rdquo;        

Their captors held them in Ajdabiya until the fighting with the rebels died down. Soldiers put the four in a vehicle and drove them out of the city around 2 a.m. One threatened to decapitate Mr. Hicks. Another stroked Ms. Addario&rsquo;s head and told her repeatedly she was going to die.        

&ldquo;He was caressing my head in this sick way, this tender way, saying: &lsquo;You&rsquo;re going to die tonight. You&rsquo;re going to die tonight,&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; she said.
