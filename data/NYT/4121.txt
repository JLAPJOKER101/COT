TOKYO &mdash; Japan&rsquo;s Parliament passed a law on Wednesday that will allow the use of public funds to shore up the company operating the crippled Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, and help it pay what is expected to amount to billions of dollars in compensation claims.        

The law creates a state-backed fund that will pay damages to victims of the disaster at the plant, where three reactors melted down and spewed radiation after cooling systems were lost in the March tsunami and quake. The government will initially pay nearly $26 billion into the fund, Banri Kaieda, the trade minister, told lawmakers on Tuesday.        

Swift compensation payments are vital not only in helping victims, analysts say, but also in helping to kick-start economic growth in the disaster zone. But the sheer size of the payments could easily render Tokyo Electric Power, the embattled operator of the plant, insolvent.        

Yukio Edano, the chief cabinet secretary, called the law &ldquo;a major step forward.&rdquo;        

Many uncertainties remain, however. Under the law, shareholders of Tokyo Electric Power, as well as other electric power companies in Japan, will also be asked to contribute to the fund.        

Though the government intends to keep Tokyo Electric Power, known as Tepco, afloat for the time being, Prime Minister Naoto Kan has said that Japan should revisit the company&rsquo;s fate.        

In addition, Japan fired three senior bureaucrats in charge of nuclear power policy on Thursday, holding them to account for a series of scandals over the government&rsquo;s relationship with the power industry, Reuters reported. The officials are Kazuo Matsunaga, the top bureaucrat at the Trade Ministry; Nobuaki Terasaka, chief of the Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency; and Tetsuhiro Hosono, leader of the Agency for Natural Resources and Energy .
