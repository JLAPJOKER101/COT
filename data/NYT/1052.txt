Rebels who control the northern Ivory Coast have seized a town in the west, in government-controlled territory, and said Friday that they were still advancing, raising the prospect of a return to civil war. The town, Zouan-Hounien, is near the border with Liberia. Loyalists of Laurent Gbagbo, the strongman clinging to power after an election most of the world says he lost, confirmed that the town fell and said they would fight to take it back. United Nations officials have warned that clashes this week in Abidjan and the west have pushed the country closer to open war.
