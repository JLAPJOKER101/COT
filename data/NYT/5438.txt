The two sons of former President Hosni Mubarak have an estimated $340 million in Swiss bank accounts, a senior Egyptian Justice Ministry official said Monday. The official, Assem al-Gohary, said Swiss authorities were investigating whether one of the sons, Alaa, was involved in money laundering along with other former government figures. Switzerland has already frozen the assets of the Mubarak family and other former officials.
