The appeals court that overturned the murder conviction of Amanda Knox in the killing of her British roommate gave the reasons for its ruling on Thursday. The appellate court in Perugia said the lower court verdict against Ms. Knox, an American, and her former boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, an Italian, was &ldquo;not corroborated by any objective element of evidence and in itself was not, in fact, probable.&rdquo; The inadequate evidence included the fact that no murder weapon had been conclusively identified, faulty DNA evidence and insufficient proof that Ms. Knox and Mr. Sollecito were even at the location where the crime occurred, the court said. The two were arrested for the killing in 2007, and sentenced to 26 years and 25 years, respectively, before their sentences were reversed in October.
