MEXICO CITY &mdash; A principal leader of a drug gang who the authorities believe was the mastermind behind the killings of three people connected to a United States consulate in northern Mexico last year and other bloody attacks has been captured, Mexico&rsquo;s federal police said Sunday.        

The leader, Jos&eacute; Antonio Acosta Hern&aacute;ndez, a former police officer known as El Diego, was arrested Friday. The police said that he confessed to ordering 1,500 killings as the head of La L&iacute;nea in Ciudad Ju&aacute;rez, the country&rsquo;s most violent city.        

President Felipe Calder&oacute;n, on his Twitter account on Sunday, called the arrest &ldquo;the biggest blow&rdquo; since he sent thousands of police officers to Ciudad Ju&aacute;rez last year after a rash of high-profile killings there, including the shooting deaths of three people &mdash; two Americans and a Mexican &mdash; with connections to the consulate after a birthday party on March 13, 2010.        

Mr. Acosta faces a United States indictment in connection with that shooting, which killed a consulate worker, who was four months pregnant, and her husband, who worked at the jail in El Paso, Tex. Killed that day in a separate shooting was Jorge Alberto Salcido Ceniceros, a Mexican citizen whose wife worked at the consulate.        

American law enforcement officials have said that the attack appeared to be a case of mistaken identity.        

The police said that in January 2010, Mr. Acosta ordered gang members to open fire on a party, and 15 people died, most of them teenagers with no evident connection to the drug trade.
