Considering the sheer amount of data people produce every day, theres really no such thing as having too much storage space. Users of cloud storage service Dropbox seem to agree, which is why the company revealed that it would be significantly bumping up the amount of storage space available to its paying users at no extra cost.According to Dropboxs official blog, the company will be replacing their 50 and 100 GB tiers with 100 and 200GB tiers for free. As GigaOM points out, that puts the total amount of storage on those tiers (before referrals and the like) at 102 and 202GB respectively, since the original plans factored in the 2GB of free storage thats open to everyone.On the off-chance that youre a lone (and determined) file hoarder, Dropbox plans to push a new 500GB plan live as well  no word yet on how much that will set you back. Once it goes online though, that new tier will be as high as users can go before getting into business-oriented Team territory. Sorry all you free users  theres not much in the way of good news for you today, but you can still bump up your free capacity a bit by uploading your photos.The updated plans will go live on the Dropbox site later tonight, and the process of converting all those paid users plans is expected to run until tomorrow morning. In the meantime though, existing Dropbox users will be given a free Pro 100 trial to spread around in an attempt to convert their friends and family to the ways of the cloud.
