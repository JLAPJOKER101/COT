CAIRO &mdash; A Libyan woman who became a symbol of her country&rsquo;s repression after security forces tried to silence her accusations that Qaddafi militiamen had raped her said on Monday that she had escaped to neighboring Tunisia.        

The woman, Eman al-Obeidy, told CNN on Monday that a defecting soldier and his family had driven her in a military car to a rebel-held border crossing last Thursday; she hid her face behind a traditional head covering, she said, and crossed the border as a refugee. She said she continued to fear pursuit by agents working for Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi and hoped to find protection from a Western government.        

&ldquo;I still do not know what I am going to do,&rdquo; she told CNN. &ldquo;Of course, I&rsquo;d like to see my family.&rdquo;        

Ms. Obeidy was a resident of Tripoli whose family lives near Benghazi, the center of the rebellion challenging Colonel Qaddafi&rsquo;s iron grip on Libya, and her family origin may have been one reason she was stopped at an armed checkpoint around Tripoli more than a month ago.        

On March 26 she broke into a Tripoli hotel full of journalists, saying she had been held for days and repeatedly raped by the Qaddafi militiamen who stopped her. Qaddafi agents who had previously appeared to be hotel staff members joined official press monitors in a chaotic scuffle with journalists in an attempt to apprehend and silence her.        

She was ultimately dragged from the hotel, but television footage of the melee brought attention to her case across Libya and around the world.        

Libyan government officials and state television attacked her character, charging that she was a prostitute and a thief who had refused a forensic medical exam. After her release from police custody, she told television interviewers that she was detained in Tripoli.
