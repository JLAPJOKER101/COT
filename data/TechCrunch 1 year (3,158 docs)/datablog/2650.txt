Kiwi Crate, a new subscription service for kids activities, has raised $2 million in funding led by First Round Capital.  Additional investors in the company include the Mayfield Fund, Comcast Ventures, Felicis Ventures, Forerunner Ventures, Consigliere Brand Capital, UJ Ventures and 500 Startups.  Individual angel investors include Raymond Tonsing and Seth Goldstein. The company, which launched today, has developed a subscription-based service that produces and delivers hands-on activities boxes for kids. The products are science activities, and arts and crafts projects that are designed to be educational but also entertaining for kids. And Kiwi Crate provides all the necessary materials, ideas and instructions for themed activities. Kiwi Crates monthly subscriptions are $19.95 per month, or $220 for an annual subscription. Gift subscriptions for 3, 6 or 12 months are also available.  The startup says each crate is designed by a community of parents, reviewed by team of experts, and tested by kids. Kiwi Crates founding team comes with extensive experience in e-commerce and childrens services. Founder Sandra Oh Lin was GM of eBay Fashion and prior to that, launched PayPal Mobile and led product marketing for PayPal’s Merchant Services business. Other co-founders include Yu Pan, a PayPal co-founder and early employee at You Tube, and Yael Pasternak Valek, an ex-Yahoo! product manager who was on the founding team at Maya’s Mom, which was later acquired by BabyCenter. Kiwi Crate faces competition from BabbaCo.
