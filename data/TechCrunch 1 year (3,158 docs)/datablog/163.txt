BaubleBar, a startup that promises high-quality jewelry at affordable prices, has raised a $4.5 million Series A round of funding from Accel Partners and Greycroft Partners.The round was reported this morning in PandoDaily. Co-founder Daniella Yacobovsky confirmed the funding via email (and said the round actually closed in April).BaubleBar says that it tries to tackle two of the big pain points in jewelry shopping â€” selection and price. The company gets its products directly from designers, with new products introduced every Tuesday and Thursday, and new collections chosen by the companys fashion team unveiled every Monday and Wednesday. (Im, uh, not a big jewelry shopper, so Im going by what the BaubleBar website tells me.) By focusing on the web without having to build up an enormous inventory, BaubleBar is able to sell many of its items for less than $40, according to PandoDaily.BaubleBar previously raised a $1.1 million seed round led by Accel, with funding from Founder Collective, Lerer Ventures, and various angels.
