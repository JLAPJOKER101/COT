BEIJING &mdash; Police officers fired tear gas at hundreds of protesters in Haimen city in southeastern China on Friday as a huge protest against the expansion of a coal-fired power plant persisted for a fourth day.        

In an apparent effort to deter protesters, the authorities showcased two handcuffed and seemingly remorseful demonstrators on local television, Reuters news service reported. Other clips featured legal experts who warned that those who joined in protests could face up to five years in prison.        

The videos underscored the difficulty authorities have had in controlling the demonstrations, which began Tuesday when thousands of people mobbed a government office and blocked a freeway in anger over the power plant.        

Local officials offered to temporarily suspend the expansion, but demonstrators have demanded that plans for the new plant be scrapped altogether. Other protesters are calling for the police to release protesters detained earlier in the week.        

Residents of Haimen, a city of about 120,000 that is part of the major Pacific port of Shantou, complain that existing coal-fired plants have already polluted the air, spurred a rise in cases of cancer and damaged the local fishing industry.        

Riot police officers had used tear gas on previous days of protest. On Friday, The Associated Press reported, their targets included Haimen town elders, who were kneeling on a road, burning incense and praying for the police to release detainees.        

It was unclear how many protesters were seized by the police. The state-run Xinhua news service reported Thursday that five people had been detained on vandalism charges as of Wednesday.
