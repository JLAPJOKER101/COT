A woman who took the job of police chief in a border town riddled with drug gang violence has asked for asylum in the United States, officials said Tuesday. The woman, Marisol Valles Garc&iacute;a, who was 20 when she was named police chief of Pr&aacute;xedis G. Guerrero in October, left with her whole family, including her baby son, last week, said Gustavo de la Rosa Hickerson, a Chihuahua State human rights investigator. A spokeswoman for United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement confirmed that Ms. Valles Garc&iacute;a was in the United States.
