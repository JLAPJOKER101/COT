A house fire killed one of Zimbabwe&rsquo;s main political brokers, raising questions about the battle within President Robert Mugabe&rsquo;s party over who will succeed the ailing 87-year-old leader. The victim, Gen. Solomon Mujuru, 62, a former military chief and guerrilla leader, died in an overnight fire at one of his homes, the nation&rsquo;s army commander said Tuesday. General Mujuru led the military for more than a decade after independence in 1980. His wife, Vice President Joice Mujuru, and her supporters are vying for supremacy within the party should Mr. Mugabe die or retire, and she had counted on her husband&rsquo;s support.
