With Lavas XOLO X900 Intel is entering uncharted territory. Its the chip makers first major push into mobile phones. Intel revealed its new mobile strategy and upcoming hardware a few months back at Barcelonas Mobile World Congress. Since then Lavas XOLO X900 has not changed. Its still destined for just India. Its still a mid-tier Android 2.3 phone (ICS is coming) with a 4.03-inch, HSPA+ 3G phone. But Intels inside and thats a big deal.Inside the average looking X900 is Intels Atom Z2460 processor. This is the first of several upcoming phones that forgo the tradition ARM-based CPU for Intels Atom X2460. Intel designed this Atom SoC with Android specifically in mind. The chip runs at a competitive 1.6GHz and features Intels hyper-threading, 400MHz graphics core with support for OpenGL, ES2.0 and OpenVG. The silcon also had a dedicated imaging core that supports throughput of up to 240 megapixels per second and a 10-picture burst mode  a key selling point of the XOLO X900.This is just a test for Intel, though. The company is launching this device in only India. A similar but slightly more powerful handset will hit China later this year. Intel is using these fast-moving markets as a test bed of sorts. If found to be successful, Intel will no doubt look to other OEMs for the slower moving, but more lucrative markets of Europe and the US. Until then, Indian buyers will have Intel smartphones all to themselves.Lavas XOLO X900 will hit Indian retailers on April 23 for approximately 22,000 rupees, or about $420. Seeing how the iPhone 4S goes for twice as much in India, the XOLO X900s price should be enticing enough to convince at least some buyers to test Intels first generation device.
