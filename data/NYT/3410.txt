At least 15 insurgents were killed in a foreign helicopter attack on a Shabab rebel military base near Kismayo, Somalia, witnesses and officials said Friday. The attack, which occurred on Thursday, killed at least 15 Shabab commanders, including eight foreigners, a local human rights organization said. It was not clear who carried out the attack. American Special Operations forces have attacked Somali militants by helicopter at least once before.
