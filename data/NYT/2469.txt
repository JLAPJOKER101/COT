RABAT, Morocco (Reuters) &mdash; The chief suspect in the bombing last week of a popular tourist cafe in Marrakesh, Morocco, had disguised himself as a guitar-carrying &ldquo;hippie&rdquo; before he planted the two bombs, killing at least 17 people, an official said Friday.        

The suspect, identified as Adel al-Othmani, walked into the cafe wearing a wig and carrying a guitar and the two bags in which he had hid the explosive devices, the official said. &ldquo;He looked like a hippie,&rdquo; said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The official said the man ordered an orange juice and left the cafe without the bags. &ldquo;He used a mobile phone to detonate the bombs afterward,&rdquo; the official said.        

An Interior Ministry spokesman could not be reached for comment.        

On Thursday, the ministry announced the arrest of three Moroccans in connection with the attack on April 28 in the bustling Djemma el Fna square. The ministry said the chief suspect had links to Al Qaeda.        

Eight French tourists were among those killed in the attack.        

The attack in Marrakesh adds to the challenges facing King Mohammed as he tries to prevent political uprisings similar to those elsewhere in the Arab world. Morocco is usually considered a haven of stability in a volatile region, but demonstrators demanding expanded democratic freedoms and a change of government have mounted protests in recent weeks. They were joined last weekend by trade union members.
