JERUSALEM (AP) &mdash; The United States restored financing to international aid groups in Gaza on Sunday, an American official said, after leaders of Hamas, the Palestinian political group that controls the territory, apparently backed away from demands that the groups allow Hamas to audit their financial records.        

The State Department sent a message to Hamas on Thursday through an intermediary, warning that the United States would withdraw about $100 million it is spending in Gaza on health care, agriculture and water supplies if Hamas did not drop its demands. The official who spoke to The Associated Press on Sunday said after Hamas ignored the warning, the United States &ldquo;paused&rdquo; its financing for the aid groups.        

United States policy forbids American groups working in Gaza from having any direct contacts with Hamas, which the State Department classifies as a terrorist organization.        

The Hamas minister of planning in Gaza, Mohammed Awad, said the Gaza office of one of the groups, the International Medical Corps, reopened Sunday after it was briefly closed for rejecting the Hamas demand to search its offices and audit its books.
