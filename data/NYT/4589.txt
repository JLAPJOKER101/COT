A Chinese court sentenced two more Tibetan monks to long prison terms on Tuesday, accusing them of &ldquo;intentional homicide&rdquo; in the death of another monk, who immolated himself last March, according to Xinhua. The court sentenced Tsering Tenzin and Tenchum of the Kirt Monastery in the Tibetan area of Sichuan Province to 13 and 10 years in prison, respectively. On Monday, the same court found a 46-year-old monk, Drongdru, guilty of &ldquo;intentional homicide&rdquo; in the death of the monk, a 16-year-old who was his nephew and disciple. Prosecutors said that after the teenager immolated himself, the three monks hid him and delayed emergency treatment. Human rights groups said the teenage monk was protesting government policies in Tibet.
