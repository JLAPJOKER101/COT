KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) &mdash; Three members of the United States-led military coalition were killed Wednesday in Afghanistan, NATO said.        

The coalition said two died in a roadside bombing in southern Afghanistan, where foreign forces are trying to hold the ground they seized from Taliban insurgents in major offensives over the past year.        

Another died in eastern Afghanistan in an episode that was not related to combat.        

No other details were disclosed, pending notification of the service members&rsquo; relatives.        

So far this year, 328 foreign troops have been killed in Afghanistan. Last year, 404 died in the first seven months of the year.
