Weve been tracking the twists and turns of the Dropbox mega funding round feeding frenzy for over a month now. In July Sarah Lacy wrote that theyd be raising $200 million to $300 million at a $5 billion or higher valuation. A week ago MG Siegler wrote that the auction process was over and Dropbox was considering bids as high as $10 billion.The company has now chosen which investors will lead and participate in the round, weve heard from one of our sources. The final valuation will be less than $6 billion, and weve heard that the original estimates of a $200 million  $300 million round are still accurate. We do not yet know whos leading the round or otherwise participating, but that information will probably become available soon.In the end Dropbox didnt choose the investor with the highest valuation bid, weve heard. Look for the round to close and be announced in the coming weeks.
