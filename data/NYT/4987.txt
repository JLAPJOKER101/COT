The lower house of Congress has approved the creation of a Truth Commission charged with investigating human rights abuses, including those committed during the 1964-1985 military dictatorship. The Chamber of Deputies approved the government proposal late Wednesday to create a commission that will &ldquo;examine and clarify&rdquo; rights violations between 1946 and 1988, during which Brazil saw several periods of authoritarian rule. The measure would be a significant step in the effort to bring dictatorship-era abuses to light in Brazil, which has largely avoided formal discussion of the topic and never sentenced anyone for political crimes carried out during military rule. The bill will now go to the Senate.
