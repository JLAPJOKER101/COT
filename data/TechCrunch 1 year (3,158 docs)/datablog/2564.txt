Poor RIM. They just cant catch a break. Just two days after the official unveiling of their new BBX platform (the companys last bullet, so to speak), theyre already having legal papers thrown in their face.As it turns out, the BBX name (while rather fitting, given that its a merger of BlackBerryOS and QNX) wasnt free for the taking. BASIS International, a software development company out of New Mexico, claims the trademark is theirs and that theyre willing to fight for it.BASIS Internationals claim to the trademark lays in a product called BBx (short for Business BASIC eXtended), which theyve been building since 1985 as an interpreter for the Business BASIC programming language. Never heard of it? Dont worry — youre not the only one.BASIS International isnt filing their lawsuit just yet. They say theyve given RIM until October 31st to respond to a cease and desist, essentially requesting that RIM stops using BBX immediately (read: they wont.) And if RIM doesnt comply? The company says theyll take the next logical legal step.Meanwhile, RIM tells Reuters that they havent received the complaint — and even once they do, they see no problem. We do not believe the marks are confusing, particularly since our respective companies are in different lines of business.
