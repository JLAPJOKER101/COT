BountyJobs, which operates an online marketplace that connects corporate recruiters with a  network of headhunters, this morning announced it has secured $5 million in funding from existing investors.The financing round was led by Greylock Partners with the London offices of Accel Partners and RPM Ventures participating.BountyJobs currently boasts a marketplace of more than 10,000 pre-approved headhunters across the United States. Once employers are cleared to post job descriptions on the Web application, they can do so along with the fees they are willing to pay for successful hires (hence the company name).Headhunters, in turn, request permission to work on each job.BountyJobs chief exec Mike Hard says the additional capital will allow the company to expand software and services support for existing and future clients that regularly hire through contingent search agencies.
