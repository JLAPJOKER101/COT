Iran expects to make a final decision by late August in the case of three Americans charged with espionage, the official news agency IRNA said on Tuesday. The agency quoted Tehran&rsquo;s chief prosecutor, Abbas Jafari Dowlatabadi, as saying that the next court date in the case is set for the court&rsquo;s summer session from June 22 to Aug. 22 and that officials &ldquo;are hopeful&rdquo; a final decision will be made during that time. The three Americans &mdash; Shane M. Bauer, Josh F. Fattal and Sarah E. Shourd &mdash; were detained in July 2009 along the Iran-Iraq border. The two men remain in custody; Ms. Shourd, Mr. Bauer&rsquo;s fianc&eacute;e, was released last year on $500,000 bail and has refused to return to Iran for trial. The three deny the accusations. The trial had been scheduled to resume May 11, but the session was called off. Mr. Dowlatabadi said the delay resulted from a lack of coordination.
