Sorry, Verizon: looks like your exclusivity on the Motorola Droid RAZR might not last all that long. Based on the finer details of some docs pulled fresh from the good ol FCC, it looks like AT&T might be getting a RAZR of their very own.At first glance, theres not much to be gleaned. The device is constantly referred to as the IHDP56ME2 or M0C2E, rather than OMG AT&T RAZR LOOK! or anything along those lines. It does have all of AT&Ts radio bands (GSM 850/1900 and WCDMA Bands II/V for 3G) â€” but how do we know this thing is actually a RAZR? The devil is in the details.You see, Motorola had to design a brand new battery for the Droid RAZR. As their first Android phone with a non-removable cover, the Droid RAZRs battery needed to be wider and flatter than those theyd built before. They built this new battery and lovingly dubbed it the SNN5899A.And hey, whatdya know: as noted by the guys at WirelessGodness, this mystery handset also happens to use the SNN5899A. Given the legacy of the original RAZR, it only makes sense to get it on as many carriers as possible. Remember the original RAZR? That thing was on every carrier imaginable. You could have started a wireless carrier in your basement and offered the RAZR by the end of the week. AT&T will obviously avoid using the Droid half of the Droid RAZR name (Droid = Verizons branding), but Id be surprised to see them drop the other half.The documents of note can be found here.
