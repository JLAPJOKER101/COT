The Committee to Protect Journalists says an Ethiopian reporter has fled after being named in a diplomatic cable released by WikiLeaks, the first instance of a leaked cable causing direct repercussions for a journalist. The group said Wednesday that the reporter, Argaw Ashine, fled after being interrogated over the identity of a government source. Two government spokesmen denied the accusation.
