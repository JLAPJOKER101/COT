KINSHASA, Democratic Republic of Congo &mdash; Rejecting widespread criticism of the recent presidential election here, the incumbent, Joseph Kabila, said Monday that there was no reason to doubt he had been fairly re-elected.        

In a rare meeting with the news media, Mr. Kabila dismissed a weekend report by the Carter Center that said the election had not been credible because of tens of thousands of missing ballots and unrealistically high percentages of votes for Mr. Kabila.        

To reporters summoned to a serene riverside residence here, in a district well away from the capital&rsquo;s muddy streets and falling-down bungalows, Mr. Kabila calmly brushed off the challenge from both the Carter Center and his leading opponent, &Eacute;tienne Tshisekedi, who has also declared himself president.        

&ldquo;The credibility of these elections cannot be put in doubt,&rdquo; Mr. Kabila said, adding that he was &ldquo;definitely not concerned&rdquo; about findings by the Carter Center that, for instance, he had won virtually 100 percent of the vote in some districts.        

&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to go into the details of who voted,&rdquo; Mr. Kabila said. &ldquo;Am I uncomfortable with the results? No, not at all.&rdquo;        

Late Saturday, in the strongest expression so far of growing doubts among observers about the honesty of the Nov. 28 vote in one of the world&rsquo;s top mineral-producing nations, the Carter Center cited &ldquo;serious irregularities&rdquo; and &ldquo;mismanagement&rdquo; of results, saying it could not vouch for &ldquo;the degree to which they reflect the will of the Congolese people.&rdquo;        

But Mr. Kabila, who has been in power since 2001, suggested that the Carter Center, an American pro-democracy group, had overstepped boundaries. &ldquo;That N.G.O. has gone far beyond what was expected,&rdquo; he said Monday.        

Shortly afterward, the archbishop of Kinshasa, Cardinal Laurent Monsengwo Pasinya, echoed the Carter Center statement, saying official election results &ldquo;do not conform either to truth or to justice.&rdquo; During the vote, the Catholic Church deployed thousands of electoral observers all over this vast central African nation of 70 million.        

Others, including the European Union and the United States, have so far been largely silent about the election. Western companies have substantial mining interests here, and Mr. Tshisekedi, after a lifetime of radical-sounding statements, is not popular in overseas foreign ministries.        

What happens next in the electoral standoff is unclear. Mr. Tshisekedi&rsquo;s side has called for demonstrations to protest the proclamation of Mr. Kabila&rsquo;s re-election.        

On Monday, Kinshasa appeared to be returning to normal after a week of tension, deserted streets and shuttered businesses. Shops were open, and the city&rsquo;s monstrous traffic jams had resumed.        

Seated at a desk under a spreading tree, looking relaxed and with the broad Congo River flowing behind him, Mr. Kabila insisted Monday that there was no crisis in the country. Speaking in excellent English in this French-speaking country &mdash; he was raised partly in Tanzania &mdash; Mr. Kabila was dismissive of the longtime opposition leader&rsquo;s claims.        

&ldquo;I thought he was going to call me to congratulate me,&rdquo; Mr. Kabila said, smiling. But he issued a veiled warning to Mr. Tshisekedi: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll call on him to respect the laws of the land.&rdquo;        

Mr. Kabila also brushed aside questions about widely reported government corruption in Congo, saying it was a universal problem. &ldquo;Corruption exists anywhere and everywhere in the world,&rdquo; he said.        

At the end, the president got up from the desk, smiled and, as the reporters were dismissed, said, &ldquo;Well, they&rsquo;ve wasted my time.&rdquo;
