Cambodian and Thai troops battled for two hours Friday along a disputed stretch of their border, trading artillery fire that killed at least two people. Tensions between the countries have increased in recent days as Thai nationalists have staged protests in Bangkok urging the government to reclaim a patch of land near the 11th-century Preah Vihear temple, which belongs to Cambodia. One Thai villager and one Cambodian soldier were killed. Cambodia said four Thai soldiers were captured, a claim Thailand denied.
