Hop up out the bedturn my tablet on?Rapper Soulja Boy has released a branded tablet with Tokova called the Tiger Shark Soulja Boy Edition. The tablet has a 7 inch screen, runs on Android and the speakers go hammer.Pause for a second and ask yourself: would I rather have a tablet designed by Soulja Boy or Steve Jobs? Tough choice.Luckily, the Soulja Boy Edition is on sale for the very affordable price of $599, which just so happens to be the price of a 32GB WiFi iPad.I would love to know what goes through peoples heads when they buy something like this (if anyone has? Ever?).Like, what idea lost to this one in a Tokova strategy meeting? A Nicki Minaj smartphone that screeched Beez in the Trap at you every time you got a text?
