Youve just got to love the timing. First, Apple announces their education-focused media event smack dab in the middle of CES. Now, just as CES is winding down, Bloomberg has three people familiar with the product spilling purported details on the next iPad. Whether or not Apple won CES without even being there, theyre certainly trying.None of the leaked details are particularly new, but that it comes from Bloomberg and theyve seemingly got full confidence in their source(s) makes them a bit more credible than rumors prior.Heres the gist of it:The most curious bit? The use of the phrase high-def instead of Retina with regards to the display. If Apple was throwing around the Retina term internally, at least one of Bloombergs three sources presumably wouldve thought to mention it. If the sources mentioned it, Bloomberg would have squeezed it into the article somewhere â€” and they didnt. With leaks like this, whats not said can be as important as what is. Higher-res screen? Yes. But the absurdly high-resolution that a retina iPad would require (something like 2560 x 1920, higher than any monitor Apple has ever made regardless of size)? Probably not.
