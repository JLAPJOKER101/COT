An Italian man with extreme right-wing views opened fire in an outdoor market in Florence on Tuesday, killing two vendors from Senegal, then critically wounded three other Senegalese immigrants in another Florence market before killing himself, authorities said. The Florence prosecutor, Giuseppe Quattrocchi, said that as the police approached, the man, Gianluca Casseri, 50, shot himself in the head in an underground parking lot under the covered market of San Lorenzo, in the heart of the Tuscan capital. RAI state television said Mr. Casseri was known to the police for participating in racist marches by an extreme right-wing group. Many Senegalese work as vendors, selling scarves, wallets, belts, handbags and other items to locals and tourists near monuments in several Italian cities, including Florence and Rome.
