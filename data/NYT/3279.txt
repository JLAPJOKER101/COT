The United Nations Security Council voted Friday to treat Al Qaeda and the Taliban separately when it comes to sanctions, a move that is aimed at supporting the Afghan government&rsquo;s reconciliation efforts and that could help clear a path for negotiations with the Taliban. The American ambassador, Susan E. Rice, said the vote would send &ldquo;a clear message to the Taliban that there is a future for those who separate from Al Qaeda.&rdquo;
