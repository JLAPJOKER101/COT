User Hariprasanth sent us a strange missive: it seems that if you upload something to Google Docs today, your storage space immediately increases from 1GB to 5GB. I didnt believe him at first  it said 1GB as I was uploading  but immediately after the upload finished it read 5GB. Given everything we know about GDrive so far, including that it should launch with 5GB free storage and that the original Docs accounts were capped at 1GB, things look pretty good for an imminent release.As you recall, we have a copy of the GDrive app that was floating around and it still wont work with our current accounts. An ex-Googler tried the app and found he wasnt able to run it on his machine.If all of this is correct, services like Dropbox and Sugarsync had better batten the hatches.
