SANTIAGO, Chile (Reuters) &mdash; A Chilean Air Force plane disappeared on Friday near the Juan Fernandez islands in the Pacific Ocean with 21 people aboard and was presumed to have crashed, the authorities said.        

The defense minister, Andr&eacute;s Allamand, said the plane, a CASA 212, tried twice to land before it disappeared in the late afternoon. &ldquo;As it was approaching the island, it was declared missing after radio contact was lost,&rdquo; Mr. Allamand said, adding that search teams were heading to the area.        

Capt. Otto Mrugalski, who is directing search and rescue efforts, said no remains of the plane had been found around the islands, which lie about 420 miles off Chile&rsquo;s coast.        

The mayor of the islands, Leopoldo Gonzalez, told state television that passengers&rsquo; belongings had been found in the ocean about a half-mile from the airport&rsquo;s landing strip. A local radio station, Bio Bio, later cited Mr. Gonzalez as saying that a door of the plane had been found in the water.        

Felipe Paredes, who works in the control tower, said he saw the plane struggling to land and cited heavy winds and sporadic rain. &ldquo;When the plane was blown off course by the wind, it managed to pull up again,&rdquo; Mr. Paredes said. He said he then lost sight of the plane.        

TVN national television said five of its staff members were among the passengers, including an anchor, Felipe Camiroaga.
