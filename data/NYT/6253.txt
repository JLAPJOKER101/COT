Facing a Friday expulsion deadline, Iranian diplomats vacated Britain. Britain&rsquo;s Foreign Office, which ordered the expulsion and the closing of Iran&rsquo;s embassy after the attack on British diplomatic facilities in Tehran on Tuesday, said the Iranians had left in a chartered aircraft. The Iranian authorities, meanwhile, warned the European Union against elevating sanctions against Iran over its disputed nuclear program. They also denounced the Security Council for siding with Britain&rsquo;s protest of the embassy attack, which has reduced Iran-Britain relations to their lowest point in years. &ldquo;If you have just a bit of wisdom, you won&rsquo;t tie your rope to the rotten rope of Britain,&rdquo; the militant cleric Ayatollah Ahmad Khatami, above, warned the West in a speech at Tehran University, news agencies reported.
