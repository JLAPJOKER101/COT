The police shot and killed two anti-government protesters in Tanzania and arrested at least 10 leading opposition figures during a violent political demonstration, a senior police official said Thursday. The opposition leader Willibrod Slaa, who ran in last year&rsquo;s disputed presidential election, was among those detained and his Chadema party spoke of a deliberate crackdown on the opposition. The police arrested 49 people, including Chadema&rsquo;s chairman, Freeman Mbowe, and at least four opposition lawmakers. The detained opposition leaders were later charged with unlawful assembly and released on bail.        

Opposition leaders were protesting the election of a ruling party candidate as mayor of Arusha, an opposition stronghold, saying Chadema councilors were barred from voting. The arrest of Mr. Slaa, the main challenger to President Jakaya Kikwete, above, in an Oct. 31 presidential election marred by allegations of vote rigging, came days after he called for Mr. Kikwete&rsquo;s resignation. He demanded that Mr. Kikwete step down after a scandal over a power generation contract.
