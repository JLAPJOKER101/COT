Australia came under fire from United Nations agencies and human rights advocates on Friday over its plan to send unaccompanied child asylum seekers to Malaysia as part of a refugee swap. The two countries have reached an agreement in principle for Malaysia to take 800 asylum seekers from Australia in return for Australia&rsquo;s resettling 4,000 refugees from Malaysia. Immigration Minister Chris Bowen said the 800 would include children who made the boat journey without parents or guardians. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want children getting on boats to come to Australia thinking or knowing that there is some sort of exemption in place,&rdquo; he told the Australian Broadcasting Company. Unicef had been seeking assurances that children would not be sent to Malaysia, and its chief executive in Australia, Norman Gillespie, called the deal &ldquo;extremely callous and lacking in all forms of compassion.&rdquo;
