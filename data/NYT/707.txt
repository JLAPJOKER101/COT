MACAO &mdash; Long before words like &ldquo;multiculturalism&rdquo; and &ldquo;fusion cuisine&rdquo; entered the modern lexicon, Aida de Jesus and her forebears were mashing up food, language and DNA from far-flung corners of the globe.        

A 95-year-old chef whose ancestry is drawn from Goa, Malacca and other former outposts of the Portuguese empire, Senhora de Jesus, as she prefers to be called, grew up celebrating Christmas and Chinese New Year with meals that relied on Portuguese sausage, bok choy and galinha cafreal, a chicken dish with an African pedigree. She spoke Portuguese at school, Cantonese on the street and a lively creole known as Patu&aacute; with &ldquo;the girls.&rdquo;        

&ldquo;We Macanese are always mixing it up,&rdquo; Senhora de Jesus said with a giggle, speaking in English, as she sat in the restaurant her family has run for decades. &ldquo;We are very adaptable.&rdquo;        

But these days the Macanese &mdash; as this former Portuguese colony&rsquo;s mixed-race residents are called &mdash; are swimming against a demographic tide that threatens to subsume their rich cultural cocktail. Always outnumbered by the Chinese migrants and Portuguese traders who crammed into this densely settled speck in the Pearl River Delta, the Macanese who stayed after Beijing took back the territory in 1999 are decidedly in the minority. Fewer than 10,000 Macanese reside here; by contrast, Macao&rsquo;s population of 500,000 is about 95 percent Chinese and rising.        

&ldquo;There  are probably more Macanese living in California and Canada than Macao,&rdquo; said Miguel de Senna Fernandes, a lawyer and playwright whose father,  something of a local cultural institution, chronicled the lives of  ordinary Macanese in a series of novels. &ldquo;Now that we are part of China, we are facing a very absorbing, overpowering force.&rdquo;        

Not that Mr. Fernandes is giving up. In addition to organizing social events through his group, the Macaenses Association, he has also emerged as the Don Quixote of Patu&aacute;, which is listed by Unesco as an endangered language. He helped publish a dictionary of Patu&aacute; expressions, and for the past 18 years he has staged an annual play that revives what local people call &ldquo;doci papia&ccedil;am,&rdquo; or sweet speech, a stew of archaic Portuguese, Malay and Singhalese spiced with English, Dutch and Japanese, and more recently, a large helping of Cantonese.        

Mr. Fernandes, 50, traces his fascination with Patu&aacute; to his grandmother, who would slip into it when gossiping with friends during &ldquo;ch&aacute; gordo,&rdquo; or fat tea, a typically Macanese interpretation of English high tea whose overabundance of Malaysian noodles, codfish fritters and custard tarts explains the fat.        

&ldquo;Drawn by their laughter, I would hide in the corner and later ask my grandmother about expressions I&rsquo;d never heard before,&rdquo; he said. More often than not they were unsuitable for an 8-year-old&rsquo;s ears but his grandmother would oblige with sanitized translations, followed by an admonishment to stick to studying proper Portuguese.        

&ldquo;The old-timers considered Patu&aacute; broken or bad Portuguese,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but since then I&rsquo;ve been hooked.&rdquo;        

The language is among the last of the creoles that once flourished in the constellation of ports that made up Portugal&rsquo;s Asian and African holdings. Unlike British colonizers who maintained some distance from their subjects in Hong Kong, just an hour&rsquo;s ferry trip from Macao, the Portuguese frequently married local women who then converted to Catholicism.        

Alan Baxter, a linguist at the University of Macao and an expert on Portuguese-based creoles, said the roots of Patu&aacute; extend back to the 16th century, when Portuguese traders and their camp followers did business with Africans, Indians and Malays, then sailed onward to other colonies in the empire.        

&ldquo;Imagine if you went somewhere new and were deprived of knowledge of a local language and merely picked up the useful bits you heard to get yourself fed,&rdquo; he said, explaining its evolution.        

The Cantonese contributions to Patu&aacute; came much later, starting in the late 19th century, after the walls dividing Macao&rsquo;s Portuguese and Chinese quarters were torn down and the two groups began to mingle.        

These days Macanese give their laundry to a &ldquo;mainato&rdquo; &mdash; from the southern Indian language Malayalam &mdash; and they address their beloveds as &ldquo;amo chai,&rdquo; a mix of the Portuguese &ldquo;amor&rdquo; and the Cantonese expression for &ldquo;little one.&rdquo; Verbs are unconjugated, nouns are repeated to suggest the plural and words are sometimes assembled in a way that mimics the structure of classic Chinese idioms.
