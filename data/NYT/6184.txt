A court in North Darfur sentenced to death seven people accused of being members of the rebel Justice and Equality Movement, state media said Monday. The report did not spell out the charges, but said the case was related to an attack on a military convoy traveling from Khartoum to Nyala, the capital of South Darfur State, that killed dozens of soldiers.
