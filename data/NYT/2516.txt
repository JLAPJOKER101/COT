MEXICO CITY (AP) &mdash; Mexican marines patrolling a lake along the border with Texas discovered a drug gang&rsquo;s island camp, provoking a gun battle that left 13 people dead, the Mexican Navy said Monday.        

And in a different northern state, investigators reported finding 11 decapitated bodies.        

In the gunfight, which took place on Sunday, one marine and 12 men suspected of being members of the Zetas drug cartel were killed on Falcon Lake in the northeastern state of Tamaulipas, the navy said in a statement.        

The navy said the gunmen opened fire when the marines discovered the camp, which the gang is believed to have used as a launching point for smuggling marijuana into Texas by speedboat.        

The decapitated bodies of 11 men were found Monday in two places in Durango, the state attorney general&rsquo;s office said.
