Local Response, a social advertising platform that allows local businesses to respond to the check-in with marketing campaigns, is launching a pro version of its analytics and action platform for marketers.LocalResponses DirectResponse product aggregates real-­time social media check-­‐ins from Facebook, Twitter, Foursquare, Instagram and dozens of other services to provide a simple interface for local businesses to directly respond to their most influential and valuable customers. What makes LocalResponse compelling is that it analyzes massive amounts of data in addition to check-ins from the Twitter firehose, photo sharing sites and more to find other forms of check-ins.

Average clickthrough-rates for LocalResponse’s Intent Retargeting are 1%.The PRO Dashboard provides real-time analysis for brand’s and brand’s competitor’s consumer foot traffic, intent, and sentiment.
