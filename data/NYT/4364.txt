Laurent Gbagbo, the former president of Ivory Coast, and his wife, Simone &mdash; who have been detained since he was ousted in April &mdash; were charged this week with &ldquo;economic crimes, armed robbery, looting and embezzlement,&rdquo; the public prosecutor said Thursday. Mr. Gbagbo and his wife have been transferred from house arrest to jail. President Alassane Ouattara&rsquo;s government has been pursuing court cases against members of the former government suspected of killing civilians seen as pro-Ouattara during and after a disputed November election, and of looting the treasury to remain in power despite Western sanctions.
