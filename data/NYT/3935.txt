DAKAR, Senegal &mdash; Thousands filled a sandy plaza here Saturday to demonstrate against Senegal&rsquo;s president, Abdoulaye Wade, who is trying to extend his time in office in what critics say is a violation of the country&rsquo;s Constitution.        

The attempt by the 85-year-old president has unleashed a wave of protests, some violent, in a poor West African nation that alone among its neighbors has a long tradition of relative democracy. There has never been a coup d&rsquo;etat in this former French colony, and the speakers at Saturday&rsquo;s rally urged Mr. Wade to respect the country&rsquo;s record and to step down immediately.        

The opposition press and politicians here routinely accuse Mr. Wade &mdash; a remote, acerbic figure who spent a lifetime in opposition politics before his peaceful election in 2000 &mdash; of trying, as many of his peers in this part of the world have done, to stay in his sumptuous colonial-era presidential palace until his death.        

&ldquo;The countdown has begun, and we&rsquo;re going to keep up the pressure until Abdoulaye Wade leaves,&rdquo; one of the president&rsquo;s former prime ministers, Mack Sall, who has joined the protesters, told the cheering, densely packed crowd in the palm-fringed Place de l&rsquo;Obelisque. &ldquo;We say no to the violation of the Constitution!&rdquo; Mr. Sall yelled, as people held up signs, some using language imitating that from the protests in North Africa this year. One sign read: &ldquo;Wade, give it up, you are 100 years old.&rdquo; (The president is widely believed to be older than his official age.)        

Buses later brought in thousands of pro-Wade supporters to a counterdemonstration.        

Mr. Wade, first elected for seven years, was re-elected in 2007 for five more years after a change in the laws shortened the presidential term. His supporters argue that the change gives him the right to run for a third term next year despite a two-term limit. The critics say he is violating the spirit of the Senegal Constitution and the country&rsquo;s record as a continental bastion of democracy.        

&ldquo;The president is doing whatever he wants, and he is not respecting the Constitution,&rdquo; said one demonstrator, Serigne Touray Faye, who works in a car-rental agency. Like the others on Saturday, he had been forced to protest in a neighborhood at the edge of this bustling metropolis&rsquo;s center after Mr. Wade&rsquo;s interior minister last week banned demonstrations downtown. Trucks filled with armed soldiers dotted the capital on Saturday. In last month&rsquo;s protests, some national electricity company offices were burned; power cuts lasting hours and sometimes days are a major grievance here.        

The earlier protest forced Mr. Wade to back off a proposed change that would have given him victory with only 25 percent of the vote, however.        

&ldquo;This is a cry from the heart,&rdquo; said Djily Aidara, one of Saturday&rsquo;s protest leaders and a founder of a prominent local rap group Y en a Marre (&ldquo;We are Fed Up&rdquo;) .&ldquo;We&rsquo;re fed up with their games. We say no to corruption. Senegal doesn&rsquo;t belong to any single politician.&rdquo;
