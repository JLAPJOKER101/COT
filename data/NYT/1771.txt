President Felipe Calder&oacute;n appointed Mexico&rsquo;s top prosecutor against organized crime, Marisela Morales, left, to be attorney general, which would make her the country&rsquo;s first woman in that post if approved by the Senate. The departing attorney general, Arturo Ch&aacute;vez Ch&aacute;vez, resigned after less than two years, during which he was accused of being ineffective in fighting the powerful drug cartels.
