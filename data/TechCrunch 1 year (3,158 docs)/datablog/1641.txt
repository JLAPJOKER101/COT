Do you believe in a thing called love? If not, just listen to the rhythm of my heart Or head on over to AT&Ts website to pre-order the Galaxy Note. If for some reason you dont remember, the Note is a 5.3-inch phone/tablet hybrid that showed its face in a costly Samsung commercial during last nights Super Bowl. Its claim to fame would be a little stylus, what Samsung is calling the S-Pen, which makes the Note a tad more useful when youre in a pinch and need to jot down a note or something quick like that. Samsung has started out the year with 1 million Galaxy Note sales under its belt. If you feel like getting touchy-feely (touching youuuuou, touching meeeee) then you also have the option of sauntering into an AT&T come February 19 and settling the decision then and there. The Galaxy Note will cost you $300 on-contract.
