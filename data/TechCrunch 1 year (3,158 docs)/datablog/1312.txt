		
Trey Ratcliff, the travel photographer known for popularizing HDR (high dynamic range) photo techniques online through his very popular Stuck In Customs blog and more recently his own apps and Google+ page, was in his hometown of Austin, Texas this week as the South By Southwest Interactive conference descended on the city.But Ratcliff didnt avoid the SxSWi crowds like many native Austinites do. Instead, he teamed up with Google+ to host a photowalk that attracted hundreds of photo buffs keen to bring their online friendships into real life  it was an especially impressive turnout given the unseasonably chilly and rainy weather this past weekend. TechCrunch TV was there, and we were able to pull aside Ratcliff for an interview before the photowalk began. Watch the video above to hear Ratcliffs one piece of advice for casual photographers, why online social networks have been so good for photos, how his newest app Stuck On Earth is taking off, and his next big travel destination  hes moving to New Zealand next week.
