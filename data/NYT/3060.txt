PARIS &mdash; Claire Nini, now 25, was sexually assaulted as a teenager, and it took her seven years to file a complaint, she said, &ldquo;because I feared the notoriety of my assailant, a well-known doctor in Nice.&rdquo;        

But the furor around the arrest in New York on attempted rape charges of Dominique Strauss-Kahn, who had been considered a likely next president of France, has given Frenchwomen and the modest feminist movement here a chance to speak out against sexual oppression and push for a less chauvinistic relationship between the sexes.        

&ldquo;I hope this is going to help the victims to speak,&rdquo; Ms. Nini said. &ldquo;If D.S.K.,&rdquo; the initials by which Mr. Strauss-Kahn is known here, &ldquo;is really guilty, I think this affair is going to help women,&rdquo; she said. But if he is found not guilty, she said, &ldquo;there is a risk that women will not be taken seriously anymore.&rdquo;        

Mr. Strauss-Kahn, the former chief of the International Monetary Fund, was arraigned on Monday in New York and pleaded not guilty to all charges, a four-minute event covered live by the main French television channels, Web sites and bloggers. There were experts and court drawings and shots of uniformed hotel workers shouting, &ldquo;Shame on you!&rdquo;        

The case has also sharpened the debate here about a French way of life, one of tolerance for a male-centric attitude in gender relations, an acceptance of all but the most egregious sexual assaults on women and a reluctance by the authorities to intervene, particularly in cases involving the powerful.        

&ldquo;This is a key moment, a watershed moment,&rdquo; said Anne-Elisabeth Moutet, an analyst of French politics and culture. Women from across the political spectrum &ldquo;have extremely unpleasant stories to tell, that men think women are all up for grabs, literally and figuratively,&rdquo; she said. France is &ldquo;a difficult country to budge,&rdquo; she added. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s an important step. Women are emboldened.&rdquo;        

One example of the habits of the past and of possible change inspired by the Strauss-Kahn case was the forced resignation of a junior minister, Georges Tron, who was accused by two women of pressing them to have foot massages that soon evolved into groping. The women said that they were encouraged to speak out by the arrest of Mr. Strauss-Kahn.        

President Nicolas Sarkozy, who has been known for his own roving eye, kept his glance on the politics of the matter, with a presidential election next year. He fired Mr. Tron within two days.        

Natacha Henry, a French writer and feminist who has written books about the sexuality of young women and about domestic violence, is writing a chapter for a book about the Strauss-Kahn case, concentrating on the more discreet sexual discrimination prevalent in French life.        

&ldquo;Women are starting to speak out now,&rdquo; Ms. Henry said. &ldquo;Strauss-Kahn&rsquo;s friends said he was always a womanizer, a &lsquo;dragueur,&rsquo; but we are saying that this is not about seduction, not about &lsquo;la drague,&rsquo; but about something else. This is not about sex, seduction, love or an equal relationship, but it is everything to do with power. A lot of attitudes that in America would be considered sexual harassment would be seen here as, &lsquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s so keen on women.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;        

She added: &ldquo;For the friends of D.S.K., feminism and equality hasn&rsquo;t entered their brains or their political culture. It&rsquo;s like they were building a sexual planet for themselves, without women.&rdquo;        

Viviane Meunier, a lawyer, noted an important effect. &ldquo;The simple image that any woman can report what she suffered, that her word can be taken seriously against a high-ranking public figure, is already enough to convey a message to all victims,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I do not think it will mark the birth of a new feminism, but it will contribute, I hope, to the long evolution of gender relations.&rdquo;        

For Ms. Moutet, the misuse of male power &ldquo;meets an echo everywhere,&rdquo; not just in politics or in the capital. She cited a 1990 film, &ldquo;Promotion canap&eacute;,&rdquo; a title that refers to a casting couch. &ldquo;It exists in the civil service, in companies, in the post office,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;This will definitely impact women, it will filter down.&rdquo;        

She and others pointed to interviews with nine female politicians published May 31 in the daily Lib&eacute;ration, under the headline, &ldquo;Sick of the machos.&rdquo; They described &ldquo;incredibly gross jokes&rdquo; in the National Assembly and feeling the need to wear trousers to make a speech. But some, like C&eacute;cile Duflot, leader of the Greens, noted that &ldquo;there is a quite sharp difference between people under 40 and those who are older,&rdquo; while Roselyne Bachelot, a minister, said that &ldquo;in 30 years of political and feminist engagement, of course I saw real transformations. But the battle is never won.&rdquo;
