Torrential rains killed at least six people in Genoa on Friday, in the worst flooding the port city has seen in years, officials said. Entire neighborhoods were blocked, as water swept through the city after several streams overflowed. Some victims, including three children, drowned when water rushed through the building where they had sought refuge.        

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;A weather warning had been in place for days. But Genoa&rsquo;s mayor, Marta Vincenzi, said that flash flooding of such proportions had been impossible to predict. &ldquo;It was like a tsunami,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Something we&rsquo;ve never seen in Genoa.&rdquo;
