A Moscow court on Monday refused a parole request by Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, the jailed former oil tycoon, citing a lack of proper paperwork. Having served half of his 13-year sentence for tax evasion, fraud and other crimes, Mr. Khodorkovsky is eligible for parole under Russian law. He and his business partner, Platon Lebedev, who is serving time for similar charges, filed parole requests last week. The requests were returned because the court received &ldquo;insufficient accompanying documents,&rdquo; a court spokeswoman told the Interfax news agency, without elaborating. Mr. Khodorkovsky was jailed in 2003 after clashing with Vladimir V. Putin, then the president and now the prime minister.
