A court in Thailand on Thursday sentenced an American citizen, Joe Gordon, to two and a half years in prison for defaming the country&rsquo;s royal family. Mr. Gordon, who was born in Thailand, had been accused of translating excerpts of a banned biography of King Bhumibol Adulyadej and then posting them online. Mr. Gordon, 55, pleaded guilty to the charges in October, and as a result a judge in Bangkok&rsquo;s criminal court reduced by half his proposed sentence of five years.
