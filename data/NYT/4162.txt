A World Food Program handout of corn rations to Somalis trying to survive a famine turned deadly Friday after government troops opened fire, killing at least seven people, witnesses said. Residents of a famine refugee camp in Mogadishu said soldiers started the chaos by trying to steal some of the food. Refugees joined in the scramble, prompting soldiers to open fire, the witnesses said. &ldquo;They fired on us as if we were their enemy,&rdquo; said Abidyo Geddi, a refugee. &ldquo;When people started to take the food, then the gunfire started and everyone was being shot. We cannot stay here much longer. We don&rsquo;t get much food, and the rare food they bring causes death and torture.&rdquo;
