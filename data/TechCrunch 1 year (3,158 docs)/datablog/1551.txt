If youre sick of firmware lockdowns and failed reflashings on your other Android tablets, the Auraslate may be for you. Its basically an Ice Cream Sandwich-compatible tablet built from the ground up for hax0rz and programmers alike.There are two models  the 7-inch 726B and the 10-inch 1026  and the 1026 can run the latest version of Android. You can upload any version you want, however, and even the hardware is open source in that you receive a hardware source disk for about $20 extra.To be clear, you wont be blazing through web pages on this thing or playing high-end video games. For about $130, you get a standard Android CORTEX A9 tablet from a Chinese OEM that you could get for about $95 if you really dug around. However, Auraslate is promising open source software updates for their hardware and you also get a support community and the source code. This sort of package is ideal if youre working on an Android hardware project, for example, as you will be able to talk with a community of hackers dealing with the same hardware and software rather than picking up a fly-by-night tablet from China and hoping it works.Auraslate just launched (thanks tipster!) so well have to wait and see how popular and useful the product becomes. However, as a tool for developers it seems that the founders hearts are in the right place.Product Page
