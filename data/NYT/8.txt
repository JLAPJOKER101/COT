President Omar Hassan al-Bashir made a rare public appeal on Friday to opposition parties to join a broad-based government just days ahead of a vote that will likely see the south move toward independence. A Jan. 9 referendum on secession for the oil-producing south has preoccupied Mr. Bashir&rsquo;s administration, based in the north in Khartoum, as the expected split would weaken his government. The state news agency SUNA quoted Mr. Bashir as calling for a &ldquo;broad-based government to unite the internal front.&rdquo; A senior official with the opposition Popular Congress Party, Kamal Omer, said: &ldquo;We totally reject this &mdash; the only solution now is for Bashir to resign, hold new elections and a forum to agree a new constitution,&rdquo; he said.
