In heavy fighting on Thursday, troops loyal to the strongman Laurent Gbagbo clashed for the first time with commandos claiming loyalty to his opponent, raising fears of a civil war. Previously, Mr. Gbagbo&rsquo;s troops had fought only unarmed protesters loyal to the challenger, Alassane Ouattara, left. &ldquo;It changes the game,&rdquo; said Hamadoun Tour&eacute;, a local United Nations spokesman. &ldquo;Before, it was clashes between police and protesters. Now if it&rsquo;s the beginning of fighting between two armed forces, it could have serious consequences for the country or even the region.&rdquo; A spokesman for Mr. Ouattara said the forces allied with him were defending themselves after repeated attacks by Mr. Gbagbo&rsquo;s forces, and had not been ordered to fight. He said 13 people were killed, including 12 pro-Gbagbo militiamen.
