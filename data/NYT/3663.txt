Responding to concerns raised by local rights groups and photojournalists, President Mikheil Saakashvili&rsquo;s administration denied Friday that the arrest this week of a group of photographers on suspicions of spying was made in retaliation for their journalistic work. Manana Manjgaladze, Mr. Saakashvili&rsquo;s spokeswoman, said the case &ldquo;is about a serious leakage of information from our institutions, not about journalism or media activities.&rdquo; A civil rights group, the Georgian Young Lawyers&rsquo; Association, asked the Interior Ministry to publicly justify the secrecy concerning the case. One of the four remaining detainees, Giorgi Abdaladze, a freelancer, has announced a hunger strike, according to his lawyer. The police released a fifth, a photographer for The Associated Press, early Thursday.
