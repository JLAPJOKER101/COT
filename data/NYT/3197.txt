Former President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali, who fled to Saudi Arabia in January, will be tried in absentia on June 20, Tunisia&rsquo;s interim prime minister said Monday. &ldquo;He will be tried in a military and in a civilian court,&rdquo; Prime Minister Beji Caid Sebsi said on Al Jazeera television. Mr. Ben Ali fled to Saudi Arabia on Jan. 14 after he was toppled by mass protests after 23 years in power. Tunisian authorities have been preparing several legal cases against him, including conspiring against the state, voluntary manslaughter and drug trafficking. Saudi authorities have not responded to an extradition request.
