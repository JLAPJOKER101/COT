Reuters says that its Bahrain correspondent has been expelled from the country amid a continuing crackdown on media in the Persian Gulf kingdom. The news agency said Tuesday that Frederik Richter, who had been based in Manama, Bahrain&rsquo;s capital, since 2008, was told to leave days after officials complained about the news agency&rsquo;s reporting. Bahrain has been rocked by waves of unrest as its largely Shiite populace demands greater freedoms and equal rights from the tiny island nation&rsquo;s Sunni rulers. But the royal family has crushed demonstrators with the help of Gulf forces led by neighboring Saudi Arabia and has jailed local journalists and others. Karim Fakhrawi, the founder of the opposition newspaper al-Wasat, died recently while he was in state custody.
