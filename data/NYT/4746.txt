Turkey said Thursday that it would escort aid ships to Gaza and would not allow a repetition of last year&rsquo;s Israeli raid that killed nine Turks. &ldquo;Turkish warships, in the first place, are authorized to protect our ships that carry humanitarian aid to Gaza,&rdquo; Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, left, said in an interview on Al Jazeera television. &ldquo;From now on, we will not let these ships be attacked by Israel, as happened with the Freedom Flotilla.&rdquo; He also said that Turkey had taken steps to stop Israel from unilaterally exploiting natural resources in the Mediterranean. An Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman, Yigal Palmor, said, &ldquo;This is a statement well worth not commenting on.&rdquo;
