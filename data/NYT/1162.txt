Speculation that former President Hosni Mubarak had departed Egypt for Saudi Arabia heightened Wednesday with a government-owned newspaper saying that he had gone late last week to a special Saudi military complex at Tabuk for chemotherapy treatment by his usual German doctors. He is suffering from pancreatic and colon cancer, it said.        

There was no official confirmation of the report.
