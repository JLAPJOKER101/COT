A military court in Democratic Republic of Congo on Thursday sentenced four police officers to death and jailed a fifth for life for killing a prominent human rights campaigner last year. The body of Floribert Chebeya, who headed Voice of the Voiceless, was found bound and gagged in the back of his car last June after he was called to a meeting with the head of the police, Gen. John Numbi, which never took place. General Numbi was suspended but was not charged in the case. His second-in-command, Daniel Mukalay, was one of those sentenced to death. Three of the policemen who are still at large were tried in absentia.
