The more we know about Apple, it seems, the less we really know. According to the journalist and writer Adam Lashinsky, Americas most admired company is also Americas least understandable company. And thats why he wrote Inside Apple  to reveal to the world how, as the subtitle of his book says, the Company Really Works.Apple, Lashinsky revealed to me when he came into our New York City studio earlier this week, is organized like a terrorist cell. Its a closed caste system, he explained, in which a few hand picked elites like Tim Cook and Scott Forstall collectively run the company without any input from ordinary employees. Apple encourages anything but an open or friendly culture, Lashinksy explained. It has what he calls, in Inside Apple, a confrontational workplace culture in which everyone is at each others throats. No prizes, of course, for guessing how Apple figured out the value of confrontation and why being at somebody elses throat is considered a virtue rather than a vice in Cupertino.This is the second and final part of my interview with Lashinsky. Yesterday, he explained to me why theres no free lunch at Apple and how Steves company has become the anti-Google of Silicon Valley.
