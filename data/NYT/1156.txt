Chancellor Angela Merkel appointed Thomas de Maizi&egrave;re, who has been interior minister since 2009, as Germany&rsquo;s defense minister. He replaces Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg, who resigned Tuesday over a plagiarism scandal. Mr. Maizi&egrave;re, 57, left, takes over the Defense Ministry at a time of upheaval: conscription is set to end in June, the army is cutting its troop levels to under 190,000 from over 250,000, and German forces will begin withdrawing this year from Afghanistan.
