BEIRUT, Lebanon &mdash; Syrian security forces killed at least 26 people on Wednesday across Syria, according to activists and residents, while defectors clashed with armed men loyal to the government of President Bashar al-Assad in central Syria.        

At least eight people were killed in the capital, Damascus, when soldiers fired at them as they were walking in the funeral procession of a protester who was killed Tuesday.        

Seven people were killed in Homs in central Syria, which has been under siege for more than a week.        

As the number of defectors from the Syrian Army increased, a United Nations official warned Wednesday of the prospect of civil war.        

&ldquo;Where basic human rights are trampled and peaceful demands for change met by brutal violence, people are eventually compelled to have recourse to rebellion against tyranny and oppression,&rdquo; the United Nations high commissioner for human rights, Navi Pillay, said Wednesday.
