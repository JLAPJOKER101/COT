A prominent human rights activist in Belarus was sentenced to four and a half years in prison after a trial for tax evasion that Western governments denounced as politically motivated. As head of the well-known rights group Vyasna, the activist, Ales Belyatsky, has provided legal assistance and moral support to opponents of Belarus&rsquo;s authoritarian president, Aleksandr G. Lukashenko. The authorities in Belarus opened a criminal case against Mr. Belyatsky after officials in Poland and Lithuania mistakenly handed over information about his financial accounts in those countries. Officials from both countries later apologized.
