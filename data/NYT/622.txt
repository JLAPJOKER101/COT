As President Robert Mugabe and his party, ZANU-PF, push for elections this year, political violence in Harare, the capital, and its impoverished suburbs &mdash; carried out by youths chanting ZANU-PF slogans &mdash; has surged in recent weeks, civic groups and independent journalists reported this week. Doctors said in a written account on Wednesday that they had treated nine supporters of Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai, Mr. Mugabe&rsquo;s rival. On Monday, they were assaulted with logs and stones and kicked by assailants wearing boots in Mbare, a suburb. Three of the victims were hospitalized with what the doctors described as &ldquo;grave injuries.&rdquo;
