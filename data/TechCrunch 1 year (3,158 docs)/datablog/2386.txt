BiteHunter, the new mobile app for finding nearby dining deals, has just completed a $800,000 funding round. The round was led by angel investors Avraham Kadar, M.D. and Eyal Chomsky. The funding will be used to provide additional resources for the development of new features, an expansion to other platforms, and ongoing maintenance of BiteHunters deals database.The app, sometimes described as a “Kayak for restaurants,” launched on iOS back in June, initially in New York, San Francisco and Chicago. In October, the company launched a major upgrade which included integration with hundreds more dining deals sources including Yelp Deals, Groupon Now and LivingSocial Instant. The newly added time-limited deals are now featured within the app’s new “BiteNow” section, showing you discounted dining options you can access on the go.With the new funding, BiteHunter says it will soon add a personalized deal recommendation notification system and the option for its users to purchase deals on the go, without having to register at all the different deal providers. BiteHunter plans to serve as the middleman between you and the deal you want, so you can purchase the deal in the mobile app with credit card information you have on file. The plan is for BiteHunter to house 70-80% of the deals in the U.S., BiteHunter CEO and Co-Founder Gil Harel told us recently.BiteHunter 1.3 is available here in iTunes.
