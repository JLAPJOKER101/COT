Bonobos, everyones favorite online clothing provider named after amorous monkeys, has announced a Cyber Pop-up Store featuring a number of special items curated by Nets basketball player Deron Williams with proceeds going to his charity.If that sounds like a lot of fluffy marketing, it is. However, the sale is one of the first self-described online pop-up stores and is designed to run from March 21 to April 21.Unlike traditional sales, the pop-up shop is based around Williams charity and style. More important, it drives folks to Bonobos who wouldnt traditionally be interested in buying slacks online. Win-win, as they say.With more eCommerce companies trying new and interesting methods to grab traffic  see Indochinos real world pop-up shops for another example  its clear much of the build-it-and-they-will-come attitude of the olden days is now falling away and more lifestyle companies are looking toward unorthodox methods to get folks clicking again.
