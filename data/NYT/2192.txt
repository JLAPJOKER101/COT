President Blaise Compaore appointed himself defense minister on Friday in a move aimed at quelling army dissent and popular unrest. Mr. Compaore fired his entire cabinet and top military brass last Friday, after a mutiny by soldiers in the capital. The troops, angry at not receiving promised benefits, have carried out a series of protests, and civilians have rioted over rising food prices. The opposition said it feared that Mr. Compaore&rsquo;s takeover of the Defense Ministry was a precursor to more authoritarian rule, and the main trade union vowed to hold further street protests if the government did not respond within days to its appeals for antipoverty measures.
