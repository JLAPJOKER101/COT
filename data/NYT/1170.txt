The director of the London School of Economics and Political Science has resigned over the institution&rsquo;s decision to accept research money from a son of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi. The director, Howard Davies, said he was stepping down because he recognized that the university&rsquo;s reputation had suffered because of its ties to Colonel Qaddafi. The money was donated to the school&rsquo;s Global Governance program by Seif al-Islam el-Qaddafi, who completed both a master&rsquo;s degree and a doctorate at the school. Mr. Davies said in a statement on Thursday that the decision to accept the money had &ldquo;backfired.&rdquo;
