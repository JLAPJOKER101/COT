Iran&rsquo;s finance minister survived a vote in Parliament on Tuesday to remove him from office over the country&rsquo;s banking scandal, the state-run Islamic Republic News Agency reported. More than two dozen lawmakers had submitted a motion to impeach the minister, Shamseddin Hosseini, an ally of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad who oversaw country&rsquo;s economy during the time Iranian authorities have said a record $2.6 billion banking fraud occurred. Mr. Ahmadinejad&rsquo;s conservative critics have tried to link his close associates to the alleged fraud. It was unclear what affect the vote would have on Parliament&rsquo;s request to summon Mr. Ahmadinejad himself for questioning.
