Textaholics, this ones for you. Swype  the Android-flavored keyboard that lets you type (or swype, rather) faster than you ever thought possible  has a present for you this holiday season. With Siri on the iPhone 4S, voice control apps are sprouting up faster than you can ask Siri about the meaning of life. Voice is where were headed and theres nothing anyone can do to stop it, so if you cant beat em, join em right? That said, Swype is launching a new beta with Nuances Dragon dictation built right in. Chances are the actual transcription isnt faster than your swypes, especially if youre a veteran Swype user, but when your hands are tied up Dragon should really come in handy. The app will also let you download a number of different languages. The only hang-up is if your phone came pre-loaded with the Swype keyboard. If so, the beta wont work and youll have to wait for the official version to get your Dragon on. Just visit Swypes site from your phone and register with an email address. Youll be sent a download link, and viola! Youre in business. I also have to give props to Swype for their promo video, which is as funny as it is clever. Check it out:[via SprintFeed]
