The government ordered Andrei Yurov, a Russian human rights activist, to leave the country on Thursday, a Belarussian rights group said. Mr. Yurov was detained Wednesday and released on Thursday morning, the human rights group Vesna-86 said. &ldquo;This is complete lawlessness,&rdquo; Mr. Yurov said, according to the group. Belarus has cracked down on dissent since a presidential election last December that Western monitors denounced as fraudulent.
