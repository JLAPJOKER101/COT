The authorities in a restive province in the southern Philippines on Wednesday defused five roadside bombs near the site of a 2009 massacre, as relatives of the 57 victims prepared to mark the second anniversary of the killings. No casualties were reported, and about 200 police officers were deployed to secure the site and the immediate vicinity. &ldquo;It looks like it&rsquo;s aimed at scaring away or inflicting casualties among those planning to attend the anniversary,&rdquo; said a military spokesman, Lt. Col. Leopoldo Galon.
