Its been only a month since SimpleGeo co-founder Joe Stumpleft his last company, following its acquisition by Urban Airship, but hes already launching a new product (and company) today called Sprintly. The company was actually founded in March by Stumps co-founder Graham Blache, and Stump tells me hes been plotting this product for nearly a decade. The startup is completely bootstrapped so far.Sprintly is a simple project management tool that is built for both software developers and other people in a company who rely on them. It is designed to remove the frustrations developers have with working in their own silo.Traditionally, programmers use bug tracking tools and the own product-management systems, only to be bugged incessantly by non-engineers about the status of new features or fixes. Sprintly gives the non-programmers a top-level view into what the engineers are doing and how far along they are. For the developers themselves, it gives them a drag-and-drop way for keeping track of projects.The approach reminds my of Trello, a project management service Joel Spolsky launched last September at Disrupt SF. The video demo below gives an overview of the service, which $9 per user per month after a one-month free trial.
