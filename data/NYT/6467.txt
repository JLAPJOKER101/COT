The Simon Wiesenthal Center has begun &ldquo;Operation Last Chance II,&rdquo; focused on finding and prosecuting remaining World War II Nazi war criminals who are still at large, the organization&rsquo;s chief Nazi hunter, Efraim Zuroff, said at a news conference in Berlin. The new project offers financial rewards of up to $32,900 for information leading to the prosecution and punishment of Nazi war crime suspects. The current drive to reopen hundreds of dormant investigations became possible after a legal precedent was set by the successful conviction of a former camp guard, John Demjanjuk, 91, in May.        

Mr. Demjanjuk was convicted by a German court of being an accessory to murder in 28,060 cases, the number of people who died during the time when he was a camp guard. The case was based on the theory that if Mr. Demjanjuk was working at a camp, his function as a guard automatically made him an accessory to the murders committed there. It was the first time prosecutors had made such a legal argument in German courts.
