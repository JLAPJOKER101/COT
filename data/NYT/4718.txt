Israeli security forces have arrested two people who are suspected of being Hamas militants and accused in a Jerusalem bombing that killed a British woman and wounded dozens of civilians this year, the country&rsquo;s Shin Bet security service said Wednesday. A 36-year-old Palestinian from the West Bank, who was accused of constructing the bomb, and a 23-year-old Palestinian from Jerusalem, accused of planting it next to a bus stop on March 23, were arrested. The bomb killed Mary Jean Gardner, a 59-year-old British tourist studying in Jerusalem, and wounded two dozen others, including five Americans.
