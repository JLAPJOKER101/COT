BEIJING &mdash; On the eve of a summit meeting between the presidents of China and the United States, Taiwan tested 19 missiles on Tuesday with mixed results.        

Six of the 19 air-to-air and surface-to-air missiles missed their mark. Taiwan&rsquo;s president, Ma Ying-jeou, was at the drill and said he was unhappy with the results, urging the military to improve its training. His presence and comments were an about-face for a leader who had said that Taiwan faced more of a threat from natural disasters than from China, with which he has been trying to improve ties.        

&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve been under a lot of criticism over the past year or two of bumbling on defense issues, of placating China,&rdquo; said Wendell Minnick, a correspondent for the publication Defense News. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re trying to show they&rsquo;re serious.&rdquo;        

China, which claims Taiwan as a province, has hundreds of missiles aimed at the island and has been modernizing its military, mostly with hardware imported from Russia, along with its own technology. Last week, China tested what it said was an advanced stealth fighter, a plane at least a generation ahead of Taiwan&rsquo;s air force, which is supplied by the United States.        

The timing of Taiwan&rsquo;s missile tests &mdash; a day before President Obama and President Hu Jintao of China were to meet in Washington &mdash; was widely seen as coincidental.        

Government officials in Taiwan said the dates for the exercise had been set before the timing of Mr. Hu&rsquo;s trip was known. But the tests are a reminder that Taiwan remains a problem for relations between the United States and China.
