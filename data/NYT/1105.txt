Marines have captured a regional commander for the Zetas drug gang, the navy said Monday, in the latest high profile arrest since the Feb. 15 attack that killed an American agent and wounded another. Jos&eacute; Luis Vergara, a navy spokesman, said the suspect, Sergio Antonio Mora, controlled the Zeta organization in the state of San Luis Potos&iacute;, where the attack on agents of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement took place. He said that Mr. Mora oversaw Julian Zapata Espinoza, also thought to be a Zeta member who was arrested last week and who, according to the authorities, confessed that he took part in the Feb. 15 ambush.
