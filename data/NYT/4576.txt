LASSAY-LES-CHATEAUX, France &mdash; Patrick Maignan, a robust gray-haired farmer, lives alone on his farm, surrounded only by the freshly plowed wheat fields of this lonely corner of northern France.        

Far from tourist routes and cellphone coverage, he works seven days a week, milking his 40 cows twice a day, sometimes breaking with routine by taking classes in traditional Breton dances or chatting with women on the Internet.        

Divorced in 1996, Mr. Maignan, 51, had given up hopes of finding another mate. &ldquo;When women knew I was a farmer,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;they fled.&rdquo; The loneliness of the farming life is a major issue for France, whose inhabitants worship the land but prefer to live in the city.        

But then Mr. Maignan found Claire Chollet, a 49-year-old director of human resources, on atraverschamps.com, or &ldquo;acrossthefields.com,&rdquo; an online dating site reserved for farmers like himself.        

Mr. Maignan said he now plans to marry Ms. Chollet, a divorced Parisian mother of two, and buy a house together in the village nearby.        

Atraverschamps.com is one of a handful of online dating sites devoted to &ldquo;rural people,&rdquo; farmers and others who live in the countryside or wish to find their soulmates there. Luc Gagnon, who founded atraverschamps.com in 2001, said that it nearly doubled its number of subscribers in the past year to 17,287, while other sites like vachement.fr, have had an average of 1,200 hits a day in the past year.        

&ldquo;There is now an entire economy based on the farmer&rsquo;s single status,&rdquo; said Bertrand Blond, the founder of vachement.fr.        

Many farmers were encouraged to join dating sites such as vachement.fr, Mr. Blond said, by the success of a weekly reality show called, with mild double-entendre, &ldquo;L&rsquo;Amour Est Dans Le Pr&eacute;,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Love is in the field.&rdquo;        

The show, first broadcast on the popular M6 channel in 2006, explores the life of 14 single farmers asked to pick a partner among a list of fans. On a recent Monday, the show was watched by 6.2 million people, about twice as many people as watched other popular shows in that time slot.        

Mr. Maignan, the farmer, says he&rsquo;s a regular viewer of the show, though he insists that &ldquo;it caricatures farmers.&rdquo; While &ldquo;it certainly raised awareness on the problems of farm life,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the farmers behave like actors.&rdquo;        

The lack of love in the countryside is a serious topic for a country that sees its bedrock in small farmers and their produce, which is supposed to be uniquely of the place where it is grown. According to the Agriculture Ministry, about 30 percent of male French farmers did not have a partner in 2009.        

Loneliness is particularly acute among male farmers between 18 and 35, especially cattle farmers, who generally spend more time working than other farmers. About 36 percent of cattle farmers were single in 2009, according to the ministry.        

The problem is worsening, said Fran&ccedil;ois Purseigle, an agriculture professor and expert in rural sociology. &ldquo;It will undoubtedly amplify in the coming years,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all the more strange that we don&rsquo;t think of it as a lonely profession.&rdquo;        

The expansion of online dating for farmers fills a need, he said. &ldquo;French farmers have more difficulties than others in coping with single life,&rdquo; Mr. Purseigle said, citing the values of the countryside, which is relatively conservative, often deeply religious and attached to traditional values like family and land.        

Until World War II, French farmers were considered the foundation of the French republic. The state celebrated and protected them, and unmarried farmers were supported by their families and fully integrated in the life of their village.        

But with extensive industrialization, farmers have been more marginalized and the career is less attractive, even with extensive French and European Union subsidies. Mr. Maignan, for example, always left his profession blank when he filled in his profile on regular dating Web sites.        

The rise in the number of single farmers has coincided with a declining number of farms; widespread rural depopulation, with many young people moving to the cities; and the introduction of modern farming methods and machines. The national idea of the patriotic, deeply republican, close-to-the-soil farmer who inherited his unique savoir-faire from the ancestors of his ancestors has not survived postwar modernization.        

According to a report issued by the Agriculture Ministry in 2010, French farmers, who now represent less than 4 percent of the working population, have become entrepreneurs, working 54 hours a week (more than national average), in farms that have grown bigger, but with fewer workers and little time off.

&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a tough job,&rdquo; Mr. Maignan said. &ldquo;I wake up at 5 a.m. every morning and I&rsquo;m alone most of the time.&rdquo; He said he never leaves his farm for more than 36 hours, because &ldquo;life on a farm changes very fast.&rdquo;        

Michel Lebot, who takes care of 45 dairy cows on 178 acres of land in southwest France, said that most of his colleagues were single. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t socialize, nobody will come to you,&rdquo; he said.        

After his divorce three years ago, Mr. Lebot, 49, was left alone with five children. He recently joined &ldquo;atraverschamps.com&rdquo; to find a &ldquo;soul mate&rdquo; before turning 50. Though he hasn&rsquo;t found anyone yet, online dating has opened new possibilities. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready to turn my farm into a guesthouse, work less, travel more, and enjoy life with a woman,&rdquo; he said.        

Bruno Montourcy, a farmer from Aveyron, a district in southern France known for Roquefort cheese, founded agri-dating.fr, a site also intended to promote rural life and publicize the difficulties of farmers, especially their social isolation.        

In September, in his village of Laissac, Mr. Montourcy will bring hundreds of farmers of both sexes together with people from all over the country for a day of rural fun &mdash; with hiking, canoeing, paintball and cooking classes, among other activities.        

Farmers will also have the opportunity to meet people through a traditional meal and party, and will be offered, according to the program, the chance to drive a tractor &ldquo;in the company of another charming farmer.&rdquo;        

&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a project to revive the attractiveness of the countryside,&rdquo; Mr. Montourcy said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s our demographic future at stake.&rdquo;        

Dating sites like atraverschamps.com are increasingly popular with female urbanites attracted to country life. For Mr. Gagnon of atraverschamps.com, women see an authenticity in rural life and often praise farmers for their genuineness.        

&ldquo;There is an idealized vision of pastoral life, great spaces, and a desire to go back to the roots,&rdquo; Mr. Gagnon said. &ldquo;Many women fantasize about a healthy life in the countryside.&rdquo;        

Ms. Chollet, Mr. Maignan&rsquo;s fianc&eacute;e, said she joined atraverschamps.com to meet &ldquo;real people.&rdquo; In cities, she said, &ldquo;everyone is obsessed with image and big cars.&rdquo;        

Ms. Chollet, who spent most of her childhood vacations in the countryside, said she was &ldquo;moved&rdquo; by Mr. Maignan&rsquo;s &ldquo;sincerity&rdquo; and felt nostalgia for the rural life. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t just fallen in love with Patrick,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I fell in love with the area, the countryside, and each time I come, it feels like home.&rdquo;
