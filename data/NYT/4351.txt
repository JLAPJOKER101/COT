Turkey&rsquo;s prime minister said Wednesday that his efforts to stop a Syrian crackdown on a five-month-old uprising were being ignored, much as similar demands were disregarded by Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi of Libya. &ldquo;We made our calls&rdquo; to Colonel Qaddafi, &ldquo;but unfortunately we got no result,&rdquo; Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, above, said Wednesday. &ldquo;The same thing is happening with Syria at the moment.&rdquo; President Bashar al-Assad of Syria has unleashed tanks, troops and snipers in an attempt to retake control in rebellious areas.
