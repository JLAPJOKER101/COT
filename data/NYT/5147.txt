Sri Lanka released about 1,800 former Tamil Tiger rebels on Friday who had been held since the nation&rsquo;s civil war ended more than two years ago. They were among about 11,000 rebels who surrendered at the end of the war in May 2009. Rights groups and other countries have urged the government to either charge the detainees or release them. The military says about 1,000 still remain in military-run rehabilitation centers.
