Guys Im still really sleepy from China jetlag so I dont know if Ill get through the entire hour of this, but I know itll interest some of you and probably me when I wake up so Im posting it here so some other tech blogger doesnt get to it first.Mobile developer and Harvard CS student Connor Swick has hooked us up with this recording of Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook VP of Engineering Mike Schroepfer and engineering director Jocelyn Goldfeins visit to Harvard today  the purpose of which was to convince Harvard CS grads to pick the storied social network when choosing future employers. Im about ten minutes in and its pretty fascinating from a historical standpoint (moderator David Malan is now reading an email from Zuck to one of his old CS profs describing one of his proto-projects, Six Degrees of Harry Louis).You can listen to the entire panel punctuated by the incessant nervous laughter of the classroom below.And heres the letter the Harvard Office of Career Services, pitching the panel to select students.Dear SEAS students,The Office of Career Services is pleased to announce a unique opportunity to learn what it is like to work at Facebook from a number of senior representatives, including Harvard alumnus Mark Zuckerberg, Founder and CEO at Facebook.Hear about cutting edge technology at Facebook, opportunities to join the Facebook team, and the unique employment culture of this social-networking site with over 800 million users.
