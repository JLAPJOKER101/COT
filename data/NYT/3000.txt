President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad withdrew as the caretaker chief of Iran&rsquo;s oil ministry and appointed an ally to the job, state television reported Thursday. A day after Parliament voted to take Mr. Ahmadinejad to court for taking over the ministry, the president handed the job to Mohammad Aliabadi, who has served as head of Iran&rsquo;s Olympic committee. The skirmish over the ministry was the third public dispute in the last three months between Mr. Ahmadinejad and the hard-line establishment.
