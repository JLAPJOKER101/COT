The advisory Shura Council said Monday that women should be allowed to vote and run as candidates in future municipal elections. Saudi authorities announced in March that half the seats in municipal councils would be elected in the future, but they ruled out female candidates or voters. The council said the government &ldquo;should take the necessary measures to include female voters in municipal elections, in accordance with Islamic Sharia.&rdquo; A council spokesman said the recommendation &ldquo;has nothing to do with the current elections but is rather a recommendation for future elections.&rdquo;
