The army said Thursday that it had captured the man responsible for an arson attack on a Monterrey casino that killed 52 people. The suspect, Carlos Oliva Castillo, known as &ldquo;The Frog,&rdquo; a leader of the Zeta drug organization, was arrested in Saltillo on Wednesday after hours of shootouts between soldiers and gang members. The authorities have arrested 11 others, including a state police officer, in connection with the August casino attack, one of the worst attacks by organized crime on unarmed civilians in Mexico&rsquo;s history.
