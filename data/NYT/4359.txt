In the days since a Tibetan Buddhist monk in southwestern Sichuan Province set himself on fire to protest Chinese policies, the authorities have sent as many as 1,000 armed police officers to surround the monk&rsquo;s monastery and have restricted telephone and Internet access, according to advocacy groups. The monk, Tsewang Norbu, was the second this year to kill himself by self-immolation. The suicide of the other monk, Phuntsog, at the Kirti Monastery, in a nearby prefecture in Sichuan, set off a violent standoff between local residents and paramilitary police, who eventually detained 300 monks. Before his suicide on Monday morning, Tsewang Norbu reportedly handed out leaflets demanding the return of the Dalai Lama, the exiled spiritual leader, and calling for an end of the repression that has intensified in the area since the clashes at Kirti Monastery.
