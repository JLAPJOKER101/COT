Ebook creators are notoriously tight-fisted with their sales stats but today William Lynch, CEO of B&N, announced the company has sold millions of devices and said the Nook Color was one of the top selling low-priced tablets, placing the company high in the pantheon of slate device manufacturers.The Nook Color has always been seen as a stalking horse when it came to tablet sales. Although woefully underpowered for the average Ice Cream Sandwich lover, the device, even jailbroken, offers an introductory experience and is seen as sort of a gateway drug to more powerful Android and iOS devices.The Nook Color has dropped $200 at Best Buy and the Nook Tablet is, well, a tablet. Its clearly aimed at the tablet market and, more important, it acts as B&Ns entree into a currently hot market. By avoiding reader branding entirely, the device seems to hit on a number consumer touch points.While we cant expect B&N and Amazon to ever back down in the numbers arms war, the fact that they are announcing even nebulous numbers is a testament to the growing popularity of their devices.
