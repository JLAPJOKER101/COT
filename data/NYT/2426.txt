Stunned relatives held a vigil on Wednesday outside a mine in northern Mexico where the fate of nine workers remained unknown after an explosion that killed at least five of their colleagues. Rescuers used picks, shovels and their hands to tunnel through dirt, wood, metal and rock in a frantic effort to reach the miners after an explosion on Tuesday at the mine in Coahuila State. The federal attorney general&rsquo;s office, which promised to open an investigation, said the explosion in the primitive, vertical-shaft mine was caused by a gas buildup.        

The explosion was so powerful that it seriously injured a 15-year-old boy working on a conveyor belt outside the pit. Labor Secretary Javier Lozano said it was very unlikely that any miners inside could have withstood the force of the blast.
