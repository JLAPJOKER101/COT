Egypt closed the largest of the Great Pyramids in Giza on Friday over concerns that groups would try to hold spiritual ceremonies on the site at 11:11 a.m. on Nov. 11, 2011. Mustafa Amin, the director of the national antiquities authority, said that the Khufu pyramid would be closed to visitors until Saturday morning for &ldquo;necessary maintenance.&rdquo; The closing followed unconfirmed reports in the local news media that groups would try to hold ceremonies on the site to take advantage of mysterious powers coming from the pyramid on the rare date. Speaking by phone from the pyramids after 11:11 had passed, the director of the complex, Ali al-Asfar, said he had seen nothing out of the ordinary.
