A court in Azerbaijan on Wednesday sentenced the political activist Bakhtiyar Hajiyev, who used Facebook to help organize antigovernment demonstrations, to two years in prison on draft evasion charges. Mr. Hajiyev, 29, who studied public policy at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, ran for Parliament last year as an opposition candidate. He was arrested after his name was listed on a Facebook page calling on young people to join protests on March 11. Mr. Hajiyev&rsquo;s arrest follows the sentencing of Jabbar Savalan, 20, to two and a half years on drug possession charges. Mr. Savalan was arrested in February after he announced a protest on his Facebook page, according to Amnesty International. A week ago, the European Parliament passed a resolution condemning Azeri officials for human rights violations, including the violent dispersal of peaceful protests. Azeri officials warned that it could damage relations between Azerbaijan and European governments.
