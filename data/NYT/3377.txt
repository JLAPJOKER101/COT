CARACAS, Venezuela &mdash; The prolonged seclusion of President Hugo Ch&aacute;vez in Cuba after undergoing emergency surgery has stirred opponents here who were already chafing at Venezuela&rsquo;s reliance on Cuban advisers for military and intelligence affairs.        

The paucity of details about Mr. Ch&aacute;vez&rsquo;s illness and recovery over the last two weeks &mdash; news has been haltingly released by state media here with cautiousness befitting Cuba&rsquo;s Communist propaganda apparatus &mdash; has also emboldened the fractious Venezuelan opposition, which aspires to defeat Mr. Ch&aacute;vez in a presidential election next year.        

His opponents have seized on questions over whether the Constitution allows him to oversee national affairs for an undetermined stretch of time from outside the country. The criticism is building as his government grapples with problems like recurring electricity shortages and a simmering prison crisis highlighted by a standoff between armed inmates and soldiers, which has left more than 20 dead.        

&ldquo;This is an unacceptable humiliation for Venezuelans to have the president governing from Havana,&rdquo; Mar&iacute;a Corina Machado, a legislator and a prominent critic of Mr. Ch&aacute;vez&rsquo;s, said in an interview. &ldquo;The president of the republic needs to show his face.&rdquo;        

Mr. Ch&aacute;vez, 56, has spoken publicly just once since surgery in Cuba on June 10 for what he and senior Venezuelan officials called a pelvic abscess.        

&ldquo;I got sick in a good place,&rdquo; Mr. Ch&aacute;vez said in a 23-minute telephone interview on June 12 with Telesur, a Venezuela-backed news network. Praising Cuba&rsquo;s health care system, he said that biopsies had not detected any signs of a &ldquo;malignant&rdquo; illness.        

Questions remain over what caused his ailment in the first place. A pelvic abscess is a collection of pus deep inside the abdomen, which can be caused by an infection in places throughout the body. The ailment&rsquo;s onset can generate considerable discomfort, including fever, chills and abdominal pain.        

&ldquo;Roughly speaking, the pain could be compared to a burst appendix, only more gradual,&rdquo; said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University.        

Mr. Ch&aacute;vez, in the Telesur interview, said he felt unwell during a private meeting in Havana with Fidel Castro, the Cuban revolutionary leader. Mr. Ch&aacute;vez said he felt pain in his pelvic area, and that Mr. Castro convened top Cuban doctors to evaluate him.        

The recovery seems slow. Ad&aacute;n Ch&aacute;vez, the president&rsquo;s brother, said Wednesday that the Venezuelan leader was expected to remain in Cuba 10 to 12 more days.        

The episode has led to a candid discussion in blogs and privately owned media here about Mr. Ch&aacute;vez&rsquo;s health. A teetotaler who smoked cigarettes well into his 12-year presidency, Mr. Ch&aacute;vez had good health for years and endured punishing foreign travel schedules.        

But he has been noticeably quieter this year. Four health problems have contributed to this public pause, according to a report by &Uacute;ltimas Not&iacute;cias, a daily newspaper that often publishes favorable coverage of Mr. Ch&aacute;vez and his government.        

In February, a bout with the flu led him to suspend his Sunday television program, and two months later a bad cold caused another suspension. In May, Mr. Ch&aacute;vez said that a knee problem related to his stint as an army paratrooper three decades ago was requiring the attention of doctors, and he used crutches while addressing a crowd from the balcony of the presidential palace.        

State media have avoided a focus on details about the president&rsquo;s health. A day after his surgery was disclosed, state television abruptly halted a live broadcast of a news conference with a cabinet minister when a reporter asked about Mr. Ch&aacute;vez&rsquo;s health.        

Cilia Flores, a pro-Ch&aacute;vez legislator, in an article carried by the state news agency, called opposition figures &ldquo;vampires and vultures&rdquo; for asking whether the president had the authority to continue governing from abroad.        

Cuba is Venezuela&rsquo;s closest ally, and the extension of Cuba&rsquo;s influence into even the president&rsquo;s medical care has touched a nerve here. Venezuelan doctors have questioned why the president opted for care in Cuba.        

&ldquo;Our professional and technical capacity is top level,&rdquo; said Jos&eacute; F&eacute;lix Oletta, a former health minister. &ldquo;A pelvic abscess is a problem that could be resolved with the level of our technology and instruments, and the knowledge of our professionals.&rdquo;        

Legal experts have been discussing whether it is lawful for Mr. Ch&aacute;vez to continue governing from Cuba. &ldquo;The fact that the president is in Havana promulgating laws and making presidential decisions, while not transferring authority to the vice president, is clearly a violation of the Constitution,&rdquo; said Gustavo Tarre Brice&ntilde;o, a professor of constitutional law at the Central University of Venezuela.        

Still, Mr. Tarre Brice&ntilde;o and other legal experts said the possibility was remote that the judicial branch might pressure Mr. Ch&aacute;vez. Venezuela&rsquo;s highest courts are controlled by judges who are supporters of Mr. Ch&aacute;vez.        

Mr. Ch&aacute;vez has made it clear that he saw no problem with staying in Cuba and said he remained the best judge of his capacity to lead Venezuela. &ldquo;If I perceive myself with diminished faculties to manage the government, I&rsquo;ll be the first to make a decision,&rdquo; he said in the June 12 interview.
