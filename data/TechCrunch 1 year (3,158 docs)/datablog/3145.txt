Seagate has just announced that theyve sold their 1 millionth Momentus XT hybrid solid-state/mechanical hard drive, an interesting development for the hard drive manufacturer especially considering the rise of expensive SSD drives. These hybrid drives run at 7,200 RPM, nearly twice as fast as standard mechanical drives. The drives contain some solid-state memory as well as a full mechanical drive and offer speed improvements at a very low initial cost. The Hybrid drive is an interesting technological advancement. Its cheaper than a full SSD drive but thanks to a 4GB cache you can read and write to the drive  at least in theory  nearly as fast as you can with a SSD drive.To be clear, this isnt a full SD drive. The speed savings are eventually reduced by the dependence on mechanical parts, but the price  about $99 for a 500GB model  is pretty good for a 7,200rpm drive.
