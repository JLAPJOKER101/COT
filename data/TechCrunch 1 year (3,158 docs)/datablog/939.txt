Wolfram Alpha, the computational knowledge engine, just launched a desktop app for Windows 7 PCs through Intels AppUp store. After launching numerous iOS and Android apps (including for the B&N Nook and Amazons Kindle Fire), this is the first time Wolfram Alpha is introducing a dedicated desktop app for its service. The application costs $2.99 and is only available through Intels store.There are a few oddities here. First of all, its not clear why you would really need a dedicated desktop app for Wolfram Alpha. The app, after all, doesnt really offer anything that the free web-based service doesnt also offer. According to the product page, the main selling point here seems to be that you dont need a browser to use it. For most people, using a browser isnt much of a hassle these days. The only semi-compelling reasons to use the desktop app are that it comes with a specialized keyboard (thats a software keyboard, of course, not a hardware one) and extended copy and paste support.The other oddity is that Wolfram Alpha is exclusively selling this app trough Intels AppUp store, the companys app store for PCs and MeeGo-based devices. We werent able to track down any user numbers for AppUp, but the fact that even the most popular free app in the store only has one review makes us think that it isnt a huge hit by any means.According to todays announcement, Wolfram Alpha plans to bring all of its mobile apps to AppUp, starting with its Course Assistant apps. Theres no mention of other stores or platforms, so its not clear if the company has any plans to bring its own desktop apps to Apples Mac app store anytime soon.
