Hurricane Jova roared toward Mexico&rsquo;s vulnerable Pacific Coast on Tuesday, leading to evacuations in the tourist area and shutting down the port in Manzanillo, one of the biggest in the country. The storm had maximum sustained winds of 100 miles per hour, the United States National Hurricane Center reported, and it was expected to make landfall between Barra de Navidad and Puerto Vallarta.
