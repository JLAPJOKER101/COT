The criminal trial of former President Jacques Chirac began Monday, but it was quickly suspended. Mr. Chirac, 78, the first head of state to be tried since the Vichy leader Philippe P&eacute;tain was convicted of treason in 1945, is accused of padding the Paris payroll with ghost workers who were political cronies while he was mayor from 1977 to 1995.        

On Monday, his lawyers challenged a previous decision to dismiss a statute of limitations on the charges, arguing that it violated the Constitution. The judge, Dominique Pauthe, suspended the hearing, saying he would rule Tuesday on whether the issue should be evaluated by the Court of Cassation, which could delay the trial for months.
