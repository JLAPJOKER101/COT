Bayreuth University said Friday that the former German defense minister, Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg, &ldquo;deliberately&rdquo; plagiarized parts of his doctoral thesis. The university said a commission reviewing the thesis established that he had &ldquo;clearly and grossly violated standard research practices and in so doing deliberately deceived.&rdquo; Mr. Guttenberg resigned over the accusation in March, but said he had mistakenly lost track of the sources of the passages in question.
