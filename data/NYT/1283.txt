Six top politicians from Kenya have been summoned to appear at the International Criminal Court in April to answer charges of crimes against humanity in connection with Kenya&rsquo;s election violence in 2007 and 2008. The men, whose names were first cited by the prosecutor in December, include Uhuru Kenyatta, finance minister and son of Kenya&rsquo;s founding leader; Mohammed Hussein Ali, the former police chief; and several other ministers. Coinciding with the court&rsquo;s announcement, Kenyan government envoys have arrived at the United Nations in New York, seeking to block the move.
