The Supreme Court declared Friday that President Paul Biya had won re-election by a landslide, allowing him to extend his 29-year rule for another 7-year term. In an eight-hour reading of the results, the court said Mr. Biya, 78, took over 77.9 percent of the votes against a field of more than 20 opponents. Seven opponents had asked the court to annul the vote because of fraud allegations. The court dismissed their appeal on Thursday.
