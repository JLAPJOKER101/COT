An army major and 14 paramilitary soldiers were killed Monday when they were ambushed by Baluch nationalist militants in Baluchistan Province, a military spokesman said. The attack, the worst suffered by the Pakistani military in the province in several years, occurred in Kohlu district, a stronghold of the Marri tribe, which has been at the forefront of the Baluch armed resistance movement.
