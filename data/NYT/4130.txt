Brazil&rsquo;s defense minister has resigned after a newspaper reported that he had criticized two Cabinet colleagues. The defense minister, Nelson Jobim, is the third Cabinet member to quit since President Dilma Rousseff took office Jan. 1. The government said that Mr. Jobim, who denied that he had criticized other ministers, would be replaced by Celso Amorim, a former foreign minister.
