A truck driver sentenced to life in prison for evading $550,000 in road tolls will be offered another trial, a court ruled Friday. The Pingdingshan Intermediate Court in Henan Province said it would retry the man, Shi Jianfeng, citing what it described as new evidence of an accomplice who helped him defraud toll collectors over an eight-month period. In a posting on its Web site on Friday, the court said intense media attention to the case persuaded it to question the defendant again, revealing that he had not acted alone. Mr. Shi, a farmer who had turned to hauling construction material, evaded the tolls on his two trucks during more than 2,300 trips.
