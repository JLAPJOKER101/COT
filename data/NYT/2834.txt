Nearly 2,000 Mongolian students on Wednesday marched on a government building in the city of Xilinhot in Inner Mongolia Province to demand that Chinese officials respect the rights of Mongolian herders, according to the Southern Mongolia Human Rights Information Center. The center, an advocacy group based in New York, posted on its Web site photographs of the protesters, the vast majority of whom were dressed in yellow or blue athletic jackets. The protest was over the way Chinese officials handled the death on May 10 of a Mongolian herder named Mergen, who was run over during a dispute by a coal truck driven by an ethnic Han, according to Mongolians in the area. The Han are the dominant ethnicity in China and make up the majority of the population in Inner Mongolia. The protest on Tuesday ended after government officials made several promises, including addressing the case of Mergen. Though many Mongolians resent the Han, the Mongolians in Inner Mongolia have rarely held large protests.
