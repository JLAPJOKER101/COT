PARIS &mdash; The investigation into what caused the crash of an Air France jet two years ago suffered a major setback, officials said Wednesday, when search crews in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean located one of the plane&rsquo;s black boxes &mdash; only to discover that its memory unit was missing.        

Martine Del Bono, a spokesman for France&rsquo;s Bureau of Accident Investigations, said the memory module of the plane&rsquo;s flight data recorder &mdash; which contains information on the plane&rsquo;s position, speed, altitude and heading when it ran into trouble &mdash; had been &ldquo;dissociated&rdquo; from its protective housing. &ldquo;This is no doubt due to the shock of impact with the water,&rdquo; she said.        

French investigators said the recorder was located by underwater drones late Tuesday, surrounded by debris from other parts of the airplane. The search continued Wednesday for the missing component, as well as for a second black box, which contains recordings of the conversations in the cockpit in the minutes before the crash.        

But Ms. Del Bono conceded that the failure to find the data recorder&rsquo;s memory unit was a disappointment. &ldquo;We would have hoped that it had remained intact,&rdquo; she said.        

All 228 passengers and crew members were killed when Flight 447 went down on June 1, 2009.        

It crashed in a thunderstorm en route to Paris from Rio de Janeiro.        

Flight recorders are designed to resist the effects of impact, corrosion and pressure. Investigators declined to say Wednesday whether, without its protective housing, the data module &mdash; if found &mdash; would be sufficiently readable to advance the investigation.
