Silicon Valley, President Obama just cant quit you. In the Bay Area and free this weekend? Got 35K to toss around? Well if youve ever wanted to meet an in-office President nows your chance to attend an Obama fundraiser dinner, going down at Facebook COO Sheryl Sandbergs house in Atherton on Sunday the 25th.This Obama Victory Fund 2012 dinner at the 5th most powerful woman in the worlds house comes after the President made appearances at Google exec Marissa Mayers Palo Alto house last fall (at a comparable $30K a pop) and attended an exclusive meetup in February at Kleiner Perkins VC John Doerrs house  Where the guest list included Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Apple CEO Steve Jobs, Yahoo CEO Carol Bartz, Cisco’s CEO John Chambers, Twitter CEO Dick Costolo, Oracle CEO Larry Ellison, Netflix CEO Reed Hastings, Genentech Chairman Art Levinson, Google CEO Eric Schmidt and VC Steve Westly Doerr. Obama also hung out at Salesforce CEO Marc Benioffs house in April.So why so much SV love? Obama has positioned himself as technology-sector friendly throughout his campaign efforts and candidacy, recently being interviewed by Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg at Facebook HQ, hosting a Twitter town-hall and hiring Threadless former CTO as his campaign CTO.On a budget but still want to rub elbows with the President?  Former Symantec CEO John W. Thompson and his wife Sandra will be hosting an earlier and cheaper reception at $2,500 general admission and $7,500 for a photo (Obama will cut you a deal at $10K if youre two people).Via: SFGate
