President Sheik Sharif Sheik Ahmed, left, said Friday that a government offensive was gaining ground after a week of fighting against militants who for years have confined his administration to a few blocks of the capital. &ldquo;The fighting is going on and our troops are winning,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Our operation will continue until we secure the country.&rdquo; Government and African Union forces clashed with militants in Mogadishu on Friday and captured the Defense Ministry building, which had been serving as the militants&rsquo; base. The insurgents denied the government&rsquo;s claim. &ldquo;We have foiled the so-called offensive declared by the Christians,&rdquo; said a spokesman for the Shabab rebels, referring to non-Muslim African Union peacekeepers from Uganda and Burundi.
