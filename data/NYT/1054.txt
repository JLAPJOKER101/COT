The death toll from the earthquake in Christchurch on Tuesday has risen to 144, the police said Saturday. About 226 people remain missing, officials said. Water and power supplies to thousands have been cut, and many people have been forced to sleep in their cars or tents as their houses sway with the relentless aftershocks.
