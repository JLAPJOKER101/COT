Technical problems will keep a Turkish humanitarian aid ship that was the target of a fatal raid by the Israeli military last year from joining a flotilla that is set to leave for Gaza next week, the pro-Palestinian charity that owns the boat announced on Friday. The charity, the Humanitarian Relief Foundation, said the decision was not the result of political pressure from the government. Nine people were killed in the raid on the ship, the Mavi Marmara, straining ties between Turkey and Israel. The new flotilla is expected to challenge Israel&rsquo;s blockade of the Gaza Strip this month. Israeli military officials warned Thursday that they would use force if necessary to prevent boats from breaking the blockade.
