Emilio Palacio, a senior journalist at the newspaper El Universo, has disclosed that he has fled to the United States after he and three of the newspaper&rsquo;s board members were sentenced to three years in prison in a dispute over coverage of President Rafael Correa. A judge also ordered the four men to pay Mr. Correa $30 million in damages and imposed a $10 million fine on El Universo over a column questioning Mr. Correa&rsquo;s handling of a police uprising last year. Mr. Palacio, El Universo&rsquo;s op-ed editor, and the board members were appealing the ruling. &ldquo;One would have to be blind not to understand that they want me behind bars,&rdquo; Mr. Palacio, who is in Miami, wrote in a public letter.
