The United States said Friday that it was disappointed that Thailand had charged an American citizen with insulting the country&rsquo;s monarchy, a severe offense that carries a penalty of as much as 15 years in prison. The American, Joe Gordon, is accused of translating parts of an unauthorized biography of King Bhumibol Adulyadej and posting articles online that were deemed to have defamed the royal family. Mr. Gordon, 54, was formally charged on Thursday after being arrested in May and detained for the maximum 84 days that a suspect can be held without charge. He has denied the charges.
