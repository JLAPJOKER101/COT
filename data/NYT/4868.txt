The Iraqi president has been negotiating with Iranian officials in an attempt to gain the release of two American hikers held in Iran on espionage and trespassing convictions, according to Kurdish officials in Iraq. The president, Jalal Talabani, has been told by Iranian officials that the hikers will probably be released, the officials said. Iran&rsquo;s president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, had said that the hikers, Shane M. Bauer and Joshua F. Fattal, would be freed by Thursday, but Iran&rsquo;s judiciary ruled otherwise. The conflicting messages are believed to reflect a power struggle between Mr. Ahmadinejad and Iran&rsquo;s conservative establishment. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said Thursday the United States had &ldquo;received word through a number of sources&rdquo; that the men would be released, despite the apparent confusion in Iran.
