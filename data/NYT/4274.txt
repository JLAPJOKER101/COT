JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) &mdash; The Youth League of the governing party in South Africa apologized Saturday to the bloc&rsquo;s leadership for comments in which it called for the ouster of Botswana&rsquo;s democratically elected government.        

The governing party, the African National Congress, publicly criticized the Youth League and its leader, Julius Malema, this month for the remarks. A party spokesman, Jackson Mthembu, told eNews Channel that its leaders would discuss the matter but would not say whether Mr. Malema would be disciplined.        

The Youth League said in a statement that it &ldquo;has never, and will never, define itself outside the policy confines and directives of the A.N.C., and will whenever expected be available to listen to political and organizational guidance from the leadership.&rdquo;        

Mr. Malema has already been a thorn in the side for the party over his racially divisive comments and repeated calls for the nationalization of mines in South Africa, a major supplier of platinum, gold and diamonds. But he also holds a significant populist appeal for much of South Africa&rsquo;s black population, and senior party leadership has often turned to courting him publicly.
