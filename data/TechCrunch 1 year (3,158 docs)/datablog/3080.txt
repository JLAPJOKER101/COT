WebEx has managed to maintain a pretty good lock on the enterprise world with their online video conferencing/meeting service, but theres one place theyve always fallen a bit short: small businesses.The problem? Its just too dang expensive. Even on the cheapest plan (which supports 1 host with 25 people per meeting), its a solid 50 bucks per month. When youre on a bootstrap budget and every penny counts (and more importantly, when reasonable alternatives can be hacked together on the cheap), 50 bucks might as well be $5000.Looking to make their first stab into the small business world, WebEx will later today launch WebEx 8, a cheaper monthly service focused directly on companies with smaller teams.WebEx 8 offers the same functionality as the other plans that WebEx already offers, with one exception: instead of 25 people per meeting, youre limited to 8.Beyond that, its all pretty much a feature-by-feature match.

With things like Google+ Hangout feature and Join.me respectively making huge group video chat and desktop sharing accessible to anyone with half a brain, some of WebExs key selling points are starting to seem a bit less sound. Theyve still got a few differentiating features (like their rather solid iPhone/iPad apps) to fight back with, but that price had to come down eventually.The $19 plan should go live later this morning.
