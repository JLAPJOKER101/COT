A hard-line Israeli group said Tuesday that it was beginning plans for a new tourist center at the site of a politically contentious archaeological dig in a largely Arab neighborhood outside Jerusalem&rsquo;s Old City, drawing criticism from Palestinian officials. The project&rsquo;s sponsor, the Elad Foundation, said the new visitors&rsquo; center and parking garage would be built above a section of the excavation area known as the City of David, leaving the ruins below accessible. The site is just outside the Old City walls at the edge of the neighborhood of Silwan in East Jerusalem, the part of the city the Palestinian Authority says it wants as the capital of a hoped-for state.
