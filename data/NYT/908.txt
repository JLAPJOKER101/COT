PARIS &mdash; The latest play to grip France might be called &ldquo;En Attendant D.S.K.&rdquo; Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, is absent, like Godot in Samuel Beckett&rsquo;s famous play, &ldquo;En Attendant Godot,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Waiting for Godot,&rdquo; making it easier to argue about him.        

For some, Mr. Strauss-Kahn is a credible alternative to President Nicolas Sarkozy, an intelligent economist with a global reputation. For others, he is a cosmopolitan figure out of touch with the real France, &ldquo;la France profonde,&rdquo; and more at ease in the salons of Paris and Washington &mdash; a time-honored canard in French politics, with more than a whiff, some here said, of anti-Semitism.        

The leading Socialist candidate for the 2012 French presidential election, at least in the opinion polls, Mr. Strauss-Kahn, 61, has steadfastly refused to talk about politics in any form, let alone the question of whether he will quit the fund job and leave Washington to run for the presidency. With the Socialist Party planning primaries to pick its candidate, Mr. Strauss-Kahn will have to decide fairly soon.        

But the guns are out for him, especially since his wife, Anne Sinclair, a French journalist, said in an interview with the weekly Le Point that she would prefer that he not seek a second term as head of the monetary fund.        

That threw the rivalrous Socialists into a tizzy, with the party&rsquo;s leader, Martine Aubry, refusing to comment. But it threw the allies of President Sarkozy and his center-right party, the Union for a Popular Movement, into combat mode, since all the early polls show Mr. Sarkozy losing the presidency to Mr. Strauss-Kahn.        

Even relatively apolitical figures in the Sarkozy government, like Finance Minister Christine Lagarde, have praised Mr. Strauss-Kahn for his performance in Washington, describing how crucial the fund is to the management of the crippled world economy and the shaky euro, and how vital it is that he remain in his post.        

Brice Hortefeux, the interior minister and a close friend of Mr. Sarkozy, said Mr. Strauss-Kahn&rsquo;s years in Washington had put him out of touch with France. &ldquo;Dominique Strauss-Kahn, who is currently far from France, is not necessarily the best placed to know the problems of the French people at first hand,&rdquo; Mr. Hortefeux said recently.        

For &Eacute;rik Emptaz, editor in chief of the satirical weekly Le Canard Encha&icirc;n&eacute;, the whole business &ldquo;really is fairly surreal.&rdquo; It is not clear Mr. Strauss-Kahn wants to come back and run a France in economic difficulty, Mr. Emptaz said. &ldquo;This is all a lot of hot air. They&rsquo;re doing polls without even knowing who the candidates are going to be.&rdquo;        

Adding to the absurdity, he said, given the international nature of the fund job, &ldquo;the candidate at the center of the debate cannot, theoretically, say anything.&rdquo;        

Mr. Strauss-Kahn, an economist and former cabinet minister, ran last time, losing the Socialist nomination for the presidency in 2006 to S&eacute;gol&egrave;ne Royal, who lost to Mr. Sarkozy. Mr. Strauss-Kahn was then offered the monetary fund job by Mr. Sarkozy, in part to get him out of France, and was quoted by American diplomats in a May 2006 cable released by WikiLeaks as describing &ldquo;the collective hallucination&rdquo; around Ms. Royal, whom he described as &ldquo;fragile.&rdquo;        

He has been called a member of &ldquo;the caviar left,&rdquo; out of touch with his own more left-leaning party. Some wonder if he might lose in party primaries despite his high poll numbers, which they say are based partly on name recognition and unhappiness with the current choices.        

But there have been other, uglier notes in the right&rsquo;s reaction, circling around the fact that Mr. Strauss-Kahn is Jewish. Christian Jacob, a legislator and farmer, described him as an urban intellectual &mdash; a &ldquo;bobo,&rdquo; short for &ldquo;bourgeois-bohemian.&rdquo; Mr. Jacob said that Mr. Strauss-Kahn did not represent &ldquo;the image of France, the image of rural France, the image of the France of terroirs and territories.&rdquo; This notion of rootless cosmopolitanism, of being out of touch with the soil and the mystery of &ldquo;la France profonde,&rdquo; is an old trope for foreign and Jewish influence.        

Even the president of France&rsquo;s main Jewish organization, the Representative Council of Jewish Institutions of France, called Mr. Jacob&rsquo;s comments &ldquo;a very great clumsiness.&rdquo; The group&rsquo;s leader, Richard Prasquier, said that as a farmer, Mr. Jacob may have &ldquo;a particular feeling for the soil,&rdquo; but that it was not &ldquo;an essential criterion for leading the nation.&rdquo; He added that he hoped &ldquo;the political debate will become more elevated.&rdquo;        

Pierre Moscovici, an ally of Mr. Strauss-Kahn, was blunter. &ldquo;The attack resembles a little the rhetoric of the far right between the two world wars,&rdquo; Mr. Moscovici said. &ldquo;There is something unhealthy here,&rdquo; he said, and while Mr. Jacob &ldquo;is not a bad guy, I ask him to pull back his statement and change his song.&rdquo;        

On Wednesday, Mr. Jacob denied any anti-Semitic feeling, saying that &ldquo;as a farmer, I can&rsquo;t recognize myself or identify with him.&rdquo;        

&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t incarnate the rural world, that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;I reacted with my peasant core, as a farmer.&rdquo;        

Of course Mr. Sarkozy is also seen as an urban figure, a lawyer with no roots in rural France, and, although Roman Catholic, of Jewish ancestry on his mother&rsquo;s side.        

The right&rsquo;s reaction was perceived as a shot across the bow of Mr. Strauss-Kahn, who has also had a reputation for womanizing, and had to admit to an affair with an economist at the fund, who later left. He was cleared of harassment or abuse of power, but was criticized by the board in 2008 for &ldquo;a serious error of judgment.&rdquo;        

Mr. Emptaz said that Mr. Sarkozy, who has had his own troubles with Champagne tastes and women, might like Mr. Strauss-Kahn as an opponent because Mr. Sarkozy &ldquo;knows he has the same failings.&rdquo;        

Le Canard Encha&icirc;n&eacute; thinks, like many diplomats here, that Mr. Strauss-Kahn will not run. &ldquo;Anne is bored in Washington, Dominique much less,&rdquo; the paper said Wednesday. It suggested he would prefer to head a larger, reformed monetary fund and later succeed Herman Van Rompuy as president of the European Council.        

To add to the drama, Mr. Strauss-Kahn is visiting France this week and goes on television Sunday night. Having said last November that he wants to complete his term, which ends in 2012, he may say little about the future.        

&ldquo;It&rsquo;s in his interest to have people believe, up to the last minute, that he&rsquo;s coming back,&rdquo; Mr. Emptaz said. &ldquo;What he&rsquo;d like is to arrive as the Messiah.&rdquo;
