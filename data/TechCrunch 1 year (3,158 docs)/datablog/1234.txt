Really? I mean, really?Yesterday, 1,900 T-Mobile employees got some very bad news  they would all soon be out of jobs, as the company announced their intention to shut down seven call centers. That in and of itself is a shame, but AT&Ts reaction to the announcement is even more shameful. You see, AT&Ts Jim Cicconi (their Senior Executive Vice President of External and Legislative Affairs, no less) took to the companys public policy blog to say that AT&T promised to preserve these very same call centers and jobs if our merger was approved. Dont you see? AT&T couldve saved those jobs, if only the merger was approved! This didnt need to happen!Please.We also predicted that if the merger failed, T-Mobile would be forced into major layoffs, he went on to say. â€œAt that time, the current FCC not only rejected our pledges and predictions, they also questioned our credibility.Ive read the thing a few times, and I sort of get where Mr. Cicconi is coming from  the FCC called them out specifically on their stance on the merger creating jobs, and AT&T was (sadly) correct in this case. But really, Mr. Cicconi, 1,900 people just found out they would be out of a job in three months. Did you really, honestly think that this was the best opportunity to give the FCC an I told you so? It apparently almost didnt happen, as Mr. Cicconi notes that the company wouldnt comment on a matter like this. Methinks you shouldve gone with the standard protocol on this one, Jim.AT&T doesnt always occupy the most favorable spot in consumers minds (their performance in the J.D. Power service rankings speak rather nicely to that), and shit like this doesnt help their case at all.[hat tip to The Verge]
