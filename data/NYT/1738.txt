Guangdong Province in southern China is tightening rules on foreigners living and working in the province as part of what it calls a clampdown on &ldquo;illegal immigration,&rdquo; according to the official China Daily. A new regulation that takes effect on May 1 asks people to report &ldquo;malpractice&rdquo; involving foreigners, including overstaying visas, illegal entry and working without permits. Guangdong has been one of the most open provinces to foreigners; many foreign-run factories are in the Pearl River Delta area.
