Officials in Belarus said Thursday they had won a $3 billion loan from a Russian-backed fund to alleviate the economic crisis, but Russia&rsquo;s finance minister, Aleksei L. Kudrin, said no such decision by the Eurasian Economic Community had been made. Belarus has little hope of winning loans from Western governments, so Russia and other former Soviet states are negotiating a bailout. Twice this week, Belarussian officials have announced a deal, apparently eager to tamp down market panic, only to be contradicted by Mr. Kudrin.
