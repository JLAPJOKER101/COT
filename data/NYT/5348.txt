A report issued Wednesday by the European Union enlargement office criticized Turkey&rsquo;s reaction to recent gas drilling conducted by Cyprus in the Mediterranean, suggesting continued troubles with Turkey&rsquo;s longstanding bid to join the bloc. Turkey refuses to recognize the Greek Cypriot government &mdash; itself a member of the bloc &mdash; as the sole representative of the disputed island and calls for the reunification of Turkish Cypriots in the north and Greek Cypriots in the south. Turkey has called the gas exploration by the Greek Cypriots an act of provocation and started its own seismic exploration program in the sea, escorted by the Turkish Navy.        

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Also, the European Union granted Serbia candidate status on Wednesday but refused to set a date to begin formal talks for admission into the bloc until Serbia and neighboring Kosovo improved relations, The Associated Press reported. Serbia had expected to get a date for the start of the negotiations after the arrest this year of Ratko Mladic, a fugitive charged with war crimes, The A.P. said.
