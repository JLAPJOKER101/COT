Premier Silvio Berlusconi had sex with a number of prostitutes, Milan prosecutors said on Monday in documents seeking authorization to search some of his properties. The prosecutors are leading an inquiry aimed at determining if Mr. Berlusconi, 74, paid for sex with a 17-year-old Moroccan girl who attended parties at one of his villas last year. Prostitution is not a crime in Italy, but exploiting or aiding prostitution with minors is. The prosecutors said that Mr. Berlusconi had sex with a &ldquo;significant&rdquo; number of young prostitutes and, as compensation, let them stay in apartments he owned without paying rent. Mr. Berlusconi has denied wrongdoing. The Moroccan girl, now 18, has said she was among a number of young women invited to parties at Mr. Berlusconi&rsquo;s villa near Milan. She said in a TV interview that the premier gave her $9,000 but that they did not have sex.
