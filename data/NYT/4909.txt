DAKAR, Senegal &mdash; A revolution led by rappers says something about a country&rsquo;s politics or its music, or maybe both.        

In Senegal, the political mainstream appears stagnant and the musicians anything but, which explains why laid-back musicians with stage names like Fou Malade (&ldquo;Crazy Sick Guy&rdquo;) and Thiat (&ldquo;Junior&rdquo;) are leading a vigorous demonstration movement against the country&rsquo;s octogenarian president, who does not want to leave office.        

The usual regional trappings of power &mdash; a $27 million monumental statue overlooking the capital, a new presidential plane, tinkering with the country&rsquo;s Constitution &mdash; have not gone down well in a poor but proud West African country used to something better. They have led to a season of revolt, on the North African model, in this coastal country, a former French colony.        

There were riots this summer with tear gas and tire burnings, and several large-scale demonstrations, one of them even forcing President Abdoulaye Wade to back away from constitutional changes that would almost ensure his third term in office.        

At the forefront have been rappers like Fou Malade (real name: Malal Talla) and Thiat (Cheikh Oumar Cyrille Tour&eacute;). They have been firing up the crowds of young men who have surged through the city&rsquo;s streets, leading the demonstrators and &mdash; picked on by Mr. Wade&rsquo;s police officers &mdash; serving as martyrs for the antigovernment cause.        

In July, dozens of fans waited for Thiat outside the main prison in Dakar while the police asked him whether he had publicly disrespected Mr. Wade at a rally.        

&ldquo;An old man of 90 who lies has no role in the country,&rdquo; Thiat was accused of saying, and he did not deny it. (Mr. Wade is believed to be in his mid-80s, though there are conflicting accounts.) Amid an outcry in the news media and on the streets, Thiat was let go.        

It is not that Senegal lacks established politicians, political parties or even newspapers opposing Mr. Wade, often with torrents of incendiary if wide-of-the-mark verbiage, a Senegalese tradition. The rappers, however, have struck a nerve because they cut to the chase. Their language is direct, sometimes crude and quite unambiguous.        

&ldquo;In politics, nothin&rsquo; but hypocrites, robbers of cash. Government, why do you always lie, always?&rdquo; rap Fou Malade and his &ldquo;Bat&rsquo;Haillons Blin-D&rdquo; (&ldquo;Fou Malade and the Armored Battalion,&rdquo; with a play on the word for &ldquo;rags,&rdquo; haillon) in French, in the song &ldquo;We&rsquo;re Going to Tell Everything.&rdquo;        

In Wolof, Senegal&rsquo;s dominant language, they continue, comparing the state to a small, traditional fishing boat: &ldquo;The pirogue is sinking, and whoever dares say it spends the night at the D.I.C.,&rdquo; referring to the Criminal Investigations Division.        

As for Mr. Wade, Fou Malade sings, his &ldquo;speeches get on our nerves.&rdquo;        

The rappers have not had lucrative turns in power themselves, as many in the political opposition have. And as young men in ragged T-shirts and rough wool caps &mdash; carrying the look and style of the thousands of youthful dispossessed who eke out marginal existences here, selling phone-recharge cards on the streets, for instance &mdash; they are easily identified and easily contrasted with the aging president.        

So it was natural that the rappers would help found a new political movement here, Y&rsquo;En A Marre (&ldquo;Fed Up&rdquo;), that has become a potent force at the heart of resistance to Mr. Wade&rsquo;s efforts to stay in office despite his previous promises and constitutional provisions to the contrary.        

Though the group is based here in the capital, Dakar, where opposition parties and politicians have the most support, Y&rsquo;En A Marre remains officially unaligned. Ever since the group was formed in January, its leaders have vowed that they will not be co-opted by establishment politicians from richer neighborhoods, instead sticking to their roots in the rough, working-class district of Parcelles Assainies &mdash; the name translates as &ldquo;cleaned-up lots.&rdquo;
