BAGHDAD (AP) &mdash; A powerful anti-American Shiite cleric on Sunday reiterated his threat to have his thousands of followers attack any United States troops that stay past the current Dec. 31 deadline to leave Iraq.        

The threat, by Moktada al-Sadr and posted on his Web site, followed the Iraqi government&rsquo;s decision last week to open talks with Washington about keeping some troops here beyond year&rsquo;s end. But worried about a potential backlash, Iraqi officials have tried to portray any American soldiers who remained as trainers of the growing Iraqi military rather than as combat troops.        

Part of what American troops do in Iraq now is training. But they also assist in Iraqi counterterrorism operations and, if under attack, defend themselves.        

While security in Iraq has improved in recent years, attacks are still common. In June, 15 American soldiers were killed, making it the bloodiest month for the United States military here in two years. Nearly all of the deaths were in attacks by Shiite militias bent on forcing out American troops on schedule.        

&ldquo;They will be treated as anyone who stays in Iraq, as a tyrannical occupier that must be resisted by military means,&rdquo; Mr. Sadr said in his statement, partly aimed at Iraqi political leaders. &ldquo;The government which agrees to them staying, even if it is for training, is a weak government.&rdquo;
