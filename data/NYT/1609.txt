Hundreds of minority Christians protested in Katmandu, the capital, on Wednesday, demanding that the government provide them with designated burial grounds. Christians complain that there are only a handful of places where they can bury their dead. Nepal is predominantly Hindu, and most bodies are cremated. About 1,000 Christians held banners that read &ldquo;Give us our rights, give us burial grounds&rdquo; and demonstrated in the center of the city. Christians have been protesting since a ban was imposed earlier this year on a traditional burial area next to a revered Hindu temple in Katmandu. The Supreme Court has temporarily lifted the ban, but the dispute continues. The government pledged last month to find land near Katmandu for Christians to bury their dead, but no progress has been made.
