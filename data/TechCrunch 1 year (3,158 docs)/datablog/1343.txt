Editor’s note: James Altucher is an investor, programmer, author, and entrepreneur. He is Managing Director of Formula Capital and has written 6 books on investing. His latest books are I Was Blind But Now I See and FAQ ME. You can follow him @jaltucher.Im a complete sexist. I want women to look as good as possible. And Im not the only one. Women want to look as sexy as possible. Thats why they buy hundreds of millions worth of form-fitting Spanx every year. And now Sara Blakely, the founder of Spanx is worth a billion according to Forbes. She took Justin Timberlakes advice. A million is not cool. A billion is cool.So what happened next? In the past 24 hours Ive heard three different guys say something to the affect of, She? She is worth a billion? Huh. I guess anyone can be worth a billion. As soon as someone says that they are scratched off my list of people I want to spend time with. I only like to be around positive people who celebrate success.I hold a Twitter Q&A session every Thursday EST from 3:30-4:30. I answer every question asked. Then I expand further into a blog post. Then Ive taken all the blog posts, expanded further with original material plus added material from questions asked me via email and I compiled the results into a book I just self-published called FAQ ME.(click on cover to go to book page)
