ISMAILIA, Egypt (Reuters) &mdash; Saboteurs blew up a pipeline carrying natural gas from Egypt to Israel and Jordan on Monday, forcing the line to shut down, Egyptian security sources said.        

The explosion took place in the early morning at a station in the northern Sinai Peninsula at Bir Abd, 37 miles east of the Suez Canal, the sources said.        

It was the third attack this year on the pipeline, which also supplies local cement plants and a power station.        

A security source said men with machine guns forced guards at the station to leave, then planted explosive charges.        

&ldquo;We do not have sufficient information until now, but in principle the explosion happened in the same way that the two previous explosions happened,&rdquo; another security source said.        

Explosions in April and February closed the pipeline for weeks.        

Although repairs were made quickly, disputes over security stopped the flow of gas.
