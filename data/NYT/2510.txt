Newly discovered documents indicate that the British government concealed how often it administered &ldquo;virginity tests&rdquo; to female immigrants hoping to enter the country in the 1970s on marriage visas. The documents, unearthed by Marinella Marmo and Evan Smith, legal researchers from Flinders University in Australia, showed that the tests had been administered more than 80 times at the British Embassies in New Delhi and Mumbai. Although the tests, ostensibly to weed out bogus immigration claims, first drew condemnation in the late 1970s, the extent to which the practice had taken place was not clear until now. The British government had previously acknowledged only two cases, both done at Heathrow Airport.
