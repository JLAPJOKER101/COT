Gunmen killed several supporters of a politician in Nigeria&rsquo;s oil-producing Niger Delta on Friday during a gathering at his home, the latest act of political violence ahead of elections in April. Supporters of Timi Alaibe, who quit as presidential adviser on the Niger Delta last month to run for the governorship of Bayelsa State, were attacked during a reception to welcome him back from the capital, Abuja, witnesses said. Initial reports said two people were killed by attackers armed with guns and machetes, but witnesses later said they believed four people died and two were critically injured.
