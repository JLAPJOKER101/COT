Sure, other sites might have footage of Ice Cream Sandwich (Android 4.0.) They grabbed a Galaxy Nexus, fumbled with it for a second or two, and then shot 2-3 minutes of video with a device/interface they werent really familiar with. And thats fine.But I didnt want to do that — I wanted us to do it right. Late last night, I caught up with Androids Engineering Director Dave Burke for an in-depth, 15 minute video showing the full array of Ice Cream Sandwichs finest features.Want to skip around a bit?
