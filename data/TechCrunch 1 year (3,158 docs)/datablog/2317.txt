Wed been wondering why T-Mobile was lurking about at Googles Music event, and weve finally cleared things up: T-Mobile will be Google Musics first carrier partner, allowing their subscribers to charge their track purchases directly to their monthly bill.This isnt the first time T-Mobile has been quick to have Googles back; the worlds first Android phone, the G1, launched exclusively on T-Mobiles shelves months before anyone else had an Android handset of their own.They were also the first US carrier to support carrier billing for purchases made through the Android Market — an integration which todays move obviously builds upon.T-Mobile also claims that theyll have a fair amount of Google Music content available exclusively for their subscribers — but outside of some free tracks from Drake and Maroon 5, they didnt make many suggestions on what that might be. Dont worry, though, non-T-Mo folks: you probably wont be missing out on anything too crucial.
