Prime Minister Meles Zenawi of Ethiopia called on Friday for the creation of &ldquo;corridors of humanitarian assistance&rdquo; in neighboring Somalia to ease the delivery of life-saving aid. A famine is steadily spreading across southern Somalia but the Shabab, a militant Islamist group, has been blocking many aid groups from reaching starving people. United Nations officials seemed cool to the idea of establishing humanitarian corridors, which can be a pretext for military intervention.
