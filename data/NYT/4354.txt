President Hugo Ch&aacute;vez of Venezuela said Wednesday that he planned to take control of the country&rsquo;s gold industry to halt illegal mining and bolster reserves, adding to nationalizations in the oil, metals and cement businesses. Mr. Ch&aacute;vez, speaking on state television, said he was preparing a decree increasing government control to stop illegal miners from exploiting deposits of gold and coltan, an ore containing tantalum, used in cellphones and video game consoles.
