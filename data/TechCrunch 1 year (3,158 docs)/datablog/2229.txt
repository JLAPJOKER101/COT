Earlier this year, Mogulite launched as the seventh site in Dan Abrams Media Metwork, which includes Mediaite, Geekosystem, Styleite, Sportsgrid, and The Mary Sue. At launch Mogulitefocused on chronicling the lives of moguls from the professional world, from Mark Cuban to Oprah Winfrey to Arianna Huffington. Today, Abrams is announcing that Mogulite is being rebranded next week as TheJaneDough, with a niche focus on content related to women in business.The editors that currently run Mogulite, Amy Tennery and Hilary Reinsberg, will continue to lead TheJaneDough. As Tennery explains, the stories written from the professional female perspective have attracted a lot of attention on the site and it made sense to refocus the content.Abrams says that TheJaneDough will call out sexism, highlight top female CEOs, with the tagline The business news we knead.This isnt the first female-focused site for Abrams empire. TheMarySue launched as a female-focused geek site in February.
