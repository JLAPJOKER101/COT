Chicago-based but Israeli-founded Future Simple, a startup that creates products aimed at small businesses, has released an Android app which hooks into their small business CRM. Its the first Small Business CRM with a true full native Android app and appears to be the first CRM in the Android Market. They already had an iPhone app.Curiously, Salesforce has released only a partial mobile app that is is quite limited. Future Simple is aiming directly at eating into small business users of Highrise and Salesforce. Indeed, so many users of Highrise are switching to Future Simple that the startups says had to build an automated import tool.This release is a part of a broader strategy to reach as many platforms as possible. Previously the company had two small business products: PipeJump, a small business sales tracking and CRM application, and QuoteBase, a project/job quote generator. Theyve now been merged into a super-intuitive, drag and drop interfaced product named Base.The company is currently in the process of raising a second round of funding. Founded in 2009 by Uzi Shmilovici, and joined by Polish maven Ela Madej (who leads business development), last year it raised a $1.1 million round led OCA Ventures with participation by the I2A Fund, as well as angel investors.
