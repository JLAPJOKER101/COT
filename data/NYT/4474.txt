The opposition leader Daw Aung San Suu Kyi said she was encouraged after meeting with the United Nations human rights envoy to Myanmar, formerly Burma. Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi said her 90-minute meeting in Yangon on Wednesday with Tom&aacute;s Ojea Quintana and leaders of her disbanded National League for Democracy focused on Myanmar&rsquo;s more than 2,000 political prisoners and other human rights issues. She said Mr. Quintana had a &ldquo;genuine will to help improve human rights conditions in Myanmar.&rdquo; Mr. Quintana said he had had &ldquo;fruitful meetings&rdquo; with government ministers and representatives of political parties. He will brief the news media on Thursday. His five-day visit to Myanmar is his first since a nominally civilian government took power in March. He was refused a visa for over a year.
