CARACAS, Venezuela &mdash; To the many comparisons that can been made between Venezuela and Cuba &mdash; two close allies, both infused with revolutionary zeal, driven by movements that revere their leaders &mdash; consider one more: the presidential brother, stepping in during a time of illness.        

As President Hugo Ch&aacute;vez quietly recovers in Cuba after undergoing emergency surgery there more than two weeks ago, no government figure has occupied the political void created by his absence more assertively than his older brother, Ad&aacute;n Ch&aacute;vez, a physicist whose radical thinking has often been to the left of the president&rsquo;s.        

He serves a role similar to that of Ra&uacute;l Castro, who took over as Cuba&rsquo;s president after illness removed Fidel Castro from the political scene in 2006. And like Ra&uacute;l Castro, while Ad&aacute;n Ch&aacute;vez may lack his brother&rsquo;s charisma, he remains a loyalist who has assisted his brother throughout the consolidation of power.        

A former Venezuelan ambassador to Cuba and long a member of Hugo Ch&aacute;vez&rsquo;s inner circle of advisers, Ad&aacute;n Ch&aacute;vez has taken on the role of providing public updates on his brother&rsquo;s convalescence, shuttling between Caracas and Havana in recent weeks. It was his disclosure last Wednesday that the president would not return to Venezuela for another 10 to 12 days that offered the most serious assessment yet of the president&rsquo;s slow recovery.        

Ad&aacute;n Ch&aacute;vez, 58, now governor of Barinas, a state of cattle ranches in western Venezuela that is a bastion of the Ch&aacute;vez family, has also led efforts to reassure and energize the president&rsquo;s supporters as rumors swirl about his condition. Citing Che Guevara at a prayer meeting in Barinas over the weekend, he rallied the president&rsquo;s followers and called on them to remember the armed struggle as a method of &ldquo;applying and developing the revolutionary program.&rdquo;        

&ldquo;It would be unforgivable to limit ourselves to only electoral or other methods of struggle,&rdquo; said Ad&aacute;n Ch&aacute;vez, a former university professor involved in political activity long before his brother, who is less than two years his junior, formed a nationalist cell of young army officers in the late 1970s.        

The prominence of Ad&aacute;n Ch&aacute;vez reflects his brother&rsquo;s dominance of Venezuelan politics since he was first elected president in 1998. Over the years, Hugo Ch&aacute;vez has consistently winnowed other top advisers and potential rivals who rose from his own political movement. Some who remain, like Vice President El&iacute;as Jaua, a former director of land expropriations, exhibit total loyalty. (Last week, Mr. Jaua read verbatim on state television the handful of Twitter messages Hugo Ch&aacute;vez wrote to followers.)        

Still, no one in the government, including Ad&aacute;n Ch&aacute;vez, has displayed the president&rsquo;s visceral ability to connect with poor Venezuelans. That may not have mattered too much in Cuba, where the Communist Party holds unrivaled authority over the nation&rsquo;s political system. But if Hugo Ch&aacute;vez is unable to quickly return to power in Venezuela, it remains to be seen how effectively his brother can hold off the spirited, if divided, opposition here and build support in a governing movement so centered around the president himself.        

Ad&aacute;n Ch&aacute;vez did not respond to interview requests. But biographers of Hugo Ch&aacute;vez attribute the president&rsquo;s political evolution, if not his bruising political style, in part to Ad&aacute;n&rsquo;s influence and ties in the 1970s with guerrilla leaders like Douglas Bravo, who advocated using Venezuela&rsquo;s petroleum reserves as a tool for radical change.        

While Hugo Ch&aacute;vez grew close to Mr. Bravo and then broke with him, as he has done repeatedly with other mentors, the president still incorporated such thinking into his own ideology, using oil revenues as the driving force in his socialist-inspired revolution.        

Now, Mr. Bravo, 79, who is a critic of what he describes as Venezuela&rsquo;s new dependence on countries like China and Russia, said Ad&aacute;n Ch&aacute;vez was clearly &ldquo;in the line of succession.&rdquo; Referring to Ad&aacute;n&rsquo;s statement about using arms to defend his brother&rsquo;s revolution, Mr. Bravo noted that neither the vice president nor any other prominent pro-Ch&aacute;vez political leader had said anything so provocative.        

&ldquo;He must be receiving orientation from his brother to say such a thing, because I don&rsquo;t think he would make such a declaration on his own,&rdquo; said Mr. Bravo, who has known both men for decades.
