Amazon Prime Video just got a shot of show tunes in the arm as the retailer just announced an extended licensing agreement with Twentieth Century Fox Television Distribution. Exact terms of the deal including the length of the agreement were not released. But that doesnt really matter. Glee! Amazon now has Glee!Starting today, Prime members have access to season one and two of FOXs Glee as a well as the first two seasons of FXs Sons of Anarchy (season three will be available on Christmas day). Future seasons of both shows will hit the service once theyre available.Amazon is on a roll propping up its Netflix competitor. The addition of these very popular shows adds to Prime Instant Videos growing collection of videos available to watch instantly on a number of devices including the Kindle Fire and several set-top boxes. Plus, with WhisperSync, viewers can pause the content on one device and resume watching it on another  a big selling point for the Kindle Fire.The Prime Instant Video plan is priced slightly differently than Netflix. Users must sign up for the $79 per year Amazon Prime plan, which includes access to the library of more than 13,000 movies and TV shows, but also nets the buyer free two-day shipping on most Amazon items and a discounted rate for overnight shipping. The company also just announced that Kindle owners who are also Prime members can borrow a book a month through the Kindle Owners Lending Library. As a Prime subscriber myself, I can profess that its an amazing service and for better or worse, will make you addicted to Amazons service. Plus now theres Glee! Lots and lots of Glee!(Full disclosure: I havent watched Glee in over a year and my life is better because of it.)
