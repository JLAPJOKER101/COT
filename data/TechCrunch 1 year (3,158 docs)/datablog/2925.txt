Location-based group chat. Its just one of those ideas that everyone seems to be convinced is a good one, but that no one has really pulled off well just yet.Tossing their chips into the local chat game today is Palringo, which began its life back in 2007 as the iPhones first multi-network IM client. Their kicker? Theyve already got an established userbase of around 11 million users.For the sake of full disclosure: Palringo will be in the StartupAlley at next weeks TechCrunch Disrupt. Given that I wasnt aware of this until well after I started writing this post, however, I can quite confidently say this didnt affect my decision to cover the update.With localized chat, there seems to be two different approaches: pinning clusters of users together automagically behind the scenes (a la Yobongo), or letting uses create/join geotagged rooms on their own. Palringo has gone with the latter.
