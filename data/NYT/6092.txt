China&rsquo;s government had been drafting new safety standards for school buses for two years when an accident last week killed 21 preschoolers and two adults, a state newspaper reported. Many Chinese were outraged by the crash, in which a nine-seat minivan crammed with 62 children rammed into a coal truck in Gansu Province. Xu Mei, a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Education who was quoted in The Legal Mirror of Beijing, said at least 10 government agencies had been researching school bus systems for two years &ldquo;and had collected good experience from schools with good solutions.&rdquo; She said the Education Ministry had ordered the standards to be quickly issued in the wake of the crash. &ldquo;The priority now,&rdquo; the article quoted her as saying, &ldquo;is to make sure that there will be no more accidents with existing school buses.&rdquo;
