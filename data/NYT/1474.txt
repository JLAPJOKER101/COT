The police found the body of a 4-year-old girl in Acapulco on Thursday who had been shot in the chest, the fifth child killed in drug-related violence in the city in less than a week. The child was in a car next to a woman who had been shot three times in the back, the Guerrero State police said in a statement. The police did not release the identities of the victims or discuss a possible motive for their killings. At least five young people have died in drug violence in Acapulco since Sunday, including a 2-year-old boy and a 6-year-old boy killed with an elderly woman who tried to shield them when gunmen opened fire at their home.
