Tristane Banon, the French writer who accused Dominique Strauss-Kahn of trying to rape her eight years ago, said she would not pursue a civil case against him, after French prosecutors recently declined to charge him with attempted rape. Last week, prosecutors said they could not bring a case against him, given a three-year statute of limitations for sexual assault, but they said there was evidence that he had sexually assaulted Ms. Banon. On Wednesday, Ms. Banon said she would not pursue a suit because the case had proved that she was not a liar.
