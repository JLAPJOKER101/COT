Twitter photo sharing service YFrog has deleted the account of Grace Dent, an influential UK Twitterer and writer with over 94,000 followers. There appears to be no explanation for the blunder at the moment but weve reached out to YFrog for comment.Twitter recently became the number one photo sharing service on its platform, handling 36% of shares, and YFrog is down to 21% from 29.3% five months ago, indicating a slow death.So it seems a massive blunder for YFrog to lose such an influential user. She has now switched to European startup MobyPicture.
