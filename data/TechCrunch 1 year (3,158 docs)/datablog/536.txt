Before we start getting even deeper into our analyses of which startups and products Apple killed today with its iOS 6 and other announcements, we should all remember that it basically tried to build Spotify with social music network Ping, and well, look how that turned out.I dont even need to ask for a moment of silence for Ping, because Apple already had it for me.
