Amazon is making it easier for its users to discover recommended content today with the launch of a new best of digital store, where consumers can find recommendations from Amazon’s team of editors on the years best of movies & TV shows, music, video games, software, mobile apps, magazines and Kindle books and more. Basically, Amazon will recommend the best of any type of digital content that the company sells. Of course, the timing of the launch is meant to coincide with holiday shopping season, which has historically brought record sales of digital content for Amazon. Last year, from Christmas Eve through December 30, Amazon customers purchased over three times more digital content, including Kindle books, magazines, movies, TV shows, music, and digital games as compared to the weekly average for the year.Amazon says that in terms of specific days, the company sees the largest jump in digital product sales on Christmas and during the week following the holiday.Amazon has published lists of its Best Sellers for Kindle books and other categories, but this appears to be a more curated, editorialized list of content from Amazon experts.A centralized place for Amazons top recommendations for more than just books and movies makes sense considering the growing number of consumers who are looking to the e-commerce giant for software, apps, TV shows and more.
