Title says it all. Well, except the fact that Yahoo CEO Carol Bartz was apparently fired over the phone. Harsh. This is the note Bartz just sent out to Yahoo employees:To all,I am very sad to tell you that Ive just been fired over the phone by Yahoos Chairman of the Board. It has been my pleasure to work with all of you and I wish you only the best going forward.CarolSent from my iPadWe noted in June that Yahoo was quietly looking for a replacement for Bartz — something which Yahoo (obviously) denied, and other press ate right up. Yahoo even talked about our post at their shareholders meeting and essentially called it bullshit. Funny.The moral of the story: how do you know a company is lying about something potentially damaging, even (and perhaps especially) in an official capacity? If their mouths are moving.Crazy day. Heres our favorite Bartz moment.
