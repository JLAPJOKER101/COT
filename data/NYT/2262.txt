KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) &mdash; A NATO airstrike this month killed a senior operative of Al Qaeda in Afghanistan who was a regional commander in charge of suicide bombings and cash flow, the international military coalition said Tuesday.        

NATO identified the man killed in the air attack on April 13 in the Dangam District of eastern Kunar Province as Abu Hafs al-Najdi, also known as Abdul Ghani. The military alliance said the strike also killed a number of other insurgents, including a Qaeda leader known as Waqas.        

Mr. Najdi, a Saudi, directed Al Qaeda&rsquo;s operations in Kunar Province and traveled regularly between Afghanistan and Pakistan, NATO said. He coordinated suicide bombing attacks and kidnappings, and oversaw the transfer of money.        

An American official in Washington described Mr. Najdi as a &ldquo;significant commander&rdquo; and said that he had been one of fewer than a dozen such Qaeda commanders in Afghanistan.        

NATO said it had been chasing Mr. Najdi since 2007 and finally found him while he was meeting with Mr. Waqas, who like many Afghans used only one name.        

In Paktia Province, the provincial governor narrowly escaped what appeared to be an assassination attempt. A roadside bomb exploded behind a vehicle that was taking the governor, Juma Khan Hamdard, to his office, said Rohallah Samon, a spokesman for the governor.        

Mr. Hamdard was not hurt, but three police officers in another vehicle were slightly wounded, Mr. Samon said.
