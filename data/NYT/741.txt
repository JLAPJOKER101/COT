Sharp government spending cuts have forced contentious choices on local authorities, perhaps none more so than one council&rsquo;s decision to heat a community swimming pool with energy diverted from a crematory. The council in Redditch, near Birmingham, has approved the diversion of waste heat from the crematory&rsquo;s incinerator to a next-door leisure center and its new pool. Councilor Carole Gandy said the plan was consistent with the need for energy efficiency and had been widely backed by local residents once officials had explained the technology involved, which she described as common elsewhere in Europe.  Labor union officials said the plan encapsulated the extremes forced on local authorities by national austerity cuts.  Roger McKenzie, regional secretary for Unison, Britain&rsquo;s largest public sector union, condemned the plan as &ldquo;sick and an insult to local residents.&rdquo;
