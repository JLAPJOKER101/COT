HANOI, Vietnam (AP) &mdash; Vo Chi Cong, who was president of Vietnam from 1987 to 1991, died Sept. 8 in southern Ho Chi Minh City. He was 99.        

His death was reported by the Communist Party newspaper Nhan Dan.        

Mr. Cong was born Vo Toan in central Quang Nam Province and joined the Communist Party in 1935. He gradually rose in the ranks. He was appointed deputy prime minister in 1976, a year after the end of the Vietnam War.        

Since retiring as an adviser to the ruling Communist Party in 1996, Mr. Cong rarely appeared at public events.
