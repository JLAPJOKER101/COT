Greek commandos boarded and turned back a Canadian boat bound for the Gaza Strip on Monday, in the latest setback for the all-but-stymied Gaza flotilla. The Hellenic Coast Guard stopped the boat about 20 minutes after it set sail from the island of Crete, organizers said, and impounded it at a military dock. Aboard were 43 activists from Canada, Australia, Belgium, Denmark, Germany and Turkey, said Sandra Ruch, a coordinator for the boat. The flotilla had planned to try to breach Israel&rsquo;s naval blockade of Gaza. Greek authorities turned back an American boat on Friday that had set sail from a port near Athens. The government had prohibited all vessels from departing Greek ports for the &ldquo;maritime area of Gaza&rdquo; in order to ensure the safety of passengers.
