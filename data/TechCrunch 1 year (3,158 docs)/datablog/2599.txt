In this episode of the TechCrunch Gadgets Webcast we assess the value of camera film, decide that Devin is the 6th Decemberist, and express how much we love Asus new ultrabook.We promise every week that well do these more often and we love doing them.

Would you prefer an audio podcast or should we strip the video for audio consumption? We, as you well know, are at your service.
