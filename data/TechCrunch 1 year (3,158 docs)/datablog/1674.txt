Man, it feels like its been forever since the last time weve seen a seemingly legit Apple leak. Maybe theyve tightened the security around the factory lines; maybe its because the last two major hardware releases were mostly indistinguishable from their predecessors at a distance, and were thus rather hard to photograph properly.Whatever the case, Chinese Apple blog Apple.pro has shots of what might be the next generation iPod Nano. It looks just like the current itty-bitty 6th generation nano, with one notable twist: its got a camera.As a bit of a recap, this was the 5th gen Nano. It had a camera:Then the 6th-gen came along, cutting the products size in half (at the expense of the camera, plus things like a built-in speaker):According to micgadget (who backs Apple.Pros pictures with their factory sources), the new Nanos camera resolution comes in at 1.3 megapixels (or 12801024). A bit paltry by modern standards â€” but if youve ever held one of the latest Nanos, you know how little space there is for things like lenses and light sensors. That they (reportedly) even fit such things in there at all is kind of ridiculous.
