An appeals court on Friday rejected a move by the pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi to have her political party reinstated. The party had been dissolved for boycotting last year&rsquo;s election. The Special Appellant Court in Naypyitaw ruled that the National League for Democracy, whose 1990 election victory was ignored by the military junta, will remain an &ldquo;unlawful association.&rdquo;
