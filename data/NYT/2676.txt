Authorities in Kazakhstan were trying to determine whether a man who blew himself up on Tuesday inside a government office building in a provincial town had links to Islamic radicals. If so, it would be the first known terrorist suicide bombing in oil-rich Kazakhastan. Governments in the region, including Russia, have expressed concern that violence from the Afghan war is spreading to formerly Soviet Central Asia. The attack wounded two bystanders at a local police headquarters in the city of Aktobe. Kazakh prosecutors said it appeared that the bomber had ties to organized crime but not to radical Islamic groups.
