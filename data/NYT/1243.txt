MEXICO CITY &mdash; An experiment in law enforcement in a drug-ravaged border town ended Monday when the 20-year-old police chief was fired after failing to turn up for work.        

The police chief, Marisol Valles Garc&iacute;a, a college criminology student, had been hired in October after nobody else would take the job. To avoid provoking the drug gangs warring for control of the area, she did not carry a gun or wear a uniform, and made it clear that she would leave major crimes to higher authorities.        

Last week, she had asked for a three-day leave to care for her baby son, and there was speculation that she had been threatened. But when she did not show up for work on Monday, the mayor of Pr&aacute;xedis G. Guerrero, a small town near Ciudad Ju&aacute;rez, fired her.        

Nobody knows for certain where she is, or whether there she had been threatened.        

Andr&eacute;s Morales Arreola, the municipal secretary, said she appeared to have left town with her family.        

Gustavo de la Rosa Hickerson, a state human rights ombudsman, said a witness saw her safely cross a bridge into El Paso last week. But noting the threats law enforcement officials face &mdash; a previous police chief had been beheaded &mdash; he criticized the mayor for &ldquo;an act of abandonment.&rdquo;        

Town officials, however, were not alarmed.        

&ldquo;We&rsquo;re confident that she is safe in some place,&rdquo; Mr. Morales said. &ldquo;If there were some kind of situation, we would have known about it. That kind of news just flies.&rdquo;        

In its statement, the mayor&rsquo;s office said it &ldquo;wished her the best in any future projects she may take on.&rdquo;
