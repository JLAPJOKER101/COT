A bomb explosion followed by a suicide attack outside a military academy killed at least 18 officers in training on Friday, a hospital official said. The attack began when a bomb exploded just outside the academy in Cherchel, 112 miles west of the capital, Algiers. When soldiers dining at a nearby restaurant raced to the scene, a suicide bomber with explosives strapped to his body drove his motorcycle at them, security officials said. The city was sealed off soon after the attack. At least 20 people were wounded, and the toll was expected to rise. There was no immediate claim of responsibility, but the regional arm of Al Qaeda, Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, has been blamed for many similar attacks.
