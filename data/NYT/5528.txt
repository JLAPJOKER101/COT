Parliament adopted a law on Friday limiting abortions but rejected tougher restrictions backed by the Russian Orthodox Church. The law limits abortions to 12 weeks of pregnancy, except for women who say they cannot afford a child, who may have an abortion up to 22 weeks. The law also requires a waiting period of two to seven days. The law does not include restrictions proposed by the church, such as a husband&rsquo;s consent for married women and parents&rsquo; consent for teenage girls.
