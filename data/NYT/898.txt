The Chinese Foreign Ministry on Thursday denied a report that Chinese and Russian companies had agreed to start a joint venture in islands that are disputed by Russia and Japan. Kyodo News, a Japanese news agency, had reported that the companies intended to farm sea cucumbers, a delicacy among Chinese, on one of four islands near the northeast coast of Hokkaido, Japan. Russia has reportedly invited enterprises from other countries to invest in businesses there, but so far there has been no third-party investment. &ldquo;The issue regarding the four northern islands is a bilateral issue between Russia and Japan, and we hope the two sides will properly handle the issue through talks,&rdquo; said Ma Zhaoxu, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, according to official Chinese news reports.
