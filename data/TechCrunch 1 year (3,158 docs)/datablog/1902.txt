The rights to Casa.com (Spanish for house) have been transferred to Amazon, indicating the ecommerce giants next dedicated vertical shop may be a home decor site. Amazons Quidsi network of sites already runs diapers.com for baby goods, wag.com for pets, beautybar.com for  well, you get it. If you visit Casa.com now youll find more evidence, with a blank screen explaining You have reached an invalid location. Maybe you are looking for http://www.diapers.com, http://www.soap.com Casa.com could offer a more affordable, traditional home decor shopping alternative to luxury and flash sales sites like One Kings Lane and Gilts Decorati.Domain Name Wire first reported on the domain switch, noting that casa.com was protected by whois privacy for years prior to the transfer. Also, I found that Quidsi employee Morgan C. lists herself on LinkedIn as a Merchandising Associate at Quidsi Inc., Casa.com, and Domain Name Wire spotted another Quidsi employee with the same title. You wont find that logo above anywhere else though, its just a mockup I concocted.Amazon bought Diapers.com parent Quidsi for $545 million in November 2010. When Quidsi  launched Yoyo.com for toys in September 2011, its CEO Marc Lore told TechCrunch that the companys next vertical site was going to continue its focus its core demographic of moms. Casa.com fits that bill perfectly.The new one-stop shop could include standard Quidsi features such as a combined shopping cart with other Quidsi sites, free 2-day shipping for purchases over $50, seasonal product selections, and featured picks by the sites team. Considering One Kings Lane was expected to do $100 million in 2011 sales, the home decor market could be a huge opportunity for Amazon.[Image Credit: Shutterstock]
