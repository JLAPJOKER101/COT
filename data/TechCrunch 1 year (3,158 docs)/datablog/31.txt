Doug Purdy, Facebooks Director of Developer Products, just announced that 230 million people played games on Facebook.com in the past 30 days and that 8 of the 10 top grossing iPhone apps are integrated with Facebook. This is an interesting bit of news when thinking about actual user interaction with the service and what third party developers could expect to see when building for the platform.Facebook offers games directly on Facebook.com as well as an SDK to push data from standalone apps on Android and iPhone to Facebook. Both of these traffic sources are obviously quite sticky and quite valuable.Considering, according to Chris Dixon, that 10 million users is the new 1 million users, its clear Facebook is still a growth engine in the online space in terms of traffic, engagement, and monetization.Purdy also noted that Facebook drove people to the App Store and Google Play 150 million times in the past 30 days, bolstering its value as an advertising platform.
