Drug smugglers were caught last week trying to hurl drugs over the  border fence with a catapult, authorities said. Acting on a tip from the  United States Border Patrol,  the Mexican military seized the metal-framed catapult,  powered by  heavy-duty elastic and mounted on a trailer, and 45 pounds of marijuana, near Naco, Ariz., last Friday.
