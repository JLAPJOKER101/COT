KABUL, Afghanistan &mdash; The Iranian Foreign Ministry expressed its displeasure to Afghanistan&rsquo;s ambassador to Iran over an American drone aircraft that Iran says flew deep into its airspace and crashed last week, a spokesman for the Afghan Foreign Ministry said Sunday.        

According to Afghan officials, the drone was flown from the American and Afghan base at Shindand in western Herat Province. American officials have acknowledged the loss of an RQ-170, a C.I.A. stealth drone made by Lockheed Martin and designed to fly covert missions and collect information in hostile territory, but have declined to confirm or deny that it is the plane that Iran says it recovered.        

The Afghan ambassador, Obaidullah Obaid, discussed the matter with Iranian officials and promised to look into the circumstances, said Janan Mosazai, a spokesman for Afghanistan&rsquo;s Foreign Ministry.        

Such overflights are an example of the difficult position that President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan has been put in by the American presence. Mr. Karzai has repeatedly promised that Afghanistan will not allow the Americans or anyone else to use Afghan soil to mount attacks on its neighbors. While the drone that Iran says it recovered was not armed, Iran views the overflights as hostile.
