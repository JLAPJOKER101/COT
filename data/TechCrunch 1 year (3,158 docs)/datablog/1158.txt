Your home machine, one or two Gmail inboxes, a Dropbox account  many of us have a variety of documents relevant to our work and personal lives in at least two of these different places. And when it comes time to actually access one of those files again, it can be pretty time-consuming to figure out where it is and make sure its exactly the one youre looking for.A new app called Found aims to bring some cohesion to this personal data diaspora. Found, which is available now in private beta, is an app for the Mac that lets you find and access your documents whether they are on your computer or online. As is the case with most good apps, the genius to Found is in its execution. Found looks great, is very fast, and has been built with some really thoughtful features. For now, Found plugs into Gmail, Google Documents, and Dropbox. The company says there will be integrations to let you search across more applications, such as Evernote, in the very near future. If you want to try out Found, you can sign up for an invite at the companys website  a public release of the app is scheduled for mid-May 2012. Screenshot of Found file search (click to enlarge)
