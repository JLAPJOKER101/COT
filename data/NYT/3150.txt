KABUL, Afghanistan &mdash; Four Afghan police officers were killed on Friday when a suicide bomber tried to force his way into a memorial service being held for a popular police commander in northern Afghanistan who was killed in an earlier Taliban attack.        

The memorial service for Gen. Daoud Daoud, held at a mosque in the northern city of Kunduz, was crowded with police and government officials when a suicide bomber tried to enter but was stopped by police officers outside the building, where he detonated his explosives. The blast wounded 14 additional police officers, said Sayid Sarwar Hussaini, the spokesman for the Kunduz police chief. Four civilians were also wounded, he said, two of them critically.        

General Daoud, the regional police commander for northern Afghanistan, was killed May 28 by a bomb hidden in a building where a security meeting had been convened in Taliqan, the capital of Takhar Province. The bomb also killed the provincial police chief and two German soldiers, and wounded the German NATO commander in northern Afghanistan, Maj. Gen. Markus Kneip.        

Mr. Hussaini said that the target of Friday&rsquo;s bombing was apparently the Kunduz police chief, Samiullah Qatra, but that officers guarding the mosque shot the bomber and prevented him from entering the building. The explosion killed and wounded police guards stationed outside, he said.        

Last March, the police chief of Kunduz, Gen. Abdul Rahman Saidkhaili, was killed by a suicide bomber who attacked him just outside his office. Last October, the governor of Kunduz Province, Muhammad Omar, was killed by a suicide bomber who entered a mosque while Mr. Omar was praying. That attack also took place in Taliqan.
