The Ministry of Finance will repeal three rules on Friday that favor Chinese companies in competitions for government technology purchases, according to a statement posted this week on the ministry&rsquo;s Web site. China has long supported a policy of &ldquo;indigenous innovation,&rdquo; which grants advantages to Chinese companies over foreign rivals, especially in technology industries, and tries to enforce technology transfer from foreign companies in business deals. Foreign companies and governments have complained that such rules violate free-trade agreements. In January, when President Hu Jintao of China visited the White House, Chinese officials promised to drop some of those rules.
