Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi of Italy was dealt a resounding blow on Monday when Mayor Letizia Moratti, left, of Milan failed to avoid a runoff in her bid for re-election. Mr. Berlusconi had staked his reputation in support of Ms. Moratti and had campaigned strenuously for her. But with two-thirds of the votes counted, the center-left candidate Giuliano Pisapia was well out in front, but was short of a majority. The runoff election will be in two weeks.
