The United States disavowed torture on Friday and pledged to treat terrorism suspects humanely, but rejected calls to drop the death penalty, as the United Nations carried out its first review of Washington&rsquo;s human rights record. At the Human Rights Council in Geneva, the American envoy, Harold Koh, said the United States would agree to improvements in areas including civil rights, national security and immigration, and would not tolerate torture or the inhumane treatment of suspects at the Guant&aacute;namo Bay detention facility in Cuba. But he said the United States would not change its policy on the death penalty, which critics say is inhumane and unfairly applied. Mr. Koh said capital punishment was permitted under international law.
