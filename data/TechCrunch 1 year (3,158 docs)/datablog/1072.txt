Subscription flower delivery Service H.Bloom, which once described itself as the Netflix of Flowers, raised a $10 million Series B funding round today. The investment was lead by Shasta Ventures with the participation of a number of existing VC funds and angel investors, including Battery Ventures, Thomas Lehrman of Gerson Lerhman Group, and ShoeDazzles Brian Lee. Shastas Sean Flynn is also joining the H.Bloom board. In total, including this round, H.Bloom has now raised $18 million.H.Bloom was founded almost exactly two years ago. The New York-based service currently operates in four metropolitan areas (New York City, Chicago, San Francisco and Washington, D.C.) and has 53 employees.As H.Bloom CEO Bryan Burkhart told me earlier today, the floral business is a sleepy but $35 billion industry thats ripe for disruption. The company plans to use this funding round to build out its marketing and sales operations, as well as to make its delivery infrastructure more efficient. Most importantly, though, Burkhart said, H.Bloom will use this money to expand into new cities, but he wouldnt say which specific metropolitan areas the company is targeting for this expansion.The concept behind the service is pretty straightforward and indeed very Netflix-like. After you sign up, H.Bloom will regularly deliver a fresh bouquet of your choice to your door. You can choose how often per month you would like these fresh flowers to arrive (weekly, bi-weekly and monthly). The price for this service starts at $29.99 and goes up from there (orchids are $85 per bouquet).
