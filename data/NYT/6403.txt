HAVANA &mdash; The day after Havana is invaded by the living dead, Juan and Sara emerge from their dilapidated apartment building to find the streets filled with people roving aimlessly, their wide eyes blank.        

&ldquo;It all looks the same to me,&rdquo; Sara shrugs.        

The suggestion that 52 years of socialist rule have turned Cuba into a zombie state, a central conceit of the new Cuban horror spoof &ldquo;Juan of the Dead,&rdquo; is daringly irreverent satire in a country that takes its revolution with deadly seriousness.        

But instead of being forced underground, the movie was included in an officially sanctioned film festival last week where Cubans flocked to see it in such numbers that the police had to intervene and extra screenings were added. Its camp humor notwithstanding, this crude, low-budget splatter film has become an improbable landmark in the gradual opening of Cuban culture.        

&ldquo;Cinema reflects what&rsquo;s going on around us,&rdquo; said Carlos Hernandez, 47, a street performer who was among the 1,300 people in the audience at a screening on Thursday. &ldquo;There are openings. The walls around what you can and can&rsquo;t say are starting to crumble.        

&ldquo;There&rsquo;s an irreverence in the movie that reflects the wider irreverence felt by a lot of young people.&rdquo;        

&ldquo;Juan of the Dead&rdquo; is by no means the first Cuban film to examine the darker aspects of life on the island or to poke fun at Cubans&rsquo; hardships. Several feature films produced over the past two decades, with or without state sponsorship, have critiqued issues like homosexuality, exile and social inequality.        

But Juan&rsquo;s gleefully mischievous pot shots at Cuban sacred cows, from government-controlled media to Fidel Castro himself, are unusually risqu&eacute;, reflecting a growing cinematic freedom in a country where open criticism of the political system is barely tolerated. Because they are embedded in the constructs of a popular action genre, the film&rsquo;s cheeky gags are ensured a broad audience.        

The shifts in Cuba&rsquo;s film industry mirror the broader reality on the island, where President Ra&uacute;l Castro has gradually reduced the role of the state, cutting subsidies and public-sector jobs and opening space for private enterprise in a bid to salvage the economy.        

Filmmakers and moviegoers said the zombie film, Cuba&rsquo;s first, reflected an emerging diversity in Cuban film as less-expensive digital technology has allowed an explosion of independent movie production. It also signaled the coming of age of a group of filmmakers who grew up during the post-Soviet era, when the destitute Cuban state lost its near-monopoly on Cuban cinema.        

For decades, the state-financed Cuban Institute of Cinematic Art and Industry controlled the production and distribution of Cuban film and to a large extent defined Cuban cinema, which was viewed as an important pillar of the revolution. The institute produced some highly acclaimed films, including Tom&aacute;s Guti&eacute;rrez Alea&rsquo;s &ldquo;Memories of Underdevelopment&rdquo; in 1968, and the Oscar-nominated &ldquo;Strawberry and Chocolate,&rdquo; about the relationship between a gay man and a committed Communist, in 1993.        

But the institute&rsquo;s budget dropped dramatically after the fall of the Soviet Union, and it turned to joint productions with countries like Spain to survive.        

The digital revolution, which took off in Cuba over the past 10 years, kindled a surge in independent film, from shorts and video clips to features.        

Film experts said the fact that the five Cuban feature films in competition at the International Festival of New Latin American Cinema this year were shot digitally, most of them with minimal input from the institute, was a watershed.        

&ldquo;It is a reflection of what&rsquo;s going on in Cuban cinema,&rdquo; said Juan Carlos Cremata, a Cuban director whose ultra-low-budget feature film &ldquo;Chamaco&rdquo; is competing at the festival. &ldquo;The most interesting things happening in cinema today are happening outside the institute.&rdquo;        

Mr. Cremata said he made &ldquo;Chamaco,&rdquo; which deals with sexual exploitation and abuse, without institutional help so he could retain creative independence.        

&ldquo;Juan of the Dead&rdquo; &mdash; the title is an homage to the campy zombie touchstone &ldquo;Dawn of the Dead&rdquo; and its spoof &ldquo;Shaun of the Dead&rdquo; &mdash; cost about $3 million, the most expensive Cuban movie to be produced on the island with private financing and virtually no input from the institute. It was produced by a Spanish company and one founded by young Cuban filmmakers.        

&ldquo;Juan of the Dead&rdquo; tells the blood-drenched tale of a slacker who decides to save the island from an invasion of cannibalistic zombies. As the zombies turn Havana into a gory circus of flying limbs and severed heads, the nightly news anchors continue to calmly assert the government line, that the attacks are not the work of the undead but dissidents in the pay of the United States.        

The film is scattered with allusions to traumatic moments in Cuba&rsquo;s recent history: Cubans flee the zombies in makeshift boats that recall the raft-borne exodus of 1994; the darkened, shuttered streets, one character says, echo the &ldquo;special period&rdquo; of economic hardship after the collapse of the Soviet Union.        

&ldquo;Cuban reality is so incredible that there are things in the movie that seem like you made them up, but in fact they are based on truth,&rdquo; said Alejandro Brugu&eacute;s, the 35-year-old director, who was born in Argentina but grew up in Cuba. &ldquo;I just put zombies in the scenario, instead of real people.&rdquo;        

Mr. Brugu&eacute;s insisted that that the film is &ldquo;social commentary, not political.&rdquo;        

Still, the movie includes a couple of digs at the paramount leader of the revolution, Fidel Castro, who is rarely the butt of jests on the big screen. The last zombie standing, with his back to the audience as the credits roll, wears a familiar olive-green uniform with the revolutionary motto &ldquo;Until victory, always&rdquo; emblazoned on his jacket.
