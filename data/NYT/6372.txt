A suicide bomber in eastern Afghanistan killed six Afghan security officials, including a district police chief, during Friday Prayer in Ghaziabad District, a remote area of Kunar Province where there was an extensive NATO operation in October to clear the area of the Taliban. The bomber struck just outside a mosque where the officers had gone to pray. Two civilians were also killed, the Kunar governor said. In southern Afghanistan, seven detainees being held on narcotics trafficking charges escaped from a prison in Helmand Province, local officials said. Four employees at the prison, which is inside the police headquarters in Lashkar Gah, the provincial capital, were arrested in connection with the escape.
