Two nuclear plant workers have exceeded Japan&rsquo;s radiation exposure limit, and others who toiled without sufficient protection in the earliest days of the disaster could show high levels as well, the government and the plant&rsquo;s operator said Friday. About 40 other workers at the Fukushima Daiichi plant are being tested further after preliminary findings showed high exposures, according to Tepco, the power company. The two men are not showing immediate health problems but have an increased lifetime risk of cancer, a company spokesman said.
