Pope Benedict XVI used Twitter for the first time on Tuesday, announcing the start of a Vatican news information portal. Benedict&rsquo;s message read: &ldquo;Dear Friends, I just launched News.va Praised be our Lord Jesus Christ! With my prayers and blessings, Benedictus XVI.&rdquo; The portal www.news.va, aggregating information from the Vatican&rsquo;s various print, broadcast and online media, is an effort to deliver an evangelizing message to a greater audience through the Internet. It follows forays by the Vatican onto Facebook and YouTube. Benedict put the site online himself by tapping an iPad and then sent the Twitter message. Thaddeus Jones, project coordinator and an official with the Pontifical Council for Social Communications, said the pope, 84, was &ldquo;clearly in awe at the new technology.&rdquo;
