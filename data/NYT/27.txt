SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) &mdash; An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.1 shook southern Chile on Sunday, prompting tens of thousands to flee the coast for higher ground amid fears it could generate a tsunami, like the one that ravaged the area last year.        

There were no reports of deaths or damage, and Vicente Nu&ntilde;ez, head of the National Emergency Office, said no tsunami alert was issued.        

In an address to the nation, President Sebasti&aacute;n Pi&ntilde;era urged calm. &ldquo;There was an exercise of self-evacuation, which is exactly what we have asked people to do,&rdquo; Mr. Pi&ntilde;era said. &ldquo;Fortunately we do not have to lament accidents or losses of life.&rdquo;        

Some electrical power was knocked out in the Araucan&iacute;a region, where the earthquake was centered, 370 miles south-southwest of the capital, Santiago.        

In Araucan&iacute;a, Puerto Saavedra, Tolt&eacute;n and Teodoro Smith, about 50,000 people evacuated to higher ground, Mr. Nu&ntilde;ez said.
