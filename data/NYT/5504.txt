RIO DE JANEIRO &mdash; President Hugo Ch&aacute;vez of Venezuela declared on Thursday that he had beaten cancer, less than five months after he stunned Venezuelans by revealing that he had undergone emergency surgery to remove a tumor while in seclusion in Cuba.        

&ldquo;No abnormal cellular activity exists,&rdquo; said Mr. Ch&aacute;vez in comments broadcast on state media while on a visit to western Venezuela, where he was preparing to visit a Roman Catholic shrine. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve begun to exit the cave,&rdquo; said the president, dressed in a green military uniform.        

Despite Mr. Ch&aacute;vez&rsquo;s announcement, which he made after a brief trip to Cuba for a checkup, mystery still shrouds his condition. He has never publicly revealed what type of cancer afflicted him. Altogether, Mr. Ch&aacute;vez, 57, underwent four chemotherapy treatments, including three in Cuba and one in Venezuela, according to the government.        

Physically, he still looked like a changed man on Thursday, appearing bloated and with a green military cap covering a bald head. Spiritually, Mr. Ch&aacute;vez also seems to have acquired a more religious air. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m more Christian every day,&rdquo; he said Thursday. &ldquo;Socialism is the road to Christ.&rdquo;        

Confusion persists in Venezuela about how healthy or sick Mr. Ch&aacute;vez may be. Salvador Navarrete, a prominent Venezuelan doctor who describes himself as the president&rsquo;s former personal surgeon, said this week that Mr. Ch&aacute;vez had less than two years to live, attributing his illness to a &ldquo;very aggressive&rdquo; tumor in the pelvic area.        

Dr. Navarrete, a former militant in Mr. Ch&aacute;vez&rsquo;s political movement, said he drew his conclusions from recent discussions with Mr. Ch&aacute;vez&rsquo;s family. He made his claims in an interview with M Semanal, the weekly magazine of the Mexican newspaper Milenio.        

In the interview, Dr. Navarrete offered other details about Mr. Ch&aacute;vez&rsquo;s health. He said the president had been treated for bipolar disorder, and that Mr. Ch&aacute;vez smoked cigarettes at times of tension in his private chambers and consumed copious amounts of coffee throughout the day.        

An employee in Dr. Navarrete&rsquo;s office in Caracas said he was unavailable for comment. State media has dismissed Dr. Navarrete&rsquo;s claims, with Mario Silva, the host of a nightly program that disparages Mr. Ch&aacute;vez&rsquo;s opposition, contending that Dr. Navarrete was never the president&rsquo;s physician.        

Private Venezuelan news organizations reported this week that the officials from the Sebin, Mr. Ch&aacute;vez&rsquo;s secret intelligence police, had appeared at Dr. Navarrete&rsquo;s office this week to question him.        

Mr. Ch&aacute;vez, while refraining from discussing the specifics of his tumor, looked ahead on Thursday to next year&rsquo;s presidential elections. Taunting his opponents, he said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s easier for a donkey to pass through the eye of a needle than for you to beat me.&rdquo;
