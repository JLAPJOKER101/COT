The German authorities reported three deaths from a strain of the E. coli bacterium and warned that more were likely because of a &ldquo;scarily high&rdquo; number of infections. Investigators had not pinpointed the cause of the outbreak, said Reinhard Burger, left, president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany&rsquo;s disease control agency. About 200 cases were reported in the northern state of Schleswig-Holstein, 96 in Lower Saxony and 42 in the city of Hamburg. Most of the people who have been infected are adult women, officials said; previous outbreaks had affected mostly children.
