By blacking out the default Firefox start page and using social media, Mozilla reached 40 million people with its anti-SOPA/PIPA message. According to a stats wrap-up just posted to the Mozilla blog, 30 million people in the US saw the start pages call to action, 1.8 million visited its mozilla.org/SOPA info page, and the effort generated 360,000 emails to Congress.Additionally, Mozilla sent out messages to 9 million people via Facebook, Twitter, and its Firefox + You newsletter, over 20,000 retweeted or Liked these messages, and Mozilla drove 600,000 visits to the EFFs Strike Against Censorship Page.For comparison, heres how Ars Technica and others tabulated the contributions of some big web properties:Mozillas action didnt have the scale of Wikipedia or Googles effort, but it should still be commended for doing its part. Next week when the Senate votes, well see if yesterdays web-wide protest made a difference.For more info on the protests and their impact, check out TechCrunchs stream of online piracy legislation coverage[Image Credit: SayNotes]
