LISBON (AP) &mdash; George Wright, the fugitive murderer who was captured in Portugal on Monday after 39 years, will seek to prevent the United States from extraditing him by claiming a new identity, his lawyer said on Saturday.        

Mr. Wright, 68, became a Portuguese citizen called Jose Luis Jorge dos Santos in 1991 after marrying a Portuguese woman, the lawyer, Manuel Luis Ferreira, said.        

Mr. Ferreira said Mr. Wright&rsquo;s new identity was given to him by Guinea-Bissau, in west Africa, when it granted him political asylum in the 1980s, and was accepted by Portugal. Mr. Wright holds what appears to be a valid Portuguese passport issued in 2007.        

The American authorities are trying to extradite Mr. Wright to serve the remainder of his 15- to 30-year sentence for killing a man in New Jersey in 1962 during a gas station robbery. He broke out of prison in New Jersey in 1970, and in 1972, dressed as a priest, the authorities say, he and several others boarded a plane in Detroit bound for Miami and hijacked it to Algeria.        

Mr. Ferreira said his client was arguing that he had the right to serve out his murder sentence in Portugal because of his Portuguese citizenship.        

&ldquo;As a Portuguese citizen, if he has to answer to any authority or if he has to serve any sentence, it has to be to Portuguese authorities and in Portuguese territory,&rdquo; Mr. Ferreira said.        

A spokeswoman for the United States Justice Department declined to comment on Mr. Ferreira&rsquo;s arguments because the case was pending.        

A judge is expected to rule on the extradition request in the coming weeks. If Mr. Wright loses, he could appeal to higher courts in what would likely be a lengthy process.
