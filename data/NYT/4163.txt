Sudan&rsquo;s United Nations envoy on Friday rejected accusations from a United Nations official who said the government delayed a helicopter trying to evacuate three wounded peacekeepers. The peacekeeping chief, Alain Le Roy, had said that the peacekeepers died on Tuesday while Sudan refused requests to let them be flown out for medical care. The Sudanese envoy, Daffa-Alla Elhag Ali Osman, said the flight had not been delayed. &ldquo;When you request approval for a plane from a remote area in the wilderness there is a process to follow,&rdquo; he said. Approval for the flight was given in less than three hours, he said, &ldquo;normal in an area where there are military clashes.&rdquo;
