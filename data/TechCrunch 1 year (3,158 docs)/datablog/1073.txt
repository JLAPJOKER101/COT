Publisher Condé Nast has acquired ZipList, an online service that allows users to save recipes and turn them into ingredient shopping lists.AllThingsDs Peter Kafka is reporting that the acquisition price was $14 million, including earnouts for some employees. Ive asked a company spokesperson to confirm the amount, but I havent heard back.Last month, the company announced that it has been used by more than 1 million people. Founder and CEO Geoff Allen also told me that ZipList was focusing on a partnership strategy, where it provides recipe search and/or shopping list capabilities for partners like Martha Stewart, The Daily Meal, and Ming Tsai.ZipList will continue to operate as an independent company and serve its existing customers, Condé Nast says.Our goal is to build ZipList as an independent company while collaborating with our food brands to integrate its core technology, and to create partnerships that allow other companies to do the same,” Condé Nast president Bob Sauerberg says in the press release.The startup has raised $4.5 million from SoftBank, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, and others.
