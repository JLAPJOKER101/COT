An appeals court confirmed the conviction and death sentence on Monday for the only surviving gunman from the 2008 attacks on Mumbai, which killed 166 people and derailed peace talks with neighboring Pakistan. The High Court rejected an appeal by the man, Ajmal Kasab, 22, a Pakistani who was convicted of charges including murder, waging war against India, conspiracy and terrorism. He could still appeal to the Supreme Court.
