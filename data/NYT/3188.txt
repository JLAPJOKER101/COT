The mother and grandfather of a 4-year-old girl whose body was found in a suitcase at the bottom of a Tel Aviv river were sentenced Monday to life in prison for the murder that shocked Israel. Ronny Ron, the girl&rsquo;s grandfather, and Marie Pisam, her mother, who are a couple, won a French court order for the girl to live with them in Israel instead of with her father in France. Investigators said the girl, Rose Pisam, had severe behavioral problems. A court found that Mr. Ron and Ms. Pisam plotted to kill Rose and that Mr. Ron did so, dismembering her body and dumping it in a suitcase in the Yarkon River.
