A stampede killed at least 16 Hindu pilgrims and injured about 50 during a religious ceremony Tuesday on the banks of the Ganges River in northern India, a government spokesman said. The stampede, in Haridwar, a temple-filled town in Uttarakhand State, was set off when some of the thousands of pilgrims tripped while those behind continued to push forward, the spokesman said. Hundreds of thousands of Hindus visit Haridwar every year to bathe in the Ganges, believing it will cleanse them of sins and free them from the cycle of life and rebirth.
