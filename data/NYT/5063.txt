Democracy activists tested the government&rsquo;s promise to tolerate dissent by gathering peacefully on Monday at a central landmark in Yangon. Four truckloads of riot police officers and two prison vans hovered nearby, but the police did not interfere as about 60 activists held a prayer vigil at the Sule pagoda. Officers, however, did harass or stop marchers in other parts of the city. The protesters called for freeing political prisoners and stopping construction of a dam.
