Chile&rsquo;s conservative president, Sebasti&aacute;n Pi&ntilde;era, is proposing a law that would give unmarried partners many rights now enjoyed only by married couples. The more conservative leaders of his center-right coalition refused his invitation to the announcement ceremony in protest. Mr. Pi&ntilde;era said that marriage in conservative Chile will remain exclusive to heterosexual couples.
