A 22-year-old navy submarine crewman appeared in magistrate&rsquo;s court in Southampton on Monday, charged with killing one of the vessel&rsquo;s senior officers and wounding three crewmen in a burst of automatic rifle fire while the submarine was berthed in the city&rsquo;s harbor last week. The suspect, Able Seaman Ryan Donovan, was not asked to enter a plea and will return to court on Wednesday. A police investigation has focused on the gunman&rsquo;s motives, which British newspapers have reported as related to his having been denied use of a crew toilet and a request for shore leave. A navy inquiry is centering on how the seaman was cleared for high-security duty on the missile-carrying submarine despite postings on the Internet that revealed that he had legally changed his name to Reggie Moondogg before joining the navy and had written aggressive rap songs.
