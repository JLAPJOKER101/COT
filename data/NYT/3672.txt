A Dutch court of appeal has sentenced a Rwandan refugee to life in prison for his role during Rwanda&rsquo;s 1994 genocide. The refugee, Joseph Mpambara, 43, an ethnic Hutu businessman, led an attack on an Adventist compound in Muganero where Tutsi families had sought shelter, and hundreds were killed during the resulting bloodbath, the court said. He also was involved in holding up an ambulance that was carrying two Tutsi women and their children who were hacked to death with machetes, the three judges found.
