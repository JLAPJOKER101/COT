A member of Parliament pleaded guilty on Tuesday to dishonestly claiming about $22,000 in expense payments. The Parliament member, Eric Illsley, who has served since 1987 and became the first sitting member convicted in the expense account scandal, is to be sentenced next month. Mr. Illsley, 55, was re-elected in May from a district in northern England but was later suspended by the Labour Party. He was accused of dishonestly claiming expense payments for insurance, repairs, utility bills and taxes on a home in London from 2005 to 2008. Last week, a former lawmaker convicted of expense fraud, David Chaytor, was sentenced to 18 months in prison. Two other former legislators and two members of the House of Lords are scheduled to face trial in the coming months on charges related to their expense claims.
