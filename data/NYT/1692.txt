PARIS (Reuters) &mdash; The opposition Socialist Party decisively won French local elections on Sunday, and the far-right National Front surged, putting pressure on President Nicolas Sarkozy from two sides a year before he faces the electorate.        

With most votes counted in the second round of polls to elect cantonal councils in half of France, the left had 36 percent, almost double the ruling party&rsquo;s 18.6 percent.        

The anti-immigrant National Front, which has surged in opinion polls under its new leader, Marine Le Pen, scored 11 percent even though it put up candidates in only a minority of departments. In some areas it scored as much as 40 percent.        

The polls will probably be the last big test of sentiment before the April 2012 election.        

Ms. Le Pen has pushed ahead of the president to stand second behind leftists in opinion polls.        

Prime Minister Fran&ccedil;ois Fillon said the outcome for the National Front &ldquo;shows that the protest vote should not be underestimated or made light of. This party must be beaten, and the reasons for its support must be clearly evaluated and dealt with.&rdquo;        

Mr. Sarkozy&rsquo;s party, the U.M.P., has blurred the distinction with the far right by taking a tough line on the integration of the Muslim minority.        

Ms. Le Pen told reporters, &ldquo;A few more pushes and shoves with the battering ram and the U.M.P. system will disintegrate.&rdquo;        

But the president&rsquo;s popularity ratings have sunk to below 30 percent in the wake of his policies to rein in France&rsquo;s debt and amid criticism of his leadership style.        

France&rsquo;s cantonal councils take care of matters like the building of roads and schools as well as the distribution of various welfare subsidies.
