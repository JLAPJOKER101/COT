After complaints by Israeli officials and American Jewish groups, Facebook took down a page Tuesday by Palestinian supporters that called for violence against Jews and an uprising against Israel. The page, titled &ldquo;Third Palestinian Intifada,&rdquo; began this month as a call for peaceful protests in the occupied Palestinian territories, one of more than a dozen Facebook pages used recently to mobilize uprisings across the Middle East and North Africa. The unidentified advocates who managed the page initially removed comments that promoted violence, according to Facebook officials. But as the page grew to 340,000 members as of Monday, Facebook officials said the comments had deteriorated into direct calls for violence against Israel and Jews.
