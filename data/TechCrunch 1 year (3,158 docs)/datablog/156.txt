Well, I guess Im about to be shot down here. For a while Ive been contemplating a post about all the annual events in Europe which are specifically relevant to tech startups. Now when I say that, I do not mean hacker meetups in bars, or monthly events in various European cities. I mean Annual conferences and events where you will find startups, tech entrepreneurs and investors either milling about at a big general event on innovation (like DLD) or pitching on stage at a conference like Le Web. You will notice there are no URLs yet. When I get time I will add them (you can always use Google). For now I just wanted to get this post out there for you to look at and kick the tyres on.Yes, I know I have missed out the many, many monthly or quarterly meetups around Europe in various cities. That is not the point. The point is to surface the best annual events. I have been to many of them, so in some ways this is a personal list, in other ways Ive tried to highlight others I have not attended but which Ive heard are good. In addition, the majority  if not all  of these events are for an international audience so are held in English. I have tried not to included annual events which are only tailored to a single country and held in a local language.You will also notice I have not put in dates. Thats what your favourite search engine is for, so use it. What I wanted to achieve here was to show the travelling circus of tech startups events as they appear roughly week-by-week in Europe, thus Week 1, Week 2 etc. This could also help event planners. Clearly not all these events overlap and in some months there is more like 5 weeks than 4. If I have gotten anything really badly wrong then leave a comment below and I will adjust the listing. Also, I have included significant US events which European startups may want to attend. I have not included events in Asia, for which I apologise. This is more about US/European event traffic. I have also not included developer events in general  ones that are included are where engineers, product people, designers & CTOs can be found.Yes, some have notes attached, like Recommended, or Interesting. To be honest, ALL of them are interesting, but some are more off the beaten track than others and deserve a mention. To all my friends who run conferences that dont get a mention, I apologise  you are all great. Feel free to remind me about yours in the comments if Ive missed anyone.I hope everyone finds this useful. I will try to keep maintaining this post so that it remains up to date.
