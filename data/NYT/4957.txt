Seven Italian seismologists and scientists went on trial on manslaughter charges on Tuesday, accused of not adequately warning residents of a central Italian region before an earthquake that killed 309 people in April 2009. Prosecutors say that the seven defendants, members of a national panel that assesses major risks, played down the risk of a major earthquake&rsquo;s occurring even though there had been significant seismic activity near L&rsquo;Aquila, the capital of the Abruzzo region, in the months before the quake. The case has drawn the attention of the international scientific community, which argues that it is impossible to predict an earthquake. Prosecutors, in actuality, charge that the panel did not fulfill its mandate and instead conveyed &ldquo;incomplete, imprecise and contradictory information.&rdquo;
