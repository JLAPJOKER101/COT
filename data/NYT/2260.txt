ISLAMABAD, Pakistan &mdash; At least four people were killed in the southern port city of Karachi on Tuesday in bombings that struck two buses carrying Pakistani naval employees, a senior naval official said. At least 56 people were wounded.        

The official, Commodore Irfan ul-Haq, identified the dead as a civilian doctor, a junior naval officer, and two low-ranking naval employees.        

No one claimed responsibility immediately, but Taliban insurgents and militant groups affiliated with the organization have repeatedly attacked civilians and military installations across the country. Karachi is the country&rsquo;s largest city and considered the financial and commercial capital.        

Both bombs struck during the early morning rush. The first was planted on a motorcycle that was idling by a main road in an upscale neighborhood, the police said; it exploded as the naval bus passed. The blast destroyed the bus, killing the junior naval officer and the doctor and wounding 37 other passengers. The windows of nearby houses were shattered.        

Minutes later, in a relatively impoverished neighborhood, a remote-controlled bomb hidden in roadside rubble exploded, the police said. That blast killed the two other naval employees and injured 19 others.        

On Saturday, Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, the army chief, claimed to in a speech before Afghan military cadets to have broken the back of militants in the country.        

The bombings were &ldquo;a powerful message by the militants,&rdquo; said Omar R. Quraishi, opinion pages editor of The Express Tribune, an English-language daily newspaper based in Karachi. &ldquo;The message is that we may be on the run, but we can strike at will and choose targets of our choosing.&rdquo;
