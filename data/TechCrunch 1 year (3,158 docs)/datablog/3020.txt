Music search and discovery company SoundHound has inked a deal with digital music service provider Spotify to enable SoundHound users in Europe to instantly access the latters catalogue (of over 15 million tracks). From the sound of it, the partnership doesnt enable users outside of Europe to cross that particular bridge just yet.Starting today, SoundHound users on iOS and Android devices who also subscribe to Spotify Premium will be given the option to ‘Play Now in Spotify’ after identifying a song through the  music discovery and recognition service. That goes for users of both the free and the paid SoundHound apps.SoundHound users in Europe who dont subscribe to Spotify Premium will be redirected to a page inviting them to become Spotify users before proceeding to listen to the track. A direct Shazam (Encore) competitor, SoundHounds Sound2Sound technology searches sound against sound, thus bypassing traditional sound-to-text conversion techniques. Headquartered in San Jose, California, SoundHound is backed by Global Catalyst Partners, TransLink Capital, Walden Venture Capital, and other Silicon Valley investors.
