Prime Minister Bruce Golding announced Tuesday that Jamaica&rsquo;s education minister, Andrew Holness, 39, had received the unanimous endorsement of lawmakers from the governing party to become the Caribbean island&rsquo;s next leader. Mr. Golding&rsquo;s move appeared intended to salvage the party&rsquo;s chances in the next general election, which must be held by December 2012. Mr. Golding has suffered from anemic public backing because of his handling of the 2009 United States extradition request for the Jamaican drug kingpin Christopher Coke. The prime minister authorized an American firm to lobby Washington to drop the request, provoking an outcry that hobbled his political career.
