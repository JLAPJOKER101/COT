Pro-government forces have carried out 26 extrajudicial killings in the past month, the United Nations peacekeeping mission said Thursday. The mission also documented 85 illegal arrests and 11 rapes by those forces, mainly former rebels who helped President Alassane Ouattara defeat the former president Laurent Gbagbo, who had refused to cede power after losing an election. The abuses were reported to have been committed between July 11 and Aug. 10, long after the conflict was supposed to have ended.
