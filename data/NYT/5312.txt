Iran&rsquo;s top prosecutor reported 14 new arrests on Monday in connection with a record $2.6 billion embezzlement uncovered last month at Bank Melli, the largest commercial bank in the country, and called on its fugitive managing director to return home from Canada, where he fled as the fraud was about to become public. The new arrests, coming atop 22 arrests already reported, were announced by Gholam Hossein Mohseni Ejei, the national prosecutor general, at a news conference in Tehran. He did not identify any of the suspects but according to Iranian state media accounts of the announcement, they include a number of bank managers.
