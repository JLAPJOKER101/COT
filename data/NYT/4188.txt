Australia&rsquo;s highest court on Monday extended an injunction stopping the deportation of asylum seekers to Malaysia, delaying a controversial refugee-swap deal between the two countries. Lawyers representing a group of boat people who were to have been deported on Monday argued in the High Court that the government did not have the legal power to send them to Malaysia. Judge Kenneth Hayne ruled that there was &ldquo;a sufficiently serious question&rdquo; to be referred to the full court.
