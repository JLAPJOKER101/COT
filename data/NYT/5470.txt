Japan&rsquo;s prime minister will return looted Korean royal documents during a summit meeting with his South Korean counterpart this week, officials said Tuesday. The move is apparently an effort to bolster relations between the Asian neighbors. Japan colonized the Korean Peninsula from 1910 to 1945, and many older Koreans still harbor deep resentment over its rule. Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda&rsquo;s visit comes two months after South Korea barred three Japanese lawmakers from entering the country after they arrived at a Seoul airport with a plan to travel near islets at the center of territorial and historical disputes between the countries. Earlier, Tokyo&rsquo;s defense report claimed for the seventh straight year that the islets belong to Japan, drawing protests from Seoul.
