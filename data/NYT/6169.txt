CAIRO &mdash; Tethering Cairo&rsquo;s toiling and privileged, its Islamists and less pious, its worldly and street-smart, July 26th Street was named for the era of a long-ago revolution. Another one played out Monday along this rollicking thoroughfare, where Egypt&rsquo;s divides were bridged, for a moment, by the simplest of ideas: a chance at self-determination.        

Too often, elections have exacerbated differences rather than settled them. They sometimes seem more facade than agent of change, and Egypt remains under the boot of a military that seems convinced of its righteousness. But in a chaotic day &mdash; though not really all that much more turbulent than any other day here &mdash; a part of Egypt shrugged off a dictator&rsquo;s whims, assassins&rsquo; bullets and fears of foreigners&rsquo; hands to contest the country&rsquo;s future in an election that finally, for once, felt as if it meant something.        

&ldquo;The beginning,&rdquo; read the headline of a newspaper for sale on the street.        

No one knows what the revolution in the Arab world&rsquo;s largest and once most important country will bring &mdash; a state dominated by Islamists perhaps, or a country mired in misery, disappointment or simmering unrest. But the divisions along July 26th Street were wrestled with in a vote whose symbolism may prove most lasting.        

By morning in the neighborhood of Boulaq, at a polling station along one of July 26th Street&rsquo;s grittier locales and around the corner from tethered donkeys, Ahmed Hassan celebrated the moment, as standing water from rainfall the night before shimmered under a pale sun.        

&ldquo;Freedom is a blessing, and there&rsquo;s no equivalent to it,&rdquo; Mr. Hassan said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s more important than food and water. When you eat in humiliation, you can&rsquo;t taste the food.&rdquo;        

The name Boulaq is said to be taken from the French for Good Lake, but there is nothing rustic about it. In the shadow of the Foreign Ministry, rendered in the neo-Pharaonic design to which Egypt&rsquo;s authoritarian leaders were partial, it is a m&eacute;lange of faded colonial architecture and the concrete of urban alienation, interspersed with markets for secondhand clothes. The San Francisco Photo Studio neighbors the People&rsquo;s Hospital for Sick Animals, a ways down from a scrawled slogan: &ldquo;Boulaq is Cairo&rsquo;s beating heart.&rdquo;        

The symbols of candidates and parties abounded &mdash; a cannon, a tractor, a motorcycle &mdash; all but the crescent and the camel that belonged to the ruling party of President Hosni Mubarak, who ruled for nearly 30 years until he was toppled in February.        

&ldquo;Are they Islamists?&rdquo; an elderly woman asked Ahmed Mahmoud, who passed out leaflets for candidates of the religious Muslim Brotherhood at the polling station there.        

&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never regret,&rdquo; he assured her.        

&ldquo;How could we regret?&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re doing this for God.&rdquo;        

Elections in Iraq in 2005 helped ignite a civil war there, sharpening a sectarian divide. From Morocco to Syria, the tumult in the region has already empowered Islamists over the most visceral of fears of their opponents. But along the street in Boulaq, what was often heard from uncomprehending voters, some asking neighbors at the polling stations whom they should vote for, was not fervor for an Islamist state or devotion to religious law, but rather a sense that other ideologies had failed.        

&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s give them a try,&rdquo; said Zeinahom Abdel-Aziz, a 55-year-old woman who voted for Mr. Mubarak&rsquo;s ruling party last year and in the previous four elections, all shams to varying degrees. &ldquo;If they don&rsquo;t provide us services, then we&rsquo;ll throw them out.&rdquo;        

At a polling station where all cast their voices as a shout, Akram Hanafi explained his vote. He smoked, did not pray regularly, preferred hashish grown in Lebanon and called himself devout only inside his home. But he was voting for Salafists, who have the most conservative of all Islamist parties, because he said he had had enough of the opportunism, the corruption, the police and the undelivered promises that marked his 31 years of life.        

&ldquo;Their principles never change,&rdquo; he said, holding his son, Yusuf, who was born on Jan. 25, the date Egypt&rsquo;s revolt began. (He learned of the boy&rsquo;s birth while engaged in a melee with the police on that day.) &ldquo;They have a harmony in faith and how they will work.&rdquo;

Clashes last week between the police and protesters killed 43 and wounded thousands near the landmark Tahrir Square. One participant called the unrest a &ldquo;Revolution of the Hungry,&rdquo; and that frustration was pronounced down the street. At the Freedom Cafe, pensioners lamented the $40 a month they are supposed to live on. On a curb, youths complained of bribes, traffic, housing, rent and bad bread. The anger continued all the way to the May 15th Bridge, which spans the Nile. A modest skyline of luxury hotels catering to foreigners framed the river. Leaflets for the Nour Party, among the most ardent of Islamists, blew toward Zamalek, the wealthy neighborhood on the other side.        

&ldquo;We are not here to serve the rulers,&rdquo; said Alice Tcherasson, a 49-year-old principal standing in a line that stretched for blocks down July 26th street, past locales like Maison Thomas, Drinkies and a shop selling Rolex watches. &ldquo;It was always that way. It&rsquo;s never been the other way around, and that&rsquo;s what we want to change.&rdquo;        

Zamalek&rsquo;s residents never turned out much for elections in the past, and the dearth of infrastructure for voting meant some people waited there six hours to vote. Residents played with their BlackBerrys, had coffee delivered from Cilantro or chatted about the actresses in their midst &mdash; Youssra, in a black ski cap, the most famous among them. Sentiments ran liberal and secular, mainly for a coalition called the Egyptian Bloc.        

&ldquo;In Iran, the revolution was for democracy and freedom, and the result was different,&rdquo; said Simone Haddad, who had brought a chair with her, helping ease a two-hour wait. &ldquo;We all hope the result here will not be the same. We&rsquo;re all worried.&rdquo;        

They spoke darkly about Islamists and about the illiterate across the river.        

&ldquo;If they cannot have anything good in this life, then those parties promise them something in the afterlife,&rdquo; said Ramez Youssef, who was standing nearby.        

But along the street, named for the era when a monarchy fell in 1952 and a revolution was declared, the feelings were not dejection, or surrender, or a shrug of the shoulders. They were articulated with a hint of optimism that contrasted with what Malak Badrawi, a teacher who called herself old, said was &ldquo;so much rubbish for 60 years.&rdquo;        

Tough talking, with short cropped hair, Ms. Badrawi called the day &ldquo;imagination and action,&rdquo; the chance to re-create a country that her generation never managed to change.        

&ldquo;We were scared out of our wits,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;This generation is much more idealistic than we were. They&rsquo;re much less cynical than we are. They have endurance, and they&rsquo;ll go on, despite all the odds. They&rsquo;re willing to fight, and we weren&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
