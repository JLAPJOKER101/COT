Investigators have found that tainted milk that killed three children in northwest China appeared to be a case of intentional poisoning, and they have detained a suspect, state media said Monday. Investigators found that nitrite, an industrial salt, was added to fresh milk from two dairies last week in Gansu Province, the China Daily newspaper reported. In a separate report, the newspaper said that authorities in Henan Province had detained 95 people in a scandal over tainted pork. The detainees were accused of making, selling or using pig feed laced with clenbuterol, a banned additive.
