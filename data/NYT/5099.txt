Security forces on Tuesday raided the home of the lawyer who had represented the American hikers who were released last week, and they briefly detained him at Evin Prison in Tehran, where the hikers were held for 781 days. &ldquo;It was strange to see an arrest warrant issued for me, as arrest warrants are usually issued for murderers or fugitives,&rdquo; the lawyer, Masoud Shafiei, told the International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran a few hours after his release. Mr. Shafiei said the officers took his passport and a computer and documents from his office before returning them. Much of his interrogation, he added, concerned the two Americans, Joshua F. Fattal and Shane M. Bauer, who were sharply critical of the Iranian government after their release.
