The government said Friday that it would pay a reward of $100,000 for the capture of a former Mai Mai militia leader who escaped from jail in Lubumbashi along with hundreds of other prisoners. The militia leader, Kyungu Mutanga, was sentenced to death for war crimes and crimes against humanity. He had been in prison for five years before he and nearly 970 others escaped on Wednesday. Two people were killed in the jailbreak, and only 152 prisoners have been recaptured.
