The police detained at least 130 protesters at New Year&rsquo;s Eve rallies in Moscow and St. Petersburg against restrictions on freedom of assembly and a court decision to keep Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, the Russian tycoon who was imprisoned in 2003 for defying the Kremlin, in prison. A number of opposition leaders, heading a protest of hundreds in freezing weather in central Moscow, were among 70 people detained in the capital, an opposition Web site and nonstate media said. Activists, some wearing masks of Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin&rsquo;s face and holding posters reading &ldquo;Putin is a bloodsucking insect,&rdquo; protested Thursday&rsquo;s decision by a Moscow judge to keep Mr. Khodorkovsky in jail for six more years. Mr. Khodorkovsky, the former chief of the Yukos oil group, was convicted of theft and money-laundering in his second trial, which was condemned in the West as politically motivated.
