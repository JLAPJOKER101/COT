Four men arrested on suspicion of plotting a terrorist attack in Goteborg, Sweden&rsquo;s second-largest city, were identified in court documents on Monday as local residents in their twenties who were originally from Somalia and Iraq. The police arrested the men &mdash; three of whom are Swedish citizens &mdash; in a sting on the eve of the 10th anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks. About 400 people were evacuated from an arts center in connection with the arrests, but the police have not said whether the building was the target of the suspected plot.
