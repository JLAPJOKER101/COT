A cholera outbreak that has already killed 32 people in Congo has spread to the capital, Kinshasa, the World Health Organization said Wednesday. Three cases of cholera, a waterborne disease, have been confirmed since last week in Kinshasa, which has a population of at least nine million people, many of whom live in cramped, unsanitary conditions. Eugene Kabambi, communications officer for WHO, said traders traveling by boat down the Congo River were bringing the disease from an area where an outbreak infected more than 680 people and killed 32 this month.
