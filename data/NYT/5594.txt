An unidentified gunman wounded the chief justice of the high court in the Pakistani-controlled part of the disputed Kashmir region on Tuesday, the police said. The justice, Ghulam Mustafa Mughal, was shot in the abdomen and taken to a military hospital, where his condition was said to be stable. The gunman was not caught, and the motive for the attack was unclear. Kashmir is claimed by both India and Pakistan, and the attack occurred after death threats were made to another Pakistani judge, who had sentenced the killer of the Punjab Province governor.
