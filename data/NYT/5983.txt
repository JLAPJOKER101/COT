LONDON &mdash; A lawyer representing 51 people who say they were victims of phone hacking and press intrusion told a hearing on Wednesday that his clients and their families had been followed, spied on, threatened, harassed, vilified, blackmailed and driven to suicide attempts by a British tabloid run amok.        

Testifying before the Leveson Inquiry, called to examine press ethics in the wake of the phone hacking scandal that shook the British news media and political establishment last summer, the lawyer, David Sherborne, described some of the particulars.        

He told of the actor Hugh Grant&rsquo;s former girlfriend, while pregnant with the couple&rsquo;s child, receiving &ldquo;a barrage of telephone calls&rdquo; from a blocked number one evening just as Mr. Grant was speaking out against the tabloid press on a BBC program. &ldquo;When she finally answered,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;she was threatened in the most menacing terms&rdquo; and ordered to tell Mr. Grant to &ldquo;shut up.&rdquo;        

He also described how the parents of Milly Dowler, a teenager who was murdered in 2002, felt &ldquo;euphoria&rdquo; when they discovered that voice mail messages had been deleted from her cellphone after she went missing, leading them to think it meant that she was still alive. The parents later learned that The News of the World had hacked into her phone and deleted the messages to make room for more messages from her distraught friends and family, so they could then listen to those, too.        

Rupert Murdoch&rsquo;s News Corporation, which owned The News of the World and shut it down in July, recently paid the Dowler family $3.2 million in compensation.        

The disclosure that Milly&rsquo;s phone had been hacked, first made by The Guardian in July, caused widespread revulsion in Britain. The matter escalated into a full-blown scandal, and more than a dozen former News of the World employees have been arrested so far on suspicion of phone hacking and paying police officers for information.        

Many of Mr. Sherborne&rsquo;s clients, including several members of Parliament and the writer J. K. Rowling, are due to testify before the panel next week, and Mr. Sherborne laid out some of their grievances in advance.        

He mentioned Max Mosley, a former motor racing executive who was the subject of a News of the World article that accused him of having taken part in a Nazi-themed sex session with several prostitutes (he admitted to the sex session, but not to the Nazi theme; he won a court case proving the paper wrong).        

The story &mdash; which had been sold to the newspaper by one of the prostitutes, who was instructed (unsuccessfully) by an editor to lure Mr. Mosley into giving a &ldquo;Sieg Heil&rdquo; salute that could then be photographed &mdash; so distressed his family that it was a factor in his son&rsquo;s subsequent suicide, Mr. Sherborne said. A journalist posing as a passer-by then tried to crash Mr. Mosley&rsquo;s son&rsquo;s funeral and photograph the guests.        

The lawyer also cited a celebrity singer, Charlotte Church, saying that The News of the World had reported that she was pregnant, before she told her parents.        

The paper also published an article exposing Ms. Church&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s extramarital affair, Mr. Sherborne said &mdash; whereupon Ms. Church&rsquo;s mother tried to kill herself.        

&ldquo;In an act of &lsquo;sensitivity,&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; he added, the newspaper then told the mother, who had been hospitalized, that if she gave them an exclusive interview, &ldquo;they would not run another lurid story about her husband&rsquo;s affair.&rdquo;        

Another of Mr. Sherborne&rsquo;s clients, the soccer player Garry Flitcroft, was exposed for having cheated on his wife. The subsequent treatment of Mr. Flitcroft&rsquo;s parents and children &mdash; followed by reporters and photographers on foot, in cars and in helicopters &mdash; proved so upsetting that it contributed to Mr. Flitcroft&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s suicide, Mr. Sherborne said.
