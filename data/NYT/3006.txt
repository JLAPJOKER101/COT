The notorious sign that once spanned the main gate at Auschwitz will not return to its original spot after being repaired from the damage it suffered during a 2009 theft, an international council that oversees Auschwitz-Birkenau decided Thursday. The sign bearing the slogan &ldquo;Arbeit Macht Frei,&rdquo; or Work Sets You Free, will instead be housed in a planned exhibition hall, said Pawel Sawicki, a spokesman for the memorial site. Experts said the sign would be better preserved indoors. A replica of the sign now hangs in its place at the gate to the former Nazi death camp.
