The Dalai Lama said Monday that a recent wave of self-immolations in southwestern China was born of desperation because Tibetans faced &ldquo;cultural genocide&rdquo; under Chinese rule. &ldquo;Some kind of policy, some kind of cultural genocide is taking place,&rdquo; the Dalai Lama, above, the Tibetan spiritual leader, told journalists in Tokyo. Citing hard-line policies in China over the last 10 to 15 years, he added, &ldquo;so that&rsquo;s why you see these sad incidents have happened due to this desperate sort of situation.&rdquo; Eleven Tibetans have set themselves on fire to protest Chinese rule since March. At least five monks and two nuns have died.
