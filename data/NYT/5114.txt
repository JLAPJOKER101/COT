The Ministry of Culture has canceled a prize that a group of Chinese had come up with as an alternative to the Nobel Peace Prize, which was given to an imprisoned dissident, Liu Xiaobo, last year. The organizers of the Chinese version of the Nobel, the Confucius Prize, had intended to give it in December to one of eight nominees, among them Vladimir V. Putin, the Russian prime minister, and a young Tibetan man whom the Communist Party had appointed to be the Panchen Lama. But the Culture Ministry said the group, called the Traditional Culture Protection Department of the Association of Chinese Indigenous Arts, was in violation of ministry rules and had to disband. Last year, the Confucius Prize was given to Lien Chan, a Taiwanese politician who had supported greater ties between China and Taiwan. He learned of the award only when journalists called him.
