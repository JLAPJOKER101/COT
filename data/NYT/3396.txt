A senior American diplomat said Thursday that either side that emerged from Yemen&rsquo;s four-month political crisis to run the country would cooperate with Washington in battling Al Qaeda&rsquo;s Yemen branch. Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs Jeffrey D. Feltman said after talks with government officials and opposition figures in Sana that both sides understood Washington&rsquo;s concerns. &ldquo;Everyone gave us some assurances that they are concerned about Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Any government is going to be a strong partner. They are committed to work with us in fighting terrorism.&rdquo;
