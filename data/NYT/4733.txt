A radio talk show host who had been a prominent government critic was killed by gunmen in his home on Thursday, a security official said. The host, Hadi al-Mahdi, had organized protests, including one planned for Friday,&nbsp; to call for more government accountability and better services. In a posting on Facebook just three hours before he was killed, he said that he had received threatening messages from people trying to deter him from holding the protest. He said the demonstration would go on. &ldquo;I firmly believe the political process is a trash can of economic and political failure and we deserve to have it changed and we deserve a better government,&rdquo; he wrote.
