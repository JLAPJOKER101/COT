The government said Monday that after a year of studying the remains of the 19th-century independence hero S&iacute;mon Bol&iacute;var, experts have been unable to pin down the cause of his death. The government of President Hugo Ch&aacute;vez, who regularly extols Bol&iacute;var as his inspiration, exhumed his remains a year ago for clues about his death. &ldquo;We couldn&rsquo;t establish that the death had been due to nonnatural causes or intentional poisoning,&rdquo; Vice President Elias Jaua said. He said the investigation would continue. Historians have said that Bol&iacute;var died of tuberculosis in 1830, but Mr. Ch&aacute;vez reiterated Monday that he suspected foul play.
