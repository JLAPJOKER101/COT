PARIS &mdash; The French police have stopped 46 women seen wearing facial veils in public since a ban on such coverings went into effect last month, the Interior Ministry said Wednesday.        

Of those women, 27 have been charged and will be fined about $215 or forced to take an official course on citizenship.        

The interventions have proceeded &ldquo;without any problems,&rdquo; Interior Minister Claude Gu&eacute;ant said last week on French radio. Mr. Gu&eacute;ant said officers had recently stopped an American woman, who resides near Paris, as she arrived from Saudi Arabia at Charles de Gaulle Airport.        

France became the first country in Europe to ban the wearing of the facial veil in public, including in shops and on the street.        

Before the ban took effect, many police officers feared the law would prove difficult to enforce and could provoke unrest in cities with large Muslim communities.        

The law has led to small protests in Paris and several other cities. On April 21, about 40 Muslims prayed in front of a police station in Toulouse, in southwestern France, after the police there stopped a woman who was wearing a veil.        

One-half of women in France who wear the veil have removed it in public since the law went into effect, according to Rachid Nekkaz, a property dealer who leads an association contesting the ban. Mr. Nekkaz has promised to pay the fines incurred by veil-wearing women.        

Before the ban, the Interior Ministry estimated that about 2,000 women wore facial veils in France.
