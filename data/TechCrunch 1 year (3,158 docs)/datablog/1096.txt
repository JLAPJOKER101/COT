John and I believe firmly in this, and have thus decided to venture forth and find technology gems hidden away in cities with less prominent tech scenes.The first of these adventures takes place in Washington DC, and as I type these very words Im surrounded with at least 300 entrepreneurs, startup employees, investors, and journalists.
