Interview Street, the startup that helps companies recruit by holding programming contests called CodeSprints, is doing something a little different this week â€” its holding a CodeSprint for 13 different startups, all backed by Sequoia Capital.The CodeSprints started out as big events with a long list of recruiting companies, but while there are still plans for more comprehensive CodeSprints in the future, Interview Street started holding smaller, more frequent events, usually tied to a specific company or technology. It even did a CodeSprint with the White House, and its working on a second.So why go with a single CodeSprint for a bunch of Sequoia companies? Co-founder Vivek Ravisankar says, They have funded some of the best tech startups. So instead of doing it individually for each startup, its a single gate. The participating employers include Inkling, Natera, BubbleMotion, EventBrite, TuneIn, Outright, PocketGems, Birst, Barracuda Networks, Tokbox, Sugar Inc., Backplane, and Synapsense.You can read more details about the Sequoia CodeSprint here. Its going to be held on Saturday, April 14, from 3pm to 8pm Pacific.
