A stampede of pilgrims returning from a popular Hindu festival killed more than 100 people and injured 25 others on Friday night, the local police said. The stampede was set off when a group of pilgrims in a jeep drove into a crowd of worshipers walking along a narrow forest path. An estimated 150,000 devotees were thought to have taken the path out of densely forested hills on their return from the remote Sabarimala shrine in Kerala State, in southern India, The Press Trust of India reported. The ceremony on Friday marked the end of the annual two-month festival.
