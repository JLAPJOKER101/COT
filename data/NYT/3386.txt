An international prosecutor said Thursday that he had sought approval of the International Criminal Court in The Hague to investigate reports of war crimes and crimes against humanity in the conflict after last November&rsquo;s presidential elections in Ivory Coast. President Alassane Ouattara has asked the court to intercede, even though the country is not a signatory to the court. The prosecutor, Luis Moreno-Ocampo, said his office had reason to believe that during the postelection violence at least 3,000 people were killed, more than 70 disappeared and more than 100 were raped.
