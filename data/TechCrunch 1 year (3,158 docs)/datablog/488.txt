The Black IPs lol. I follow nerds on Twitter, so rather than just the latest pop stars and sports games, I was delighted to see a nerdy hashtag in my Trending Topics. Its thanks to Twitters new Tailored Trends that launched on Tuesday and shows you personalized trends based on who you follow.Creedence ClearRecentHistory? Revival brilliant. In just a few days Tailored Trends has shown algorithms can beat back the stupidity of the Internet. Heres why this matters, and a look at the best of #FailedTechBands.The sad fact is that theres a bag full of idiots for every genius on Twitter. Worse yet, smart people respect those who follow them and dont flood their streams with a thousand repetitive tweets  dumb hashtags for example. Meanwhile, the imbeciles of the world post a flurry of tweets oblivious to it drowning out more sensible content.That meant intelligent hashtags and topics were less likely to reach the volume necessary to break into the Trending Topics list. As a result, Trends was often filled with inane, offensive, and downright stupid hashtags and phrases because of this difference in tweeting behavior. But now if I see idiotic trends, its my own damn fault for following idiots. Well done, Twitter.Well done because advertisers are probably a lot more willing to pay for a Promoted Trend now that its less likely to sit next to #BlameTheMuslims #BigDickProblems and other racist, sexist, childish, and otherwise offensive content Ive seen become Trends. Twitter should avoid censorship of actual tweets at all costs. But when it comes to repurposing content within the service, focusing on relevancy might incidentally keep things a little cleaner, smarter, more productive.So what did my delightful discovery of a truly relevant hashtag win me?
