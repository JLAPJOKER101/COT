Four young leaders of Iraq&rsquo;s struggling government-reform movement were released from jail after being held for 12 days without formal charges. At a news conference on Wednesday, a day after their release, the men said they had been interrogated by officers who asked questions about possible ties between the protest movement and Al Qaeda or the outlawed Baath Party. Ultimately, security officials accused the men of carrying fake identification cards &mdash; a charge all of them denied. It is unclear whether officials will attempt to formally prosecute them. Human rights activists have called the detentions an attempt to sap the strength of the youth-led reform movement.
