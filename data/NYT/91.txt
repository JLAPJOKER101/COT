Opposition lawmakers gained a bigger presence and a platform to challenge President Hugo Ch&aacute;vez as a new National Assembly took office on Wednesday. After having almost no representation at all in the last assembly because of a decision to boycott elections in 2005, the opposition now controls 67 of the assembly&rsquo;s 165 seats. But the departing assembly granted Mr. Ch&aacute;vez special decree powers for the next 18 months, meaning he will be able to bypass the National Assembly to enact many laws.
