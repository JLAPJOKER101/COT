WASHINGTON (AP) &mdash; The Central Intelligence Agency is allowing members of the House and Senate Intelligence and Armed Services Committees to see photographs of Osama bin Laden&rsquo;s corpse, a C.I.A. spokeswoman said Wednesday. Lawmakers will view the photos in a secure room at the agency&rsquo;s headquarters in Langley, Va., and cannot take copies of the photos with them.        

Senator James M. Inhofe, an Oklahoma Republican who is on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said he suggested that the C.I.A. director, Leon E. Panetta, make them available to the committees, and Mr. Panetta agreed.        

&ldquo;By viewing these photos, I can help dispel conspiracy theorists who doubt that Bin Laden is in fact dead,&rdquo; Senator Inhofe said in a statement.        

President Obama decided last week against releasing the photos publicly, concluding that the images could incite violence against Americans and would do little to persuade skeptics that the founder of Al Qaeda had been killed, White House officials have said.        

Senator Mark Udall, Democrat of Colorado and a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, plans to look over the photos. His spokeswoman, Tara Trujillo, said he believed it was &ldquo;due diligence&rdquo; to look.        

But Representative Mike Coffman, Republican of Colorado, who is on the Armed Services Committee, said: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have any fascination with looking at gunshot wounds to the face.&rdquo;
