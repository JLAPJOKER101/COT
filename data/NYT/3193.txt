A security guard was killed and three people were injured Monday afternoon when a suicide bomber detonated his explosives at a bank in Islamabad, police officials said. It was not clear why the bomber attacked a branch of a local bank, and there was no immediate claim of responsibility. The police speculated that the bomber might have been trying to create panic or mistakenly thought the bank was foreign owned.
