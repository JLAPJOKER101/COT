Federal prosecutors in New York announced murder charges on Tuesday against a Kosovar suspected of fatally shooting two United States airmen and wounding two others at the Frankfurt airport on March 2. The Kosovar, Arid Uka, 21, confessed to the attack, the German authorities said in March. He is currently detained in Germany. &ldquo;As Uka fired his gun, he repeated aloud an Arabic expression that means &lsquo;God is great&rsquo; and continued shooting until his gun did not fire,&rdquo; the United States attorney, Preet Bharara, said in a statement.
