The authorities in Indian-administered Kashmir said they killed a top officer of Lashkar-e-Taiba, a Pakistan-based militant group that was responsible for the 2008 attacks in Mumbai, in a gun battle on Tuesday. The officer, Azhar Malik, was shot after the police surrounded a house where he had been hiding in the town of Sopore, the district police chief, Imtiaj Hussain, said in a telephone interview. Mr. Malik was involved in at least 20 cases of terrorist activities, the police chief said, the latest being the bombing in April that killed a moderate separatist religious leader in the Kashmir Valley.
