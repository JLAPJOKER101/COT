The Democratic Republic of Congo on Friday arrested a senior army commander, Lt. Colonel Kibibi Mutwara, accused of ordering his men to rape more than a dozen women in eastern Congo this month, a United Nations spokesman said. The arrest follows the detention of 10 other soldiers in the case. Colonel Kibibi was arrested in the Fizi region of South Kivu Province, where soldiers are alleged to have carried out dozens of rapes on New Year&rsquo;s Day. Colonel Kibibi has denied he instructed his men to carry out the abuses.
