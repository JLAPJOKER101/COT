In a significant victory against the government that once evicted them from their ancestral lands, Botswana&rsquo;s Bushmen are drinking water from a borehole well in the Kalahari Desert for the first time in nine years, Survival International said Monday. The government capped the well at Mothomelo in 2002 in an attempt to force the tribe out of an area rich in diamonds. In 2006, a court ruled the eviction illegal. But few Bushmen returned because the only water available was in handmade sand depressions. Survival International, which works for tribal people&rsquo;s rights, said the Mothomelo well was redrilled and a solar pump installed by the Vox United charity working with Gem Diamonds, which mines in the Bushmen&rsquo;s lands.
