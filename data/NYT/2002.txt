A United Nations torture investigator in Geneva said Monday that he had been denied an unmonitored visit to an American Army private suspected of giving classified material to WikiLeaks. The investigator, Juan Mendez, said in a statement that the United States government &ldquo;has not been receptive to a confidential meeting&rdquo; with Pfc. Bradley Manning, above, who is being held in solitary confinement in Quantico, Va. Amnesty International has said his treatment, including being stripped naked each night and given a suicide-proof smock to wear, may violate his rights.
