A jury convicted three Brazilian doctors of killing four patients by removing their organs, which prosecutors said were used for transplants at an expensive private clinic. A judge in S&atilde;o Paulo State, Marco Montemor, sentenced the doctors to 17 years and 6 months each in prison. Two doctors were charged with murder after removing both kidneys from the patients and preparing the organs for transport, while a neurosurgeon was charged as an accomplice for incorrectly declaring the patients brain-dead and authorizing the harvest of their organs. The scheme was discovered in 1986. The defense lawyer, who said that the donors were already dead, said he would appeal.
