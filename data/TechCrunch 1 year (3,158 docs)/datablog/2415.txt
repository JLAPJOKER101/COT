Fresh off a $600K round of seed funding, developer education startup Treehouse is launching to the public this morning, using videos, quizzes and badges to take ostensibly anyone from n00b to 1337 in months.Unlike Codeacademy and Lynda, Treehouse offers a breadth of expert-curated web design, development and iOS development topics (HTML,CSS Foundations,Technology Foundations,Aesthetic Foundations,Introduction to Programming, and others) and is already profitable as it charges users from$29 to $49 dollars a month to use its programs.What also sets Treehouse apart from others in the space is that users win badges (see below) for getting five questions in a row correct on its quizzes or completing in-browser code challenges, with the objective of building out their public profiles athttp://teamtreehouse.com/yourprofile.
