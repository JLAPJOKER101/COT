Grab your salt shakers, friends. The always vocal trade publication, DigiTimes, is reporting that Apple is preparing for an October release of a Retina-equipped iMac following a spec bump this July. This conflicts with previous reports citing Apple executives saying redesigned iMacs would hit next year.Its entirely possible that Apple will stuff a Retina display within the current iMac, and then in turn, launch a redesigned model next year like previous reports suggest. As demonstrated by the MacBook Pro with Retina Displays price, the ultra high-resolution display is a costly component. Apple is likely holding out until LCD makers can increase their production yield, therefore dropping the price of the units. A Retina-equipped iMac is all but guaranteed; Apple just needs to make sure the model is priced right.A Retina iMac would have staggering display resolutions. A 21.5-inch model would likely have a resolution around 38402160, double that of the current 19201080 screen. The 27-inch already has a 25601440 display; a Retina-level screen might have a resolution around a staggering 51202880.Apple is seemingly trying to use the retina display to stand apart from other PC makers. It started with the iPhone and eventually hit the iPad. Now, with the latest MacBook Pro, Apple is charging forward with the Retina display. All thats missing is an iMac and Apple Display with a Retina display.
