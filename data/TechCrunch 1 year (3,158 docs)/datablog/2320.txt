And just when you thought things had finally settled down, everything  and I mean everything  is changing once again. Thats at least the view of Roger McNamee, the co-founder and Managing Partner of Elevation Partners, who believes that HTML5 is a sudden dramatic disruption that will fundamentally revolutionize the entire online consumer space. Riffing off Chris Andersons idea about the death of the web, McNamee thinks that in 3 or 4 years time, we will have HTML5 companies that will be creating consumer apps that none of us can even imagine today.I caught up with McNamee yesterday at the excellent Techonomy conference where he conducted a really memorable conversation with the great Lyle Lovett. And, as always, Roger didnt mince his words. Arguing that Android is a science project and reactionary, he suggested that the closed Apple model is what consumers prefer and that it is the iPhone app economy that has created the necessary conditions for the imminent HTLM5 revolution. Fighting words, indeed, from a guy who once rolled all his dice on Palm eating the iPhone for breakfast.This is the first interview of two I conducted with McNamee at Techonomy. The second, which Ill broadcast tomorrow, covers his views on Occupy Wall Street and is classic McNamee  both outrageously wise and wisely outrageous.
