Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan publicly apologized for the killings of thousands of Kurds in the southeast part of the country by the Turkish military from 1936 to 1939. &ldquo;If it is necessary to apologize on behalf of the state, I will apologize, and I am apologizing,&rdquo; Mr. Erdogan said in a televised speech during a party meeting in Ankara. The apology, however, followed the recent arrests of thousands of Kurdish activists, including academics, writers, lawyers and prominent social figures, on terror-related charges as part of the government&rsquo;s campaign against the Kurdish insurgency. Nearly 14,000 Kurds were killed in attacks by the army and air force in Dersim, which is now called Tunceli.
