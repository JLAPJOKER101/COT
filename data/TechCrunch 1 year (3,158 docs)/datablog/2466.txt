Memo to Chinese startups: You made for a late night of deliberations.  We typically pick five finalists. There were a few companies that were clear picks, captivating everyone from the judges to the staff to people we talked to in the hallways. Then there was another group that each had passionate advocates on staff, making for some tough decisions. Ultimately, the staff got down to six we liked and couldnt agree on which one to eliminate. So in the spirit of rule breaking, we decided to pick six finalists. Here they are in alphabetical order:Anquanbao
