The police in West Bengal said Thursday that they had killed a man they believe to be a top leader of the Maoist guerrillas menacing a broad swath of India. The leader, Mallojula Koteswara Rao, was better known as Kishenji and was a top member of the leftist insurgency&rsquo;s politburo. If his killing is confirmed, it will be a major victory for Indian officials, who have been struggling to end the armed struggle in some of the poorest regions of central India. Kishenji often acted as a spokesman for the rebels, giving interviews with his face obscured.
