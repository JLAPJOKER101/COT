France is ready to extradite the former Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega to his home country after the United States gave its consent, the French government said Monday. Panama has requested Mr. Noriega&rsquo;s extradition for his role in killing the leader of a 1989 coup attempt. Mr. Noriega was imprisoned in the United States for two decades after being deposed in a 1989 American invasion. He was sent from Florida to France last year to face money laundering charges and was sentenced to seven years in prison there.
