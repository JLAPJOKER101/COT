HouseTrip, the holiday lettings marketplace raised $2.7m from Index Ventures back in April and relaunched to appeal to a wider market than its holiday apartments rental space. HouseTrip built a reputation by removing the need for guests to negotiate with homeowners directly, thus building in a degree of security. Today its completed a $17 million Series B funding round led by Balderton Capital. Index Ventures reinvested pro-rata.  The funding will be used to develop the product, generate more inventory (through additional outreach to holiday apartment hosts) and reach (through marketing and localisation).
