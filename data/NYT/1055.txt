Al Qaeda&rsquo;s North African affiliate has released three hostages abducted in September from a French-run mine in Niger, the French presidency said Friday. Niger  authorities brought the three to Niamey, the capital, on Thursday, a security official said. The hostages, a Frenchwoman and men from Madagascar and Togo, and four Frenchmen were abducted from a uranium mine operated by the French nuclear giant Areva. It was not reported whether a ransom had been paid to Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, which claimed responsibility for the kidnappings. The other four hostages remain in captivity.
