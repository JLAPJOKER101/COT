An Egyptian youth coalition that played a major role in ousting President Hosni Mubarak has said it will field candidates for parliamentary elections to counter organized Islamist groups and remnants of the former government. The Revolution Youth Coalition, formed in the early days of the uprising, said on a social networking site that it planned to field as many as 200 candidates. A political analyst warned that the youth groups faced an uphill battle against the old guard and movements that may be better financed.
