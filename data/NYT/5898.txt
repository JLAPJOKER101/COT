A United Nations-backed court on Friday heard arguments on holding a trial in absentia for the four Hezbollah members who have been indicted in the killing of a former Lebanese prime minister, Rafik Hariri, in 2005. The prosecution of the Special Tribunal for Lebanon, near The Hague, argued that the Beirut government should do more to track down and hand over the men, or else present evidence to the court on why it cannot. The court issued arrest warrants for the men in June, but leaders of the powerful Hezbollah militia vowed that its members would never be found or detained. A prosecutor, Iain Morley, said it was too early to begin a trial without the defendants because &ldquo;a trial in absentia should be a last resort.&rdquo;
