While not launching the next Samsung flagship at MWC in Barcelona was probably the right choice for Samsung, that doesnt change the fact that were itching with anticipation over when the Galaxy S III will show its pretty little edge-to-edge face. We know most of the specs (well, rumored ones at least), which means we know well see a 4.8-inch Super AMOLED Plus display, a quad-core Samsung Exynos CPU running at 1.5GHz, and a little 4G LTE icon. What we dont know, however, is when well see any of this. But reports are now leaking out of Korea, citing Samsungs global marketing and advertising agency Cheil Worldwide, claiming that the phone we hate to wait for should show up in April. Things dont get any more specific than that unfortunately, but this still gives us plenty to work with. For one thing, we already knew that launch date rumors were circling around the March/April time frame. Secondly, Samsung itself confirmed that the phone would arrive before Summer, which leads us to believe that narrowing the launch period down to April seems correct. Weve also heard that the S III will launch simultaneously in over 50 major markets, rather than seeing an incremental roll-out like the S II. This means that whatever launch date is given will likely apply to us in the States, instead of Samsungs home team getting early access.
