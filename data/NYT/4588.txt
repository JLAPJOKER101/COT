What appears to be a human foot in a running shoe was found floating in a downtown inlet in Vancouver, British Columbia, on Tuesday. Eight feet have washed up on British Columbia&rsquo;s coastline, and another three have been found along the coast of Washington State since August 2007. Because people have planted animal feet as hoaxes since the cases began, the police said that testing would be needed to confirm that the foot is from a person. The police say the source of the feet seems to have no common factor, and government officials suggest the phenomenon may be partly a result of the particular geography of southern British Columbia, which has a sheltered coastline. Scientists say they believe that running shoes preserve tissue and provide floatation.
