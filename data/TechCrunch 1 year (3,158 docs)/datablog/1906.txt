Remember the mini-slate Samsung released a few months ago? The Samsung Galaxy Note? Pretty cool little device. As we enter CES week, the press releases are flying fast and furious and this one caught my eye. Its for a small company that makes accessories for gadgets and I suppose (I cant find the original) it outlined Anymodes plans for Samsung Note accessories. The release also noted that the Samsung Note would hit AT&T this year. There were rumors of this, but Anymode essentially confirmed it. Until they didnt.A few hours after the original announcement, I got an email retracting the earlier statement. It stated:JANUARY 6, 2012 The January 5, 2012 CES Media Alert titled Anymode Introduces First Accessories for Samsung Galaxy Note contained inaccurate information pertaining to AT&T and the release of the Samsung Galaxy Note.The information was not provided by Anymode, AT&T or Samsung , nor did Anymode, AT&T or Samsung approve it.  The issuing party apologizes for the publishing of the inaccurate information and any inconvenience it may have caused.
