More than 40 bodies have been found in a mass grave in Tamaulipas State in northern Mexico, near the site where drug gang members are believed to have killed 72 migrants last summer, the authorities said on Wednesday. The mass burial was discovered late Tuesday in the township of San Fernando, about 80 miles from the Texas border, in the area where 72 migrants, most from Central America, were found shot to death on Aug. 24. The authorities blamed that massacre on the Zetas drug gang, which is fighting its one-time allies in the Gulf cartel.
