The United Nations human rights body voted Thursday for the appointment of an investigator to monitor and report on Iran in response to its crackdown on political dissent. The Human Rights Council in Geneva voted 20 to 7, with 11 abstentions, in favor of the resolution co-sponsored by the United States and Sweden to appoint the investigator. Earlier, the council heard a report by the United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, in which he said Iran&rsquo;s leaders had intensified their crackdown on political opponents, activists and journalists and noted a &ldquo;dramatic surge&rdquo; in the number of executions since the start of 2011. The United States ambassador, Eileen Donahoe, hailed the vote as a &ldquo;seminal moment&rdquo; for the council. Iran condemned the resolution as an abuse of the council.
