The United Nations said Monday that it had started airlifting food aid to rebel-held parts of drought-hit Somalia and that Islamist insurgents had abided by a pledge to allow relief workers free access. The United Nations has described the drought as an emergency, and said some 10 million people were affected in the region near the borders of Kenya, Somalia and Ethiopia. The United Nations children&rsquo;s agency, Unicef, began airlifting food and medicine into the city of Baidoa over the weekend using an airstrip that the Shabab rebels had previously declared off limits.
