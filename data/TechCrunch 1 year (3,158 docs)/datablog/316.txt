I dont know too many people who would look at the Galaxy Note and its 5.3 inch display and say yknow, it would be great if this thing was just a little bigger, and I now I know why. As it turns out, those people live in Korea, work for Samsung, and may have decided just that.According to their usual unnamed sources, Koreas MK Business News reports that Samsungs Galaxy Note 2 will sport an even larger 5.5-inch display when its unveiled at Germanys IFA 2012 trade show in August.Naturally, the display isnt all theyre said to be upgrading here. The next-gen Galaxy Note is also rumored to pack an unspecified quad-core processor (most likely an Exynos 4 Quad), and a 12 or 13 megapixel camera around the back instead of the 8 megapixel shooter as seen in the original. To top it all off, its said to run on Googles newly-revealed Jelly Bean version of Android, though its unclear at this point how the company will be tweaking their UI to account for Jelly Beans new features.So how much of a handful is thing going to be? Well, while the display has been stretched out a bit, the device itself isnt expected to be significantly larger than the current Galaxy Note. Frankly, this seems like both a blessing and a curse  users who can comfortably wrap their mitts around the original model should do just fine, but that slightly larger display may make one-handed operation even less feasible than before.Now Im all for pushing limits and whatnot, but this just begs an obvious question: how big is too big? Most tablet manufacturers are loath to dip below the 7-inch barrier, and if this report holds true then Samsung is eagerly chipping away at the other side of that limit. Samsungs success with the Galaxy Note has also prompted companies like LG to take up the super-sized phone challenge, so its very possible that phone screen sizes havent topped out just yet.
