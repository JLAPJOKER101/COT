The Iranian lawyer for two American hikers who were released in September and repatriated after spending more than two years in a Tehran prison on charges of espionage and trespassing has been barred from leaving Iran, he confirmed in a text message. The lawyer, Masoud Shafiei, said authorities had prevented him from boarding an international flight without explanation. His destination was unclear, but the Iranian Student News Agency said he had intended to go to the United States. Last week, security forces raided his home and interrogated him about the Americans, Joshua F. Fattal and Shane M. Bauer, who denounced Iran after they left the country.
