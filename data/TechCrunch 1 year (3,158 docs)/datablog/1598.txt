The pioneer of vertical media, they call themselves. And Glam Media, the publishing network with more than 220 monthly million uniques, announced today their logical next play  a vertical food network called Foodie that will offer a social, interactive network (Portal 2.0?) for food bloggers, critics, chefs and, of course, eaters.But, as Glams co-founder and CEO Samir Arora told me when he came into our San Francisco studio today, Foodie isnt just another of Glams vertical plays. It represents what he calls a step further in Glams attempt to dominate what Arora calls the lifestyle sector. Foodie, Arora indicated, will be more social and more mobile than his companys other verticals and, Im guessing, will be a prelude to other Glam offerings in travel and wine.And that much rumored Glam IPO, I asked Arora. Could be the next next logical play in Glams relentless march to verticalize the Internet?
