Chen Xi, a liberal Chinese writer, has been sentenced to 10 years in prison on a charge of inciting subversion of the state, according to reports by news agencies on Monday that cited Mr. Chen&rsquo;s wife, Zhang Qunxuan.        

The harsh sentencing, imposed by a court in the city of Guiyang, the provincial capital of Guizhou Province, was for 36 essays that Mr. Chen had written and posted online, Ms. Zhang said.        

The Chinese government, fearing revolts of the kind that have swept across the Middle East this year, has undertaken a broad crackdown on liberal writers and artists to try and stamp out any stirrings of dissent. Intellectuals have been widely detained with no legal recourse.        

On Friday, another writer, Chen Wei, was sentenced by a court in Suining, Sichuan Province, to nine years in prison on the same charge. His lawyer said officials were offended by four essays he had written and posted online.
