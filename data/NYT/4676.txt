Iranian officials warned Monday that &ldquo;counterrevolutionaries&rdquo; from abroad were behind the flash mobs of young people who have been holding boisterous water gun fights in public parks across the country. Gen. Ahmad Radan, the acting Iranian police commander, was quoted in newspapers on Monday as saying that a number of people were arrested at an Tehran park on Friday, and he vowed that police would act to prevent future water fights. Hard-liners see the water fights as unseemly and immoral, breaking taboos against the social mixing of men and women, and they worry that the gatherings could weaken adherence to Iran&rsquo;s cleric-led Islamic rule or even build into outright protests against the ruling system.
