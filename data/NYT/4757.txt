A United Nations food agency released grim video on Friday of what it said were severely malnourished North Korean children. The Rome-based World Food Program said it shot the video at the Haeju Pediatric Hospital in the western South Hwanghae Province in mid-August. It shows health care workers pulling on the mottled, loose skin of a wailing child&rsquo;s belly, and an infant on an intravenous drip. Heavy rain and tropical storms have pounded the country in the past few months, leaving dozens of people dead or missing, displacing thousands of others and worsening chronic food shortages in rural areas. One-third of all North Korean children younger than 5 are malnourished, the organization said.
