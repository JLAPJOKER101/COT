The government of President Ollanta Humala said Wednesday that it was temporarily suspending coca eradication projects in the tropical valleys around Tingo Mar&iacute;a, one of Peru&rsquo;s top sources of coca, the plant used to make cocaine. The move opened the possibility of a shift in antinarcotics strategy in Peru, which is close to surpassing Colombia as the world&rsquo;s leading coca producer. The United States, which provides financing for Peru&rsquo;s coca eradication projects, was taken by surprise. Ambassador Rose Likins said she had not received a full explanation of the decision.
