Opposition supporters trying to join a march in Conakry were violently dispersed Tuesday, and at least four people were killed when police officers seized control of traffic circles and lobbed tear gas at people walking toward the meeting point, an opposition official said. Cellou Dalein Diallo, who lost last year&rsquo;s election to President Alpha Cond&eacute;, said that one body was dumped outside the headquarters of his party, the Union of the Democratic Forces of Guinea. A government official said 23 officers were hospitalized after being hit by rocks thrown by opposition supporters, who were protesting coming parliamentary elections, which Mr. Diallo says are rigged.
