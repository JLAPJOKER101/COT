The Sierra Leone war crimes tribunal in The Hague on Thursday granted Charles G. Taylor, the former Liberian president, the right to use two leaked American diplomatic cables as evidence to challenge the court&rsquo;s impartiality. One of the cables released by WikiLeaks quoted the United States ambassador to Liberia as warning that if Mr. Taylor were acquitted or given a light sentence, his return to Liberia could &ldquo;tip the balance in a fragile peace.&rdquo; Mr. Taylor&rsquo;s lawyers said the cables raised doubts about the court&rsquo;s independence and suggested that the prosecution was political.
