Yemen&rsquo;s vice president issued a decree on Wednesday to set up a national unity government to prepare for elections. The vice president&rsquo;s announcement paves the way for a unity government to be sworn in as part of a plan to end months of protests against the president, Ali Abdullah Saleh. Under a power-transfer plan signed last month, Mr. Saleh&rsquo;s General People&rsquo;s Congress party agreed to divide cabinet posts with its opponents in a coalition government led by an opposition leader, Mohammed Basindwa, a former foreign minister. Mr. Basindwa said he would be sworn in Saturday. Presidential elections are set for Feb. 21.
