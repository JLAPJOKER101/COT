A prominent independent documentary film festival in China, scheduled this year for May, has been canceled because of the tense atmosphere created by the continuing government crackdown on freedom of speech. The English edition of Global Times, a populist newspaper, published an article on Wednesday about the cancellation in which it quoted Zhu Rikun, the festival&rsquo;s art director, saying the organizers had decided to cancel it themselves. &ldquo;The overall situation was tense, and we had received a lot of pressure,&rdquo; Mr. Zhu said. &ldquo;We worried that the films to be shown would meet some problems in this environment and decided to cancel it.&rdquo; Another festival organizer, Li Shanshan, told Global Times that about 20 overseas guests, 10 directors and around 40 fans had registered to attend the festival. The cancellation of the festival, which is usually held every year in Songzhuang, on the outskirts of Beijing, was first announced Monday on the festival&rsquo;s microblog on sina.com.
