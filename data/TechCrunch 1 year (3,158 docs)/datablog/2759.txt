Xobni always was a clever name (its Inbox backwards), but perhaps it was too clever.  Today, the startup that tries to make your email smarter is rebranding its newer products Smartr and launching them out of private beta for Android and Gmail.These products have been in private beta for several months.  The Gmail add-on shows you contextual information about whoever is sending you an email culled from various social networks (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn) and company databases.  It also shows you your relationship history with that contact, a list of pervious email conversations and related contacts, as well as contact search.The Android app takes over your address book on your phone and delivers similar functionality.  It ranks contacts by importance and how often you communicate with them instead of alphabetically.  Since it is all managed in the cloud, it can handle thousands of contacts.  Different tabs show you contact details, that contacts recent social feeds, your relationship history, and other contacts you share in common.A Smartr iPhone app is also in the works.  If you buy a Xobni Pro account, you can sync your contacts across Gmail and your mobile devices.
