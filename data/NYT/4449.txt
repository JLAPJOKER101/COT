PARIS &mdash; Prominent members of France&rsquo;s Socialist Party expressed relief that Dominique Strauss-Kahn would soon be a free man after he was cleared Tuesday of charges of attempted rape in New York. But his political career is clearly damaged by the months of investigation and notoriety, and no one publicly urged him to run for the presidency, even though a party primary is only seven weeks away.        

Mr. Strauss-Kahn may yet have a role to play, however. He continues to command respect for his economic knowledge as a former finance minister and managing director of the International Monetary Fund, and his endorsement of another candidate will carry weight in the coming Socialist primary. It is highly likely that his voice will be important during the presidential campaign itself, as an adviser to the candidate and as a critic of the policies of President Nicolas Sarkozy.        

A Socialist victory next year could bring Mr. Strauss-Kahn into government as a minister, and a Socialist defeat might make him even more important in a party that would be seeking a new rationale.        

Mr. Strauss-Kahn said Tuesday that the judge&rsquo;s decision to dismiss the charges, at the prosecution&rsquo;s request, was the end of a personal nightmare. After thanking his family, friends and supporters, he said that he was eager to go home and that he would &ldquo;speak more forcefully when I return to France.&rdquo;        

On Tuesday, Martine Aubry, a leading Socialist candidate who is close to Mr. Strauss-Kahn and his wife, Anne Sinclair, said the news &ldquo;is a happiness, a relief,&rdquo; an end to what she called his &ldquo;nightmare.&rdquo; She said that he remained &ldquo;useful to France,&rdquo; but that &ldquo;we should let him speak for himself&rdquo; about his plans.        

Ms. Aubry&rsquo;s candidacy emerged after the charges against Mr. Strauss-Kahn precluded his own. Fran&ccedil;ois Hollande, a rival, pointed out that he had declared his own candidacy before Mr. Strauss-Kahn&rsquo;s arrest; others noted that the Hollande campaign began with Mr. Strauss-Kahn as a target.        

Mr. Hollande also expressed relief, saying that he was &ldquo;delighted for Dominique Strauss-Kahn, his friends and family for this denouement that comes after three months of unbearable ordeal and twists that were extremely hard to live through.&rdquo; Echoing Ms. Aubry, Mr. Hollande said that Mr. Strauss-Kahn&rsquo;s &ldquo;experience and expertise will be useful to his country.&rdquo; Asked if Mr. Strauss-Kahn would run for the presidency, Mr. Hollande said, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s up to him.&rdquo;        

Members of Mr. Sarkozy&rsquo;s party and government welcomed Mr. Strauss-Kahn&rsquo;s freedom. Defense Minister G&eacute;rard Longuet called the last few months &ldquo;a tremendous waste,&rdquo; adding, &ldquo;So much competence, culture, knowledge, charm should merit more than this painful affair, which will stick with him.&rdquo;        

In the field of ideas, &ldquo;people will always listen to him,&rdquo; Mr. Longuet said. &ldquo;In the field of political responsibility, I think it will be much harder for him.&rdquo;        

Jean-Fran&ccedil;ois Cop&eacute;, the secretary general of Mr. Sarkozy&rsquo;s party, the Union for a Popular Movement, described Mr. Strauss-Kahn&rsquo;s ordeal as &ldquo;a particularly heavy judicial test,&rdquo; while noting that that the U.M.P had always insisted that justice be allowed to run its course without prejudgment.        

There were also critics of the outcome, most notably women, who noted that Mr. Strauss-Kahn still faced an accusation of attempted rape in France and that victims of sexual attacks might now be less likely to go to the authorities.        

&ldquo;Bad news for justice and for women&rdquo; was the judgment of Marie-George Buffet, a Communist legislator and former government minister. The New York prosecutor&rsquo;s decision to drop the case &ldquo;poses great risks to women&rsquo;s rights, returning to a time when rape victims were a priori guilty, when rape was not considered a crime,&rdquo; she said.        

The group Osez le F&eacute;minisme or Dare Feminism, said in a statement that &ldquo;the &lsquo;credibility&rsquo; of plaintiffs &mdash; a key word these last few months &mdash; is constantly put into question in matters of rape.&rdquo;

&ldquo;However, we say it once again: There is no such thing as a good or bad victim. Nothing that a woman has done or said in the past should permit us to minimize the damage she has suffered.&rdquo;        

G&eacute;rard Grunberg, a political scientist who studies the left in France, said that Mr. Strauss-Kahn&rsquo;s &ldquo;image in public opinion is very damaged&rdquo; and the Socialist Party itself, already annoyed with him for ruining an important political opportunity to challenge Mr. Sarkozy and with its primary soon, &ldquo;does not want to have this collective occasion spoiled.&rdquo;        

&ldquo;I believe that he can no longer claim a leading role in French politics,&rdquo; Mr. Grunberg said. &ldquo;Neither the public nor the party want to see him back on the front line.&rdquo;        

In an editorial, the left-leaning newspaper Le Monde said that like Bill Clinton, &ldquo;whose presidency was tarnished by the Monica Lewinsky affair, he is above all a victim of his own imprudence.&rdquo; Whatever the merits, the newspaper said, the case &ldquo;lifted the veil on aspects of his personality, his relations with women and with money,&rdquo; and noted that the decision not to prosecute was not a declaration of his innocence.        

Many also noted that a civil case against him is still pending in New York, as is another complaint filed by a French writer, Tristane Banon, who said he tried to rape her in 2003. French prosecutors are investigating. Her lawyer, David Koubbi, said that Ms. Banon&rsquo;s case and credibility were not damaged by the events in New York and that Ms. Banon &ldquo;is combative&rdquo; and &ldquo;saddened&rdquo; by what happened to the accuser in New York, Nafissatou Diallo, &ldquo;because she believes her.&rdquo;        

And Ms. Diallo&rsquo;s Paris lawyer, Thibault de Montbrial, said he had filed a complaint against an ally of Mr. Strauss-Kahn, accusing the ally of trying to bribe a woman who claimed to have had an affair with Mr. Strauss-Kahn in order to persuade her not to testify in the civil suit.
