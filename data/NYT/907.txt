The deposed president Marc Ravalomanana, left, living in exile since March 2009, announced Thursday that he would return to his island nation on Saturday even though the current government threatens to jail him. Speaking to reporters in Johannesburg, he repeatedly sidestepped questions about his possible arrest and the risk that his presence could incite civil war. &ldquo;I will bring peaceful dialogue,&rdquo; he insisted. Mr. Ravalomanana, twice elected Madagascar&rsquo;s president, was ousted by a military-backed coup and then convicted in absentia on murder charges resulting from the killing of protesters by the presidential guard.
