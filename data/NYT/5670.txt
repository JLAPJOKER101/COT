A man was sentenced to 20 years in prison on Friday for the murder of a Slavic soccer fan that incited an ethnic riot in Moscow last December. The gunman, Aslan Cherkesov, fatally shot the soccer fan in a drunken brawl at a bus stop. Five other people who took part in the brawl were sentenced to five years in jail each. All six are natives of the predominantly Muslim Caucasus region.
