Very rarely do we see gaming startups launch on the rather limited platform of SMS. Mobile games are all about the graphics, the functionality, and the ability to leverage the very best of technology through an app. But StrayBoots, a real-world scavenger hunt via text, has managed to generate $200,000 in revenue over the past 12 months, with nearly 50,000 paying customers.Oh, and did I mention that its all through SMS?The margins must be incredible, considering that CEO Avi Millman explained that each two- to three-hour scavenger hunt costs the user between $6 and $12 and its currently only available on one phone per game.The company also has deals in place with Time Out, Serious Eats, MyCityWay, and Leisure Pass North America, wherein the partnerships will create co-branded nightlife and food games that are to be promoted by both parties.It works rather simply: just go to the StrayBoots website and choose a city and a game category, like restaurants or museums. Youll then be emailed a code for your game, and once youre in the specified starting point, just text the code in to StrayBoots. You can go at whatever pace youd like, and play on a team, against a team, or by yourself.The game currently supports walking tours in the following locations: New York, Chicago, San Francisco, Las Vegas, Washington D.C., Seattle, Boston, Los Angeles, Nashville, New Orleans, Philadelphia, Portland, San Diego, and the U.K.iOS and Android apps are in the works.
