A court issued an arrest warrant on Monday for the son of former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia on charges that he transferred millions of dollars in bribes overseas. The son, Tarique Rahman, has been living in London and refused to return to attend the hearing. Prosecutors said he and a friend smuggled $2.73 million he received in bribes to Singapore while his mother was prime minister. In June, another son of Ms. Zia was sentenced to six years in jail for money laundering.
