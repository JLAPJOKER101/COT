The United States on Wednesday imposed sanctions against two Iranian officials for what it said were human rights abuses against protesters after the disputed 2009  election. The Treasury Department said that the Tehran prosecutor general, Abbas Jafari-Dolatabadi, and the commander of the Basiji forces of the Revolutionary Guard Corps, Mohammad Reza Naqdi, had been added to its  blacklist.
