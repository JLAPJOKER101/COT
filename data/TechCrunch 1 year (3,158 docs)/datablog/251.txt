The Gillmor Gang — Robert Scoble, Keith Teare, John Taschek, and Steve Gillmor — played Minority Report The Home Version as Google entered the Tablet Wars. The Nexus 7 or some such is actually a phenomenal device, and brings the Goog back from the Slow Death of Fragmentation and a step ahead of Microsoft SquareFace.Now weve got two push notification platforms that will actually get built out, as long as Google keeps the Nexus refreshed on the latest Android build. Whether the Gang members are right about the timing remains to be deciphered from the conversation, but its clear sailing for a unification of the metadata if not the actual notification streams.@stevegillmor, @scobleizer, @jtaschek, @kteareProduced and directed by Tina Chase Gillmor @tinagillmor
