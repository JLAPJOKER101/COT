With all this fuzz and fizzle going down with TC inside politics, departures, and whispered depictions of TC as a sinking ship populated by the shambling walking dead, rats clawing through our brainpans and dropping out onto our laps as our fingers shamble across our filthy, befouled keyboards, low groans of agony and anger gurgling out of our deepest, darkest spaces, I thought it would be a good idea to go over some of the things were focusing on here on the site and offer a bit of guidance for start-ups looking to make it in Boston, DC, NYC, and Hilton Head, South Carolina.Were a very SF/Valley-centered blog, but what are New York, Washington, Virginia, and/or Florida? Chopped liver? I think not. What about Chicago, Atlanta, and Scranton? They may not have In-N-Out, but by gum they do have hamburgers just as good as those found in Palo Alto.To that end, Id like to remind East Coast startups to contact us through our tips@techcrunch.com email or contact me directly at john@techcrunch.com. Im happy to hop on a train or plane to come and see your digs and are trying our darnedest to go back to our original mission of ferreting out the cool and exciting in the wild world of tech.Wed also love to talk to more hardware start-ups. Anyone who isnt making an iPad/iPhone case with a little swivelly arm on the back should contact us as well.So get cracking on your pitches and watch this space for upcoming events in the Windy Apple, the Big Peach, Cow-lumbus, Pittsadelphia and other cities. Theres no reason we cant get together, pour a few beers (or, in my case, flaming 151 shots) down our gullets, and talk tech. We, as they say, dont bite.
