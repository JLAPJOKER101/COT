Mauritania&rsquo;s army conducted an air raid in a forest across the border in Mali on Thursday, aimed at preventing an attack by an insurgent cell there linked to Al Qaeda, the Defense Ministry said. Mauritania sent planes over the Wagadou Forest, an officer involved in the raid said, and attacked two cars full of explosives and militants who were preparing to attack Mauritania. The North African branch of Al Qaeda, Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, has a base in the Wagadou Forest. Mauritanian troops backed by Malian foot soldiers raided the same area in June.
