The future of Somalia&rsquo;s transitional government became even more uncertain on Tuesday after the prime minister, Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed, announced that he was refusing to resign, defying an agreement last week between Somalia&rsquo;s president and Parliament speaker that included a reshuffling of the cabinet. Mr. Mohamed is popular among many Somalis and soldiers, and riots erupted last week when the president and the Parliament speaker said that Mr. Mohamed would be replaced. The president and speaker had bickered over whether to hold elections in August and agreed to a deal to extend Somalia&rsquo;s weak transitional government for another year and to make changes in the cabinet. Mr. Mohamed says he will step down only if the full Parliament orders him to do so.
