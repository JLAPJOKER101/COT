Prosecutors said Friday that three members of the Pakistani cricket team that toured England last summer would be tried on charges of &ldquo;spot-fixing&rdquo; elements of a five-day contest in London in August. The three men &mdash; Mohammed Amir, Salman Butt and Mohammed Asif &mdash; will face charges of conspiracy to accept  bribes and conspiracy to cheat. Their agent, Mazhar Majeed, was also indicted.  The four are alleged to have accepted tens of thousands of dollars in illicit payments from a News of the World reporter posing as a middleman for Asia-based betting syndicates.
