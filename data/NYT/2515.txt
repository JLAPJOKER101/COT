An aid flotilla will depart for the Gaza Strip in the third week of June, just over a year after a similar flotilla was raided by Israeli forces, activists said Monday. A coalition of pro-Palestinian groups announced the date after a meeting in Paris. The plans set up a possible confrontation with Israel, which has vowed to stop any attempt to breach its sea blockade of Gaza. Activists had originally planned to depart on May 31, the anniversary of the Israeli raid. Turkish activists had said they wanted to leave after Turkey&rsquo;s June 12 parliamentary elections.
