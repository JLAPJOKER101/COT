The Ugandan government briefly detained the wife of the country&rsquo;s leading opposition figure on Monday. The woman, Winnie Byanyima, the wife of the opposition leader Kizza Besigye and a senior director at the United Nations Development Program in New York, had been on her way to the airport to fly to the United States when her car was stopped by security forces and towed to a police station. She was soon released. Mr. Besigye has staged twice-weekly street demonstrations over the last month and has been arrested repeatedly.
