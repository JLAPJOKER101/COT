French authorities said that 75 bodies had been pulled from the Atlantic Ocean in the past week, nearly two years after the crash of an Air France flight from Rio de Janeiro to Paris. That brings the total number of bodies recovered since June 1, 2009, to 127. All 228 people aboard the plane died. An initial reading of the cockpit and data recorders from the flight show that the Airbus 330 went into a high-altitude stall that the pilot was unable to rectify. Initial reports also confirmed suspicions that a loss of consistent speed readings set off the chain of events that brought down the plane.
