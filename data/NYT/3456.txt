The Tanzanian government has indicated that it will not build a highway through the Serengeti National Park, a plan that conservation groups worried would ruin one of the world&rsquo;s greatest migrations of animals. In a letter dated June 22, Ezekiel Maige, Tanzania&rsquo;s natural resources and tourism minister, said that the roads in the park would remain gravel and that the government is &ldquo;seriously considering&rdquo; building a highway south of the Serengeti.
