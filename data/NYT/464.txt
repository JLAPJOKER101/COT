DAKAR, Senegal &mdash; Openly defying its West African neighbors, the government of Laurent Gbagbo, the Ivory Coast strongman who is increasingly short of cash in the face of international sanctions, says it will seize local branches of the region&rsquo;s central bank.        

Mr. Gbagbo, who refuses to step down despite losing a presidential election in November, has been officially cut off from access to Ivory Coast&rsquo;s accounts at the bank, which groups the treasuries of eight West African nations.        

But Mr. Gbagbo&rsquo;s finance minister announced on state television Tuesday night that the bank&rsquo;s branches in Ivory Coast, including the central one in the commercial capital of Abidjan, would be &ldquo;requisitioned, along with the staff.&rdquo; The minister, D&eacute;sir&eacute; Dallo, said the move was prompted by the need to pay state pensions, adding that the decision to bar Mr. Gbagbo from access to the bank was &ldquo;criminal.&rdquo;        

For weeks, Ivorian government troops and armored vehicles have been posted outside the Abidjan branch &mdash; a show of force that diplomats said was meant to demonstrate Mr. Gbagbo&rsquo;s ultimate authority over the funds inside. It is unclear how West African leaders, who have threatened to remove Mr. Gbagbo by force if he does not step down, would respond to the seizure of branches of their collective bank. The money belongs to Ivory Coast, but regional leaders have declared that only the country&rsquo;s legitimate government &mdash; not Mr. Gbagbo&rsquo;s &mdash; should have access.        

Beyond the ban, asset freezes imposed by the European Union and the United States, along with prohibitions against doing business with Gbagbo-controlled state institutions, have rained down on the defeated leader, but he has shown few signs of relenting.        

The announcement that Mr. Gbagbo&rsquo;s government would seize bank branches was apparently precipitated by the forced resignation last weekend of the governor of the central bank, Philippe-Henri Dacoury-Tabley. He is a Gbagbo ally and had been allowing the defeated president continued access to the accounts, despite the decision, by regional finance ministers in December to cut off Mr. Gbagbo&rsquo;s government.        

The practical effect of Mr. Gbagbo&rsquo;s decision to &ldquo;requisition&rdquo; the bank branches could help him hold onto power a little longer. A minister in the rival government of Alassane Ouattara &mdash; who was recognized by the international community as the winner of the November election &mdash; said in a telephone interview that $200 million of the country&rsquo;s cash was in the  central bank branches, and that, in theory, &ldquo;they could go in and rob the cash registers.&rdquo;
