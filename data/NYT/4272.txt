A court handed down prison terms on Friday for relatives of the former first lady of Tunisia for trying to flee illegally with jewels and cash as her husband&rsquo;s government collapsed. Two sisters of the former first lady, Leila Trabelsi, were sentenced to 18 months and 6 months respectively, while a nephew was sentenced to two years. A total of 32 people, identified as family members and collaborators, faced charges including possession of foreign cash without permission of the Central Bank or trafficking in jewels. The sentences ranged from four months to six years in prison, and fines totaled $144.5 million. The defendants were detained at the Tunis airport as they tried to board a plane on Jan. 14, when President Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali fled to Saudi Arabia.
