Denmark plans to lay claim to parts of the North Pole and other areas in the Arctic, where melting ice is uncovering new shipping routes, fishing grounds and drilling opportunities for oil and gas, a leaked government document showed Tuesday. The draft document, titled &ldquo;Strategy for the Arctic,&rdquo; said Denmark&rsquo;s Science Ministry had started collecting data to formally submit a claim for those areas no later than 2014 to the United Nations Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf. Russia, Norway and the United States have their own claims &mdash; sometimes competing &mdash; in a region believed to hold as much as 25 percent of the world&rsquo;s undiscovered oil and gas.
