PARIS (AP) &mdash; Underwater search teams have found pieces of an Air France plane that crashed in the Atlantic in 2009, killing all 228 people on board, French investigators said Sunday.        

Three previous extensive &mdash; and costly &mdash; searches have failed to determine why Air France Flight 447, an Airbus 330 en route to Paris from Rio de Janeiro, slammed into the ocean during an intense high-altitude thunderstorm.        

The French air accident investigation agency B.E.A. said in a statement on Sunday night that a team aboard the expedition ship Alucia had found pieces of the plane in the previous 24 hours. The agency did not identify what parts of the plane were found, or where.        

Searchers are carrying out a fourth effort to find wreckage of the plane &mdash; and especially its flight recorders &mdash; in hopes of determining the cause of the crash, which has taken on a new urgency after a French judge filed preliminary manslaughter charges last month against Air France and the plane&rsquo;s maker, Airbus. Experts say that without the flight data and voice recorders the authorities would be unlikely to determine the cause.        

Air France and Airbus are financing the estimated $12.5 million cost of the new search. About $28 million has already been spent on the three previous searches for the jet.        

The team involved in this weekend&rsquo;s discovery was led by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, based on Cape Cod. The search is being carried out in an area of about 3,900 square miles several hundred miles off the northeast coast of Brazil.
