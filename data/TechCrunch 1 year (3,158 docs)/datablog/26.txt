Crazy Egg, a company that helps website owners to visualize visitor activity, has acquired the web toolbar product Hello Bar.The Hello Bar is a customizable, relatively unobtrusive bar that sits at the top of a website and directs visitors with a call to action. For example, the bar on Gary Vaynerchuks website prompts visitors to Circle me up on Google+!, while the one at Eric Ries Startup Lessons Learned points to the video of his Lean Startup track at this years SXSW.Amee Shah, who runs Crazy Eggs day-to-day operations, says the company was looking for products that were similar to its own in that they help people improve the user experience on their websites and they also are very simple and easy to use. So she found the Hello Bar and started talking to the company that made it, Digital Telepathy. (Digital Telepathy started out as a design agency, but when I spoke to CEO Chuck Longanecker earlier about the companys SlideDeck plugin for WordPress earlier this year, he said the team is becoming increasingly product-focused.)The financial terms of the acquisition arent being disclosed, but Shah says the current Hello Bar team will not be joining Crazy Egg. The company plans to operate Hello Bar as a separate product, witha few engineers on Hello Bar to keep evolving the product based on customer needs.And we can expect more acquisitions from Crazy Egg in the future, Shah says, specifically of products that align with our philosophy of building really simple, easy to use products that do one thing really well.Both Crazy Egg and Digital Telepathy are self-funded.
