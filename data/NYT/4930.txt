Four earthquakes hit southern Guatemala within a two-and-a-half-hour period on Monday, shaking buildings in the capital and killing three people. The quakes struck near Guatemala&rsquo;s southwestern coast, forcing the evacuation of about 400 people and cutting electricity and telephone services to the area, officials said. One woman was killed when her house collapsed in the town of Cuilapa, and two others died after their cars were buried in a landslide near Chiquimulilla. The initial magnitude 4.8 earthquake was followed about 30 minutes later by a magnitude 5.8 quake and two smaller ones after that, the United States Geological Survey said. The epicenters were east and northeast of Cuilapa, the geological survey said.
