A high court in Spain issued a summons Thursday to the son-in-law of King Juan Carlos as a suspect in a spreading fraud scandal that involves millions of dollars in public money given to his private foundation. A judge in Palma, Majorca, called on the son-in-law, I&ntilde;aki Urdangarin, 43, to face questioning on Feb. 6 about allegations that he used his royal credentials to secure multimillion-dollar contracts for his foundation, the No&oacute;s Institute, to organize sports and tourism events. After he was named as a formal suspect on Thursday, the Spanish palace and a number of government institutions issued careful comments offering &ldquo;respect&rdquo; for the decision of judges. The king has taken a number of steps to keep a distance from his son-in-law, whose family did not spend Christmas Eve with the royal family for the first time in years.
