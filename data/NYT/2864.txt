PESHAWAR, Pakistan &mdash; Twenty-five people were killed and 30 wounded, 10 seriously, in a suicide bombing in the southwestern town of Hangu on Thursday evening.        

A official of a bomb disposal squad said the explosives were substantial, weighing nearly 1,000 pounds.        

&ldquo;Many people are still trapped in the rubble, and therefore the death toll may go up,&rdquo; said the deputy inspector general of police, Kohat Masud Afridi.        

Two police officers were killed in the bombing, which Mr. Afridi said was in retaliation for a military-backed tribal action against Pakistani militants in the Central Kurram tribal region.        

&ldquo;The target was the people and not the police,&rdquo; Mr. Afridi said, adding that the militants were escalating attacks and using more explosives to inflict maximum damage.        

On Wednesday, a suicide bomber rammed an explosives-laden vehicle into a post of the Pakistani Criminal Investigation Department in Peshawar, killing seven police officers.        

Pakistani Taliban based in North Waziristan accepted responsibility for both the attacks.        

A local reporter in Miramshah, the main city of the tribal area of North Waziristan, said that a pamphlet purportedly circulated by a Pakistani militant group had called for more attacks on Pakistani installations to avenge the death of Osama bin Laden this month.
