But when you think of real-life expert marksmen, you usually think of people who have served in the military or the police force  or at least, people who live in rural areas with big yards where they can practice shooting on empty cans of Keystone Light (not that I have any familiarity with that.) San Francisco Bay Area techies dont usually fit in with any of those sterotypes.Thats why Chris Chengs rise has been especially fascinating. Chengs day job is as a program and project manager at Googles Silicon Valley headquarters, but millions of people have come to know him in recent months as a contestant on the fourth season of Top Shot, a reality competition show airing on the History Channel in which 18 contestants battle it out to win the title as the top target shooter. With four episodes left until the season finale, Cheng is still in the running as one of the eight contestants gunning for the Top Shot title.So we were really happy to have Cheng stop by the TechCrunch TV studio for an interview. Watch the interview above to hear him talk about his brush with reality TV fame, how working in tech has made him a better shooter, what the response to Top Shot has been like from the tech community, and more. The show airs on Tuesday nights at 10pm PT, 9pm CT, and its also available on Hulu. To see Chris Cheng in action, you can watch the clip weve embedded below:
