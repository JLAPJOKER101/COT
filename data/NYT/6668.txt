MEXICO CITY (AP) &mdash; The Mexican army said Sunday that it had captured the head of security for the Sinaloa drug cartel&rsquo;s leader, Joaqu&iacute;n Guzm&aacute;n, known as El Chapo, one of the world&rsquo;s richest and most wanted men.        

The suspect, who was not identified by name, was captured in the Sinaloa state capital of Culiac&aacute;n, the army said.        

Mr. Guzm&aacute;n, Mexico&rsquo;s top drug lord, is estimated by Forbes to be worth more than $1 billion. He has eluded the authorities by moving around since his 2001 prison escape in a laundry truck.        

The army said the man it had arrested was responsible for carrying out secret burials of cartel victims, kidnapping, extortion and arson. It was unclear if the arrest moved the military closer to capturing Mr. Guzm&aacute;n.
