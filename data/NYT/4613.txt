Europe&rsquo;s human rights chief made a blistering attack on Thursday on the counterterrorism actions of European governments, accusing them of helping the United States commit what he called &ldquo;countless&rdquo; crimes in the past 10 years. The Council of Europe&rsquo;s rights commissioner, Thomas Hammarberg, said the 10-year anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks was an occasion to analyze whether the official responses have been proper and effective. &ldquo;In attempting to combat crimes attributed to terrorists, countless further crimes have been committed in the course of the U.S.-led &lsquo;global war on terror,&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; he said in a statement. &ldquo;Many of those crimes have been carefully and deliberately covered up.&rdquo; The 47-nation Council of Europe believes that more than a dozen European nations colluded in the C.I.A.&rsquo;s rendition program, which involved capturing suspects and sending them to third-party countries for questioning in secret prisons. The council says that in some cases the nations participated by allowing the C.I.A. and other United States government agencies to use their airspace and airports while transporting terrorism suspects.
