The European Court of Human Rights ruled Friday that crucifixes are acceptable in public school classrooms, a decision that will be binding in 47 countries. The ruling overturned its decision in an Italian case in 2009 that said the crucifix could be disturbing to non-Christian or atheist pupils. Several countries, led by Italy, appealed that ruling. In its ruling on Friday, the court said it found no evidence &ldquo;that the display of such a symbol on classroom walls might have an influence on pupils.&rdquo; Italy&rsquo;s foreign minister, Franco Frattini, applauded the decision, saying, &ldquo;The popular sentiment in Europe has won today.&rdquo;
