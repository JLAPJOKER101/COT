Weve been having our fun with the things Google has been saying lately, but its worth looking at how people with money on the table are feeling about the company. Which is, pretty good compared to most other tech rivals, including Apple in the post-Steve Jobs era.Google stock is up 16.16% in the past three months. The only other company thats had a net positive over the same period is, er, Yahoo.Whats making Google go up? Maybe its Larry Pages aggressive new strategy to cut weaker products and focus on big new areas like mobile and social. Maybe its because the company has been beating earnings since he came in? Maybe its specifically Androids growth (however fast that may be). Maybe its the not-failed user numbers coming in for Google+? Maybe its just the overall steady growth of its core advertising business? Or maybe traders have figured out some other information thats not publicly available.Obviously this is a small snapshot. If you zoom out to year to date, for example, Apple is the big winner. Its up 17.87% versus Googles 4.05%. And really, the big question here is why Apples stock is trading s0 low. Thats the question everyone keeps asking themselves. The stock price suggests that investors think therell be negative cash flow growth, which as Eric Savitz sketches out the other day, is basically impossible given the growth of all of its businesses.Disclosure: As a daily user of Apple hardware and Google software (but not the other way around) I have no particular loyalty or disloyalty to either company, or any other company for that matter.
