President Mahinda Rajapaksa said Thursday that Sri Lanka&rsquo;s wartime emergency laws, which have curbed civil and political liberties for most of the past 30 years, would be lifted next week. The country has been under intense international pressure to end the measures, which allow the government to detain suspects without trial, displace residents from their land and set up ubiquitous military checkpoints. More than two years after the end of the country&rsquo;s civil war, Mr. Rajapaksa told the legislature that the laws were no longer needed.
