JOHANNESBURG &mdash; Madagascar&rsquo;s ousted president, Marc Ravalomanana, was prevented from boarding a commercial flight here on Saturday, stymieing his attempt to return home after two years in exile.        

&ldquo;I am going to Madagascar for peace, not war. Why are they stopping me here now?&rdquo; he said to reporters who had accompanied him to the airport.        

Mr. Ravalomanana, with tickets in hand for himself and his family, arrived two hours early. But officials from the airline South African Airlink informed him that the Malagasy government had requested that he be turned away.        

He was shown a letter from the island nation&rsquo;s civil aviation board. It read in part: Mr. Ravalomanana &ldquo;and company are non grata persons in Madagascar. So to preserve public order don&rsquo;t take them aboard.&rdquo;        

His return would most likely have provoked a confrontation. The former president, deposed in a military-backed coup in March 2009, was last year convicted in absentia of murder, a case stemming from the deaths of at least 25 antigovernment protesters shot by Mr. Ravalomanana&rsquo;s presidential guard. He would face arrest if he came home.        

But Mr. Ravalomanana, elected in 2001 and re-elected in 2006, retains a sizable following. Expecting his return, a large crowd already had gathered at the airport in Antananarivo, the nation&rsquo;s capital, witnesses said.        

Madagascar, with a population of 20 million, lies off Africa&rsquo;s southeastern coast. Its current government was installed by mutinous military officers and is led by Andry Rajoelina, the former mayor of Antananarivo.        

Most of the international community has shunned the new government, drastically curtailing aid to one of the world&rsquo;s poorest countries.
