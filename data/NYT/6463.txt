An Afghan woman who was jailed on charges of &ldquo;forced adultery&rdquo; after being raped, then pardoned following an international outcry, has been released nearly two weeks after a judicial panel said she could go free, her lawyer said Wednesday. But the future of the Afghan woman, Gulnaz, remains unclear. Gulnaz, who uses one name and is now 21, was attacked by her cousin&rsquo;s husband in 2009 and gave birth to a daughter behind bars. The government announcement of the pardon made it clear that there was an expectation that she would agree to marry her rapist, a way of ensuring the child was not treated as illegitimate. But her lawyer said that since Gulnaz&rsquo;s attacker was still in jail, the question of whether she would marry him was off the table for the moment.
