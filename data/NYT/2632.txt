JERUSALEM &mdash; Tensions were high in East Jerusalem on Saturday as hundreds of Palestinians buried a 17-year-old demonstrator and preparations were under way for rallies on Sunday to mark the founding of Israel 63 years ago, an event that Palestinians call the &ldquo;nakba,&rdquo; Arabic for catastrophe.        

The dead teenager, Milad Ayyash, was shot in the stomach on Friday during stone-throwing demonstrations in the Jerusalem neighborhood of Silwan and died in the hospital on Saturday. A police spokesman, Micky Rosenfeld, said police officers had not used live fire and were investigating the cause of his death.        

Witnesses said the gunshot came from inside Beit Yonatan, a Jewish-owned building in Silwan, either from a security guard or a resident. The teenager&rsquo;s family declined to allow a police autopsy, Mr. Rosenfeld said.        

On Saturday, mourners carried the boy&rsquo;s body through East Jerusalem. When the procession passed Beit Yonatan, they threw rocks at the building. The police arrested four people and used stun grenades, causing several light injuries. The burial took place without further disturbance.        

The police presence is expected to be heavy across Israel on Sunday. &ldquo;Obviously what happened yesterday and today will influence how we deploy tomorrow,&rdquo; Mr. Rosenfeld said.        

After Israel declared independence on May 14, 1948, armies from neighboring Arab states attacked the new nation; during the war that followed, hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were driven from their homes by Israeli forces. Hundreds of Palestinian villages were also destroyed. The refugees and their descendants remain a central issue of contention in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.        

Israel celebrates its independence&nbsp;day according to&nbsp;the Hebrew calendar, which this year was last Tuesday.
