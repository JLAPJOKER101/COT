Three people were killed in a grenade attack in the capital, Kigali, on Friday night, witnesses said. Witnesses said a man riding a motorcycle tossed the grenade into a crowd and sped off. More than 25 people were wounded. Three suspects have been arrested. Violent crime is rare in Rwanda, though politics are getting turbulent. The government has blamed previous grenade attacks on rebel groups.
