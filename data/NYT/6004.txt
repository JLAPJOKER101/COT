Russia is facing a heightened risk of being drawn into conflicts at its borders that have the potential of turning nuclear, the country&rsquo;s top military officer said Thursday. Gen. Nikolai Makarov, chief of the General Staff of the Russian armed forces, cautioned over NATO&rsquo;s expansion eastward and warned that the risks of Russia being pulled into local conflicts have &ldquo;risen sharply.&rdquo; He added, according to Russian news agencies, that &ldquo;under certain conditions, local and regional conflicts may develop into a full-scale war involving nuclear weapons.&rdquo; He specifically referred to NATO&rsquo;s plans to offer membership to Georgia and Ukraine as potentially threatening Russia&rsquo;s security.
