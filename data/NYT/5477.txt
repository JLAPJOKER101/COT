PARIS &mdash; France&rsquo;s first lady, Carla Bruni-Sarkozy, gave birth to a girl on Wednesday evening. She is the first baby born to a modern-day French president while in office, the newspaper Le Figaro reported.        

There was no official confirmation of the birth, The Associated Press reported.        

Ms. Bruni-Sarkozy was admitted to a maternity clinic in Paris on Wednesday, where her husband, President Nicolas Sarkozy, visited her for 30 minutes before heading to Frankfurt for talks with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and other officials about the debt crisis affecting the 17 nations that use the euro.        

Ms. Bruni-Sarkozy, 43, a model turned singer who married Mr. Sarkozy in 2008, has a son, Aur&eacute;lien, 10, from a previous relationship with the French philosopher Rapha&euml;l Enthoven. Mr. Sarkozy has three sons from his first two marriages, and he became a grandfather last year.        

Ms. Bruni-Sarkozy often expressed her desire to be a mother for the second time, including during a state visit to India in December.        

In a recent interview, Ms. Bruni-Sarkozy said that her pregnancy &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t interest French people,&rdquo; and that she did not want her baby to be subject to much public attention.
