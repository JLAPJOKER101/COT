More than 10,000 people in northern Myanmar have fled fighting between government troops and an ethnic minority militia, and are living in temporary camps near the Chinese border as refugees, members of the minority group said Thursday. The Kachin News Group, associated with Kachin antigovernment exiles, said the refugees had fled territory under government control.
