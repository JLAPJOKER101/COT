MOSCOW &mdash; An early-morning explosion deep in a coal mine in Ukraine on Friday killed 17 miners and left 9 others missing in a nation where poor maintenance and lax safety regulation make mining a perilous profession.        

Officials said 11 people were injured. It was the deadliest mine disaster in Ukraine since 2007, when a blast at a nearby mine killed more than 100 people.        

The accident, which officials said was probably caused by an explosion of methane, occurred at 2 a.m., when 252 people were working the night shift about 3,000 feet underground, a regional mining official told the Interfax news agency.        

Underscoring the dangers in Ukrainian mines, an elevator used to transport miners and equipment at another mine collapsed on Friday, killing two workers and injuring eight others, the Emergencies Ministry said.        

President Viktor F. Yanukovich and Prime Minister Mykola Azarov planned to fly to the accident site, their offices said. The president ordered the government to set up a commission to investigate the blast.        

Friday&rsquo;s explosion struck the Suhodolsky-Eastern mine in the Luhansk region, where 58 people were killed in an explosion in 1992. A fire broke out at the mine last month, but there were no reports of injuries. About 600,000 people are employed in Ukrainian mines, which are reported to have the world&rsquo;s highest coal industry death rate. Mykhailo Volynets, the head of the Independent Trade Union of Miners, told news agencies that 70 percent of the equipment in Ukrainian mines was outdated and needed to be replaced.        

The accidents are often caused by explosions of methane, a colorless and odorless gas that seeps out of coal seams and can build up in poorly ventilated mine shafts. Ukraine&rsquo;s mine elevators, made of wooden planks, are unstable, and the ropes that haul miners down the shafts are often tattered.
