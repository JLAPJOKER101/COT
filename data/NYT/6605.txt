A judge in Dublin has ruled that a senior Irish Republican Army veteran wanted in the United States over links to a North Korean counterfeiting plot should not be extradited. The I.R.A. member, Sean Garland, has been fighting extradition from the Republic of Ireland since his arrest in 2009. He fled from Northern Ireland, which is part of the United Kingdom, when on bail and facing extradition on the same charges in 2005. A federal indictment in the United States accuses Mr. Garland, 77, of circulating North Korean forgeries of American $100 bills in the 1990s in cooperation with the Russian Communist Party and British criminal contacts. Mr. Garland denies the accusation. The Dublin judge, Justice John A. Edwards of the High Court, said Wednesday that he would explain his decision on Jan. 13.
