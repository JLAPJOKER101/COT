The Palestinians will seek United Nations recognition as an independent state in September even if peace negotiations with Israel are under way, a Palestinian diplomat said Thursday. Riyad Mansour, the Palestinian envoy to the United Nations, said the Palestinians were working on three independent tracks: restarting negotiations, building institutions for an independent state and gaining recognition for statehood. &ldquo;If we succeed in opening the door for negotiations, we&rsquo;re not going to stop from attaining what belongs to us as Palestinians in this General Assembly starting on Sept. 20,&rdquo; he said. American and European diplomats have been trying to restart Israeli-Palestinian negotiations, hoping progress could avert a United Nations vote, which they see as counterproductive.
