Police officers investigating the deaths of five patients at a hospital in northern England said Friday that they had charged a 27-year-old nurse in the case. The police and prosecutors say that Rebecca Leighton endangered the lives of patients at the Stepping Hill Hospital in Stockport, near Manchester, by damaging saline bags and vials and unspecified medical products. Saline is the saltwater solution used to deliver intravenous drugs or keep patients hydrated. The police had said that saline at the hospital had been spiked with insulin. Overdosing on insulin can lead to low blood sugar, which in extreme cases can lead to convulsions, coma or death. The alarm was raised last week after a some hospital&rsquo;s patients suffered unexplained low blood sugar levels. The police said it was likely that more deaths would be investigated.
