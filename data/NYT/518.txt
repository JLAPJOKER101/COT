A leading candidate for governor of Borno State was fatally shot Friday, along with six other people. Gunmen on motorcycles followed the candidate, Modu Fannami Gubio, from a mosque after Friday Prayer and shot him and six others as they got out of a jeep outside his home, witnesses said. The attack bore the hallmarks of the radical Islamist sect Boko Haram.
