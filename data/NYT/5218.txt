A Yemeni medical official said Tuesday that pro-government forces had fired mortar shells in the southern city of Taiz after two days of clashes there with armed tribesmen, killing seven people and seriously wounding 10. The tribesmen support antigovernment protesters seeking the ouster of President Ali Abdullah Saleh. The medical official spoke on the condition of anonymity, saying he feared government reprisal.
