Defying a government order, a small French boat quietly left Greek waters early Tuesday and set course for the Gaza Strip, coordinators announced later in the day, when the craft had reached international waters. It was the first vessel to successfully depart Greek territorial waters aiming to be part of an international flotilla challenging Israel&rsquo;s naval blockade.        

But organizers were undecided as to whether the vessel, carrying eight pro-Palestinian activists, a journalist and three crew members, would indeed continue on course to Gaza. It was unclear that the boat had enough fuel to reach the Gaza coast.        

&ldquo;It&rsquo;s kind of in a holding pattern for the moment,&rdquo; said one organizer, Adam Shapiro. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re trying to find out what is the next step.&rdquo;        

Last week, Greece decreed that no ships would be permitted to sail from its territorial waters toward &ldquo;the maritime area of Gaza,&rdquo; later citing safety concerns for the passengers of such ships. The Greek Coast Guard has turned back two flotilla boats, and the harbor authorities have held others in port for what they call administrative irregularities or seaworthiness issues.        

Organizers had kept the location of the French boat a secret, and moored it in open water, not at a dock, so as to avoid alerting the Greek authorities to its presence.        

Separately on Tuesday, a Greek court released the American captain of The Audacity of Hope, the United States-flagged boat that set out for Gaza from Athens last week but was almost immediately stopped by the coast guard and impounded. The captain, John Klusmire, was jailed Saturday after a judge advanced initial charges of endangering the vessel&rsquo;s passengers, a felony, and disobeying an official directive. The charges have been dropped, said Mr. Shapiro, the organizer.
