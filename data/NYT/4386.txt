Gunmen attacked a police patrol in eastern India on Friday, fatally shooting nine officers and one civilian, the police said. The attackers, suspected of being Maoist rebels, fled after an exchange of gunfire with the police in the Bijapur district of Chhattisgarh State, said Ramnivas, a police official who uses one name. The rebels opened fire as the police officers returned to their base on foot after routine patrolling in the area, Ramnivas said. The civilian was carrying their supplies, he told The Associated Press. The Press Trust of India news agency earlier reported that 11 police officers had been killed.
