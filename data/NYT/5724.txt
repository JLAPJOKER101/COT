President Juan Manuel Santos dissolved the country&rsquo;s main intelligence agency, the sprawling Administrative Department of Security, or DAS, after a series of scandals that severely damaged the agency&rsquo;s credibility. DAS illegally spied on human rights activists, judges and political leaders, and its former spymaster, Jorge Noguera, was recently convicted of collaborating with paramilitary assassination squads in the murder of a prominent scholar. Mr. Santos, above, in an executive order issued late Monday, said about 3,000 DAS employees would migrate to the attorney general&rsquo;s office, while the Interior Ministry, National Police and Foreign Ministry would absorb almost 2,000 other employees. A new intelligence agency is to be created.
