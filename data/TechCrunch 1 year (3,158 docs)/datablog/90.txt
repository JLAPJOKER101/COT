Jury selection is starting today for the patent trial between Apple and Samsung that has already resulted in the release of tons of early Apple iPhone and iPad prototypes designs. But one design holds particular interest: an iPhone concept called Purple. The phone isnt actually purple (its white), but the big news is not the color  its the date of the creation. To counter Samsungs charge that Apple copied Sonys smartphone and Walkman designs when it created the iPhone, Apple filed a motion with the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California which shows the Purple concept was from 2005  before Sonys Nishibori Design, developed in March 2006.Samsung had pulled Sonys designs into the case, as an effort to discredit Apple and show that it copied designs from elsewhere in the creation of the iPhone.News of the Purple concept was first reported by The Verge, which referred to documents from Apple which called the Sony-style touches an enjoyable side project, but one that was done on top of original concept designs. Apple then asked the court to exclude Samsungs evidence, showing that Apples designs were Sony-inspired.Apple requests that the Court enforce Judge Grewals Order by excluding evidence that Apples designs were derived from Sonys design language, from Mr. Nishiboris exercise in applying Sony-style design details to the iPhone, or from Sony handsets of the time. Because this evidence is not admissible to prove the invalidity of Apples patents, it should not come in for any purpose.Although Apple is not enjoying having to release so many of its prototype designs in such a public forum, revealing the Purple concept worked. According The Verges updated report, Judge Lucy Koh says now that Samsung will not be allowed to show evidence during the trial regarding the Sony-inspired designs for the iPhone.
