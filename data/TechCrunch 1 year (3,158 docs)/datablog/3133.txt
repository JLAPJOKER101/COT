If youve got $30 burning a hole in your pocket you can be the proud owner of a brand new HiPhone 5, a knock-off iPhone 5 modelled  we presume  on the leaked pictures of the iPhone 5. The phone, which features Wi-Fi, a micro SD slot, and a GSM cellular radio, is standard Shanzai material. It also requires a stylus to use the touchscreen and call quality, according to a buyer, is pretty bad.A typical buyer comment, Google translated:Phone looks good, is the reaction a little slow, but cheap for the Shanzai is so good, sometimes the touch screen with either hand, must use the stylus, there is the call quality is not very good, very big noise, playing music, they also have noise, because just received the goods, just one day, other effects do not knowLuckily this isnt a real Apple product so importers dont have to shoot the thing across a river using a crossbow. They just sell it on Taobao.Also not that our buddy Stagueve from NoWhereElses altered photo is currently the product photo for this magical product, proving that we bloggers are so ahead of the curve that were predicting the future.Product Page
