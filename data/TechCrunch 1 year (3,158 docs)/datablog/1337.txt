March Madness is about to start, and for many friends and co-workers, that means its betting time. This year, however, RRE Ventures-backed startup numberFire wants you to make those bets based on real data and math.The company just launched a new Facebook app called the March Radness Challenge. The problem, says CEO Nik Bonaddio, is that most people have no idea whos going to win each game in the basketball tournament. Thats where numberFire comes in, bringing what Bonaddio calls a MoneyBall-ish approach to sports: The data is there, so lets use math and the power of big data/distributed computing to unlock the secrets of whats actually going on, and then use that to understand what will happen next.The app allows you to create a March Madness pool, and it handles all the scoring. As youre filling out the bracket, it also displays a need help? link. If you click on it, youll see the numberFire projection for the game, as well as the analytics and data behind that projection. That way, youre not just betting based on instinct and sentiment. (Disclosure: I know pathetically little about March Madness, but TechCrunch writer Rip Empson assures me that the app is cool and crazy smaht.) (Yes, he said smaht in an email.)numberFire also partnered with StubHub to offer $50 gift cards as a prize to the biggest groups in the app, and with Thrillist for recommendations on where to watch the games. (Thrillist is also helping with marketing.) And if you pick every item correctly, youre eligible to win a $100,000 prize.
