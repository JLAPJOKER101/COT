The News of the World hired a detective to spy on two lawyers representing victims in the phone-hacking scandal and their families, Rupert Murdoch&rsquo;s British newspaper group confirmed Monday. The detective, Derek Webb, told the BBC he had been commissioned in 2010 to follow Mark Lewis and Charlotte Harris, lawyers who represented multiple clients who claimed that The News of the World, since closed, had illegally intercepted their voicemail.&nbsp; The BBC, citing internal newspaper documents, said the company hoped to prove that the lawyers were romantically involved, which could have forced them to decline further phone-hacking cases. News International, the British arm of Mr. Murdoch&rsquo;s newspaper chain, said in a statement that though the surveillance was not illegal, &ldquo;it was clearly deeply inappropriate in these circumstances,&rdquo; and that no current executive had condoned it. &nbsp;
