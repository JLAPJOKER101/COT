Rosen Plevneliev, who as regional development minister has been lauded for pushing through several large-scale infrastructure projects, was declared the winner of Bulgaria&rsquo;s presidential election on Monday, giving his party control over all major government posts and bolstering its push for painful economic reforms. Mr. Plevneliev won with 53 percent of the vote, according to the Central Election Commission, and his Socialist challenger, Ivailo Kalfin, conceded. Most power in the corruption-plagued country of 7.4 million people rests with the prime minister and Parliament, but the president leads the armed forces and can veto legislation and sign treaties. He also names ambassadors and the heads of the intelligence and security services. Mr. Plevneliev, 47, has pledged to reduce the deficit and pursue business-friendly policies.
