An official in Ivory Coast said 12 people, including the son of the country&rsquo;s former strongman, had been detained and charged over their actions during six months of postelection violence that left hundreds dead. Noel Dje, a spokesman of the Abidjan constable&rsquo;s office, said Wednesday that the detainees included Michel Gbagbo, the son of the former leader Laurent Gbagbo. Trial dates have not yet been set.        

The spokesman said that Laurent Gbagbo and his wife were also expected to be charged, but their case would be handled by the Ministry of the Interior. The elder Mr. Gbagbo&rsquo;s refusal to step down after his defeat in presidential elections in November set off the deadly violence. He was later captured and taken into custody by the man who won the election, Alassane Ouattara. Mr. Gbagbo was removed from office with the help of French and United Nations military strikes.
