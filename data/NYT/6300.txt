Greece was wrong to veto Macedonia&rsquo;s bid to join NATO in 2008 because of the two countries&rsquo; long-running dispute over the use of the name Macedonia, the International Court of Justice in The Hague ruled Monday. Greece has a province of Macedonia and, arguing that the name implies territorial ambitions, has blocked Macedonia&rsquo;s accession to NATO and to the European Union. The court ruled that Greece broke its international agreements in objecting to Macedonia&rsquo;s admission to NATO, but rejected a request from Macedonia that Greece be ordered not to repeat such conduct in the future.
