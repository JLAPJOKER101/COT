Facebooks IPO was obviously the single most discussed topic on Twitter today. The good folks over at social media data platform DataSift monitored what Twitter users were saying about the IPO throughout the day and came up with some interesting conclusions. Turns out, the ups and downs of how Twitters users felt about the stock pretty much mirrored the price of Facebooks stock as the day progressed.Basically, DataSift notes, every time the volume of negative chatter on Twitter increased, Facebooks stock price dropped within 20 minutes. So if people had traded based on signals today to buy/sell Facebook stock, the company told us,they might have done quite well.To create this graph, DataSift recorded 95,019 interactions from 58,665 authors over a period of 6 hours. Most interactions, of course, took place right during the early hours after Facebooks stock started trading (and took an immediate dive from $42 closer to $38). The company also saw a second and much smaller uptick in interactions toward the end of the day as well.For the most part, of course, this is just a fun exercise in tracking Twitter data. Its worth noting, though, that quite a few recent studies that looked into the connection between Twitter posts and stock prices found that there is at least a slight correlation between Twitter sentiment and volume and stock prices.You can find a bit more of DataSifts data, which also takes a closer look at the total volume of posts about the Facebook IPO, here.
