BEIJING &mdash; A former fugitive accused by the Chinese authorities of being responsible for one of the nation&rsquo;s biggest corruption scandals was indicted on Friday after he was said to confess to bribery and smuggling, according to state news organizations.        

The authorities have accused Lai Changxing of running a multibillion-dollar smuggling network out of Xiamen, in Fujian Province, in the 1990s and say he was connected to some of the top officials in China. The smuggling operation was the largest of its kind since the Communist Party took over China in 1949, the authorities said.        

Mr. Lai fled with his family and sought asylum in Canada in 1999 but was sent back to China in July after a Canadian court upheld a deportation order against him.        

Investigations into the smuggling, which involved Mr. Lai&rsquo;s company, the Yuanhua Group, have touched scores of officials. Jia Qinglin, now among China&rsquo;s top nine leaders, was the senior party leader in Fujian at the time.
