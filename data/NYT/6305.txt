CAIRO &mdash; Turnout plunged Monday as Egyptians in Cairo, Alexandria, and seven other governorates voted in runoffs to decide the initial round of the first parliamentary elections since the ouster of President Hosni Mubarak almost nine months ago. The lines at the polls were far shorter than when the voting began a week before, and at the same time, the Egyptian election commission said that the turnout last week was in fact much lower than initially reported.        

Fifty-two percent of eligible voters turned out last week, the commission said, explaining that it had made a mathematical error when it previously put turnout at 62 percent just a few days ago. Egyptian authorities had initially estimated turnout at 70 percent.        

The ruling military council has sought in state media to use the high turnout figures as evidence of its support for its legitimacy as custodian of the political transition.        

Because of an unexpectedly strong showing by Islamist parties in last week&rsquo;s vote, many of Monday&rsquo;s runoffs pit members of the Muslim Brotherhood, Egypt&rsquo;s mainstream Islamist group, against a faction of ultraconservatives known as Salafis. State media have reported that in the portion of last week&rsquo;s voting divided between party slates the Muslim Brotherhood&rsquo;s Freedom and Justice Party won nearly 40 percent, the largest Salafi party, Al Nour, won 25 percent, and a coalition of liberal parties known as the Egyptian Bloc won about 15 percent of the vote.        

Eighteen more governorates will vote in two more stages over the next few weeks, and turnout is unlikely to match the levels set in the flurry of attention about the first vote since Mr. Mubarak was forced from office.
