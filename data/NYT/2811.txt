The World Bank said Tuesday that it was willing to provide up to $6 billion to support political and economic change in Egypt and Tunisia to help them weather declines in tourism and other economic activity. The money is intended to seed a broader package of international support and allow Egyptians and Tunisians to &ldquo;seize the opportunities of historic change to modernize their economies and build more open and inclusive societies,&rdquo; said Robert B. Zoellick, the World Bank president. Both Egypt and Tunisia have been under economic strain since the revolutions in those countries, but the bank said political reforms often produce rebounds in economic activity. Egypt and Tunisia will seek additional help this week from the Group of 8 nations.
