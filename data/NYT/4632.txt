About 30 Pakistani boys remained hostages on Friday after men, suspected to be Taliban militants, kidnapped them by luring them across the border to Afghanistan, Pakistani officials said. The men initially seized around 40, but those under 12 were released and traveled back to their villages in the border region of Bajur. It was unclear why they were kidnapped.
