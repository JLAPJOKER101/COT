Wow, Microsoft just got exciting again! Were hearing (like everybody else) that the company is in serious talks to acquire enterprise social network and our 410 Townsend Street neighbor Yammer  for a reported $1 billion.Ive independently heard from another source that Salesforce was also in acquisition talks with Yammer, but at this point I think everyones just constantly talking to everyone about buying everyone so thats not surprising. But the Microsoft rumors are legit Im hearing, though its unclear if a deal has been reached (Bloomberg is reporting that might happen as soon as tomorrow).And as were all chattering about this at the TechCrunch office cooler, and yes, on Yammer, we get the following email telling us to head down to LA for a major Microsoft announcement. I cant recall Microsoft ever being so mysterious  Then again, it doesnt really have a history of announcing acquisitions like this (Skype was a press release, and that buy was billions of dollars).One interesting tidbit that gives the Yammer Acquisition Announcement theory more credence: Yammer CEO David Sacks is having his big Snoop Dogg/French 18th Century costume 40th birthday bash (I know) in LA this weekend. So. hes already down there.Update: Ina Fried is reporting that its actually about some tablet thing. God, so boring.Full press invite below.>> - Forwarded message -
