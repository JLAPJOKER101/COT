SEOUL, South Korea &mdash; The police on Friday detained nearly three dozen activists and villagers on Jeju Island who had set up a camp where they have resisted the construction of a naval base in their seashore village.        

Kim Sung-han, a police spokesman, said he could not confirm the number of protesters at the scene or the number of police officers involved in the raid in the village, Gangjeong, where the protest was taking place. Kim Moo-geun, an officer at a nearby police station, said 35 activists, Roman Catholic priests and villagers had been detained for questioning on charges that they had illegally obstructed the government project.        

After the arrests, a steel fence was built around the construction site to block villagers from entering. The base is expected to be home to 20 South Korean Navy warships. Villagers and activists from the South Korean mainland have been camping inside the construction area to block the work, saying that the base would ruin the environment and the villagers&rsquo; way of life.
