Remember when Google search ads used to be three lines of text? Nowadays, says Google in a new blog post, roughly one-third of searches with ads show an enhanced ad format (featuring video preview windows, prices, images, specific links on a given Web page, recommendations from your friends and whatnot).Or as Google puts it in the blog post: What started as three lines of simple text has evolved into ads that are multimedia-rich, location-aware and socially-amplified.The company will talk more about whats new with search ads tomorrow at Advertising Week in New York City, and according to Bloomberg will launch Web-based circulars that are similar to the ad inserts included in newspapers, thus making Google look more and more like the Sunday paper.If it were up to Google, advertisers would no longer opt for ads that only show three lines of text.Google has already gone live with a dedicated promotion website to tout enhanced search ads, and published a series of videos that should help advertisers understand what theyre all about.They also talk numbers, such as:- Every day there are more than a billion searches on Google.
