A group of mothers demanding justice for the victims of the Tiananmen Square massacre of June 4, 1989, said Tuesday that police officials in Beijing had contacted one family in April to discuss giving compensation for the death in that family. It was a rare instance in which officials had mentioned compensation in relation to the killings. However, the group said in a letter circulated on the Internet that the police officials did not talk about revealing the truth of the killings, legal redress or the possibility of addressing each case. Instead, &ldquo;they simply raised the issue of how much money should be given and stressed that this is for individuals, not the group as a whole,&rdquo; said the letter, which had 127 signatures. The group said: &ldquo;The bottom line is this: the souls of those killed during June 4 shall not be defiled; their families shall not be dishonored.&rdquo;
