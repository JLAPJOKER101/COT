Parliament elected Mariano Rajoy as Spain&rsquo;s new prime minister on Tuesday, and the country&rsquo;s borrowing costs plummeted in a debt auction, indicating renewed market confidence in its ability to handle its debt. Mr. Rajoy&rsquo;s Popular Party won an absolute majority in last month&rsquo;s parliamentary elections on promises to lift Spain out of its economic crisis. Spain has already sharply cut spending to convince bond investors that it will remain solvent despite the turmoil in European financial markets, and Mr. Rajoy has said he intends to pursue more austerity, including imposing a hiring freeze for most groups of civil servants.
