A Swedish man who was experimenting with radioactive materials at home said Wednesday that he had eventually realized his activities were illegal and sent a question about what he was doing to Sweden&rsquo;s Radiation Authority. The government answered by sending the police, who arrested him on charges of unauthorized possession of nuclear material. In explaining his actions on Wednesday, Richard Handl, 31, said that he had &ldquo;always been interested in physics and chemistry&rdquo; and wanted to &ldquo;see if it&rsquo;s possible to split atoms at home.&rdquo; If convicted, Mr. Handl could face fines or up to two years in prison. Although he says the police did not detect dangerous levels of radiation in his apartment, he now acknowledges that the project was not a good idea. The police have not commented on the case or indicated if they believe Mr. Handl&rsquo;s explanation of his actions.
