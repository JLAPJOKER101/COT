ROME &mdash; As markets continued to hammer Italy, Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi on Wednesday rebutted calls for his resignation, saying Italy&rsquo;s economic fundamentals were strong and pledging that his government was &ldquo;up to the task&rdquo; of fostering economic growth.        

&ldquo;The country is economically and financially solid. In difficult moments, it knows how to stay together and confront difficulties,&rdquo; Mr. Berlusconi said in his first public remarks in a tense month. &ldquo;Today more than ever, we need to act all together.&rdquo;        

But neither the center-left opposition nor financial markets shared Mr. Berlusconi&rsquo;s optimism or his confidence in his government&rsquo;s ability to carry out long-promised reforms. Rates on Italy&rsquo;s benchmark 10-year bond remained above 6 percent on Wednesday, easing only slightly from Tuesday&rsquo;s record highs.        

Addressing Parliament for the first time since it passed a $70 billion austerity package in mid-July, Mr. Berlusconi said he was confident the package would balance Italy&rsquo;s budget by 2014.        

In separate speeches to the Lower House and the Senate after the markets had closed, he offered no concrete proposals beyond calls for unity and saying he would meet with the opposition, as well as business and labor union leaders, to discuss a plan for growth. Mr. Berlusconi said that his government would serve its mandate until 2013, &ldquo;when we will serenely face the judgment of the electorate.&rdquo;        

Given the ferocity of the markets&rsquo; turn against Italy, analysts said the address fell short of what was needed.        

&ldquo;It was a speech without ideas,&rdquo; said Stefano Folli, the chief political columnist of the financial daily Il Sole 24 Ore, which is owned by the industrialists&rsquo; association, Confindustria. &ldquo;It was very optimistic. I had hoped for a tone more adequate to the difficulties of the moment.&rdquo;        

A born salesman whose peppy speeches once entranced Italians, Mr. Berlusconi recently has often seemed more consumed with his own personal legal problems and the fate of his businesses &mdash; which include Italy&rsquo;s largest private broadcaster &mdash; than with the fate of his country.        

On Wednesday, Mr. Berlusconi was met with boos in the Lower House when he said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re listening to a businessman who has three businesses listed on the stock market and who is in the financial trenches, aware every day of what&rsquo;s going on in the markets.&rdquo;        

At his side in the Lower House was his finance minister, Giulio Tremonti, who has been weakened by a corruption investigation into a former aide.        

After the speech, Pier Luigi Bersani of the center-left Democratic Party renewed his calls for Mr. Berlusconi to step down and call early elections, as his Spanish counterpart, Jos&eacute; Luis Rodr&iacute;guez Zapatero, did last week.        

&ldquo;Italy is in very big trouble,&rdquo; Mr. Bersani said. &ldquo;We have been told we&rsquo;re better than the others. We haven&rsquo;t looked this problem in the face,&rdquo; he added, referring to Mr. Berlusconi&rsquo;s remarks that Italy&rsquo;s budget deficit, 4.6 percent of the gross domestic product in 2010, is below the European average, although its debt, at nearly 120 percent of gross domestic product, is Europe&rsquo;s highest after Greece. Italy&rsquo;s growth rate is hovering at a paltry 1 percent.        

&ldquo;The question of how can we pay our debt if we don&rsquo;t even grow, is a legitimate question,&rdquo; Mr. Bersani said.        

The spike in Italy&rsquo;s borrowing rates came weeks after the Italian Parliament passed austerity measures &mdash; mostly increasing taxes and cutting planned spending increases &mdash; which go into effect in 2013-14, after this legislature is out of office.        

If Italy&rsquo;s borrowing costs continue to rise, however, the country could quickly confront a solvency crisis, like Greece, Ireland and Portugal before it. In September, $87 billion in government bonds are scheduled to come due, and the country is expected to issue around $44 billion more, the Finance Ministry said.        

On Thursday, Mr. Berlusconi is expected to meet with business and labor union leaders for trilateral talks. In a rare joint statement last week, business and labor leaders called for a &ldquo;pact for growth,&rdquo; adding that &ldquo;the market does not seem to recognize the solidity of Italy&rsquo;s economic fundamentals.&rdquo;        

Though shielded by a fatalistic resignation, ordinary Italians are increasingly upset at politicians who keep their privileges while imposing austerity on voters.        

&ldquo;Nothing ever changes in this country,&rdquo; said Rossella Massi, 51, a manager at a shoe store in Rome. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve voted for the right, the center and the left, but whoever sits on those chairs just protects their own interests.&rdquo;        

&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had a crisis looming for many years, this is nothing new to me, basically since they introduced the euro,&rdquo; Ms. Massi added. &ldquo;With the lira, I ate. With the euro, I struggle to survive.&rdquo;
