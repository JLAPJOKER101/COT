An administrative court canceled the construction permit on Thursday for the Grand Mosque of Marseille, which is expected to be one of the largest mosques in France, French newspapers reported. The judges cited &ldquo;enduring uncertainties&rdquo; on whether the $31 million project met urban planning requirements, including for the construction of a 450-place parking lot, the newspaper Le Figaro reported. The construction, which was due to start in February, had already been suspended for 18 months after complaints from residents and members of far-right movements who consider the building too large. To proceed, the mosque will have to apply for a new permit.
