Four United States missile strikes in northwestern Pakistan in less than 24 hours killed at least 42 people, Pakistani intelligence officials said Tuesday. The attacks indicate the White House has no intention of stopping its drone program even though the attacks have caused tension with Pakistan. The United States refuses to publicly acknowledge the drone attacks, but officials have said privately that the strikes have killed senior officials for the Taliban and Al Qaeda.
