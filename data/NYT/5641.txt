Lawyers for a terrorism suspect being held at Guant&aacute;namo Bay filed a case against Lithuania on Thursday at the European Court of Human Rights over torture and secret detention at a C.I.A.-run site in Lithuania. The suspect, Abu Zubaydah, was taken from Morocco to Lithuania in February 2005, rights organizations say. The London-based rights group Interights said he &ldquo;was held in a secret detention facility, constructed and equipped specifically for C.I.A. detention, in accordance with prior authorization from high level Lithuanian authorities.&rdquo; Lithuanian prosecutors said last week that they would not reopen an investigation despite new information on the case provided by the rights groups.
