Mobile analytics firm Mobilewalla has ranked the top apps across all four mobile platforms for 2011, using its own ranking system known at the Mobilewalla Score. Instead of looking at raw user ratings, this scoring system is an algorithm that analyzes a variety of factors in addition to ratings, including an apps position within its own category, volume, social media sentiment and more.The scores are a numerical value between 0 and 100, with a higher score indicating a more successful app. Its an interesting way to slice the data, and gives a different picture of the app store ecosystem than typical year-end lists do. Those often look solely at download numbers and tend to include apps which have been popular for years  like Facebook, Twitter, Angry Birds, etc. Other lists, meanwhile, are editorially selected or curated, like some of those weve featured here.The list below is grouped by platform (Android, iOS, BlackBerry, Windows Phone): Pixlr-o-matic (Android Free): 97.5 out of 100Super Stickman Golf: (Android Free): 97.5 out of 100Smurfs Village (Android Free): 97 out of 100Crime Story (Android Free): 96.4 out of 100Marvel Comics (Android Free): 96.3 out of 100MADDEN NFL 12 by EA SPORTS™ (Android Paid): 93.6 out of 100Dragon, Fly!
