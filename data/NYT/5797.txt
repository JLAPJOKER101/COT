WASHINGTON (AP) &mdash; The top United States military commander in Afghanistan has fired a senior officer for making inappropriate public remarks about President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan and his government.        

Gen. John R. Allen, the commander of NATO forces in Afghanistan, issued a statement on Friday saying that Maj. Gen. Peter Fuller had been relieved of his duties as the deputy commander for the Afghan training mission.        

In a recent interview with the Web site Politico, General Fuller described Afghan leaders as erratic, ungrateful and isolated from reality. He was reported to have said in the interview that Afghan leaders did not fully recognize the sacrifices of the United States on their country&rsquo;s behalf.        

Referring to Mr. Karzai&rsquo;s recent assertion that Afghanistan would side with Pakistan if Pakistan got involved in a war with the United States, General Fuller was quoted as calling the comments &ldquo;erratic.&rdquo;        

&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you just poke me in the eye with a needle!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to be kidding me. I&rsquo;m sorry, we just gave you $11.6 billion and now you&rsquo;re telling me, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t really care?&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;        

General Fuller also called the Afghans &ldquo;isolated from reality&rdquo; and said the country&rsquo;s leaders did not understand the extent of the economic distress in the United States or the &ldquo;sacrifices that America is making to provide for their security.&rdquo; General Allen said the comments were &ldquo;unfortunate&rdquo; and said they did not represent the solid relationship between the United States and the Afghan government.        

&ldquo;The Afghan people are an honorable people, and comments such as these will not keep us from accomplishing our most critical and shared mission &mdash; bringing about a stable, peaceful and prosperous Afghanistan,&rdquo; he said.        

There was no indication whether General Fuller would be reassigned or if he would retire.
