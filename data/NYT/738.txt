The Palestinian Authority announced on Tuesday that it would hold delayed local elections on July 9. The vote was originally scheduled for last summer, but it was postponed by disagreements over candidates within the Fatah movement. In December, a Palestinian court ordered the authority to go ahead with the elections, and the quick decision is widely attributed to the democratic momentum created by the uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt. Elections were supposed to be held in both the West Bank and Gaza, but Hamas, which rules in Gaza, has said it would not allow them to take place. No election has been held in either territory since 2006.
