Argentina&rsquo;s last military president has been found guilty of more crimes against humanity, this time getting 15 years for setting up a secret torture center inside a hospital during the 1976 military coup. The leader, Reynaldo Benito Bignone, oversaw the takeover of the Posadas de Haedo hospital in provincial Buenos Aires 35 years ago. Dozens of people were kidnapped, and doctors and nurses were among the torture victims. General Bignone, 85, was previously sentenced to 25 years in prison for involvement in illegal raids, kidnapping and torture involving 56 people from 1976 to 1978 at the Campo de Mayo detention centers at a military base on the outskirts of Buenos Aires.
