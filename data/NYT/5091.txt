Two days after King Abdullah granted women the right to vote and run for public office, starting in 2015, a court on Tuesday sentenced a woman to 10 lashes for violating religious rules prohibiting women in the kingdom from driving, activists and local news media said. The woman, Shaimaa Ghassaneya, was found guilty of driving in Jidda in July. Her sentence was unusually severe for the crime, which typically results in several days of detention. Activists said she planned to appeal. More women have been encouraged to violate the driving ban in recent months, as part of the social media-driven Women2Drive campaign. At least two more were expected to stand trial in the coming months.
