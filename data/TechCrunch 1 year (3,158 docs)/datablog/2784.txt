TechCrunch founder Michael Arrington, who recently left the company he founded over six years ago, is back in action. Or at least, he has proven that he still knows how to set up a WordPress blog.Arrington just tweeted a link to Uncrunched, which will be his personal blog from here on out. There isnt really much there yet, save for his first post titled, Here I Am. Thats it — the post consists of just the title — but presumably his later posts will be a little more content-heavy (fingers crossed that this new role as General Partner at CrunchFund is just a ploy to unearth all of Silicon Valleys dark secrets).Which brings us to the comments.Arrington has apparently decided to use the basic WordPress commenting system. Its a brave move (you may remember the TechCrunch comments of yore), but the trolls havent overwhelmed the blog just yet.In keeping with time-honored Internet tradition, the first comment on the blog is omg. first. — congratulations to former TC developer and Cake Health cofounder Andy Brett for claiming the top spot. And an A for effort to Philip Kaplan, who wrote first despite being the blogs twelfth comment. The remainder of the comments are generally positive, though there are a few outliers, like the one embedded below.Disclosure: Arrington was my boss for a long time and I ate a lot of his cereal when TC was still based out of his house.
