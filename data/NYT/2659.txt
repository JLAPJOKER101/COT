Peru&rsquo;s presidential front-runner, Keiko Fujimori, has hired former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York as an adviser, trying to bolster her law-and-order credentials and distance herself from her father, former President Alberto Fujimori, who is in prison. Ms. Fujimori said Mr. Giuliani would help her design public safety programs. After vigorously defending her father for years, Ms. Fujimori apologized last month for what she called the excesses of his authoritarian rule. Pollsters say those comments have helped her move slightly ahead of the left-wing candidate Ollanta Humala. The election is June 5.
