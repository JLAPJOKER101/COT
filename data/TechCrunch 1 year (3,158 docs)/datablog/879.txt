Youve heard of GroundLink before. They offer ground transportation with up-front before-you-ride pricing throughout the U.S., and like Uber, you can book everything from your phone.The service basically puts all the control in the hands of the customer. You can book a reservation way in advance, or on-demand if youre in NYC. Plus, you can choose what type of car you want, including hybrid/green vehicles, and watch the driver on a map as your ride approaches.But today, GroundLink is tackling its greatest obstacle yet: Los Angeles traffic. The company is now offering on-demand ground transportation in the most traffic-ridden city in the country.When I asked CEO Charles Fraas why the company wanted to delve into LA his answer was bold, and two-fold:First of all, its the second largest ground transportation market in the U.S. Second to that, its one of the biggest challenges for us. Its a market with the most challenging ground transportation, the nastiest traffic, and most difficult place to get from point A to point B. We can solve this problem, and were ready to show it off.Its a confident response, to say the least, but GroundLink is a confident company overall. They guarantee on-time service, and if theyre more than five minutes late picking you up, your next ride is free.They can make such promises thanks to the recent acquisition of a company called Limo Anywhere. Limo Anywhere tech allows GroundLink to track all vehicle availability in real-time in the area, within a network of 45,000 transportation providers. This is the largest network of ground transportation in the world, and 4,000 of those cars are chilling in LA.The long-term plan is to offer the same on-demand car services coming to LA (and already in NY) nationwide over the coming months.This slideshow requires JavaScript.
