Three American Navy ships were welcomed Friday by Vietnam for joint training, despite objections from China. United States and Vietnamese officials have stressed that the seven-day ship visit and training are part of routine exchanges planned long before tensions began flaring between China and Vietnam over disputed areas of the South China Sea in May. China has criticized the port call as inappropriate, saying it should have been rescheduled. Rear Adm. Tom Carney, who is leading the naval exchange, said the United States would &ldquo;maintain a presence in the Western Pacific and the South China Sea as we have for decades, and we have no intention of departing from that kind of activity.&rdquo;
