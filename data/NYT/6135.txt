Gunmen burst into a restaurant in Timbuktu on Friday, grabbed four tourists and executed one when he refused to climb into their truck, according to a witness and an official who inspected the body. The armed men entered the Amanar restaurant and pointed their guns at four tourists dining inside, said Moussa Boubacar, a client at the restaurant. When the gunmen tried to make them enter a vehicle, one of the tourists refused, Mr. Boubacar said, and the kidnappers opened fire. The victims&rsquo; nationalities could not immediately be confirmed, but witnesses described them as European.
