A Saudi lawyer and human rights advocates said that the authorities would bring a Saudi activist to trial for defying the kingdom&rsquo;s ban on women driving. The lawyer, Waleed Aboul Khair, said that the activist, Najalaa Harrir, had been summoned for questioning by the prosecutor general in the city of Jidda on Sunday, the same day that King Abdullah said women would be permitted to vote and to run in local elections in four years.
