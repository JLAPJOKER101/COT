The search for seven Americans whose boat capsized in the Gulf of California continued on Tuesday, with rescuers saying the tourists might still be alive after more than two days in the warm, calm waters. Nineteen of the tourists and all 16 crew members were picked up by the Mexican Navy or other fishing boats after clinging to coolers, rescue rings and life vests for more than 16 hours.
