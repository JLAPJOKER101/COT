Jonathans Starbucks card lives in Jonathan Starks wallet. You can download a copy of the card (shown here) and, when there is money on it, scan it at any Starbucks to buy coffee and, as far as anyone can tell, Jonathan doesnt care. Crazy, you say? Sure, its crazy like a fox.Jonathan Stark is a programmer and writer and has been experimenting with social sharing of physical goods using digital currency on mobile phones. Similar to the old Italian tradition of Caffe Pagato, Jonathan wants you to use the cash on his card to buy your own coffee. He also wants you to tweet about your experience and, if youre really cool, put a little money on the card. He has written an API to access the current card balance and he has a Tweetstream that tweets out current numebrs. As of this writing there is about $180 (UPDATE: Someone grabbed $150 off the card just now) on the card so you can probably hit a the cafe today on Jonathans dime. Want to help the cause?

Sadly, I suspect the card will soon be tapped and, barring regular infusions, greed will win the day. I also wonder how long it will take before Starbucks shuts this down because of ummm because it undermines um because its anarchistic?You can grab your copy of the card here. Happy sipping.
