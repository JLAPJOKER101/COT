WASHINGTON (AP) &mdash; The Justice Department said that ArmorGroup North America Inc. and its affiliates have paid $7.5 million to settle accusations that they filed false claims on a contract to guard the United States Embassy in Kabul, Afghanistan.        

The State Department said that the company&rsquo;s guards visited brothels in Kabul, that ArmorGroup North America&rsquo;s management knew about the guards&rsquo; conduct and that the company misrepresented the work experience of 38 guards at the embassy. The brothel visits violated the federal Trafficking Victims Protection Act, according to the government.        

The settlement also covered claims that ArmorGroup North America failed to live up to requirements that it insulate itself from control by a foreign owner on the embassy contract and on a contract for guard services at a Navy base in Bahrain.
