Some 1,000 Tunisians have fled the chaos in their homeland and arrived by boat on a tiny Italian island, prompting Italy to demand Friday that the European Union take stronger action to prevent an uncontrolled wave of migrants from North Africa. Since Jan. 16, about 1,600 Tunisians have landed in Italy, the United Nations refugee agency says, mostly on the island of Lampedusa. Interior Minister Roberto Maroni said he feared there were terrorists among those who escaped Tunisian prisons and fled during a month of antigovernment protests.
