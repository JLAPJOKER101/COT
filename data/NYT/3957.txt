Mexican soldiers have found a series of marijuana fields covering 148 acres in Durango State, the army said on Monday. An army patrol also found 44 tons of harvested marijuana as well as a processing lab and five camps, apparently for workers or guards. Together, the planted and harvested crops are worth about $133 million, the authorities said. Two weeks ago, soldiers found what the army described as the biggest marijuana plantation ever seen in Mexico, a 300-acre field in Baja California.
