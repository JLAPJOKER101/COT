The prosecutor of the International Criminal Court in The Hague said Tuesday that enforcing the newly issued arrest warrants for Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, one of his sons and his intelligence chief was mainly the responsibility of Libya because the war crimes investigation that led to the warrants had been ordered by a resolution of the United Nations Security Council. The prosecutor, Luis Moreno-Ocampo, said at a news conference that two Libyan rebel leaders were in The Hague for talks with his office about their plans, and that arrests could be just months away.
