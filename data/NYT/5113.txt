A Brazilian judge has suspended work on a massive hydroelectric dam in the Amazon jungle, saying it would harm fishing on the Xingu River. Brazil&rsquo;s government strongly backs the project, which when completed would make the dam the world&rsquo;s third-largest hydroelectric energy producer, and said it planned to appeal. In a ruling posted Thursday, the judge, Carlos Eduardo Martins, said he halted construction of the controversial Belo Monte dam because it would harm fishing by indigenous communities in Par&aacute; State. Work on the dam had been ordered halted by another judge in February, but that ruling was overturned.
