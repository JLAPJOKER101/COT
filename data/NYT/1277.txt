A court on Tuesday further delayed charging Raymond A. Davis, a C.I.A. operative who shot two people to death in Lahore. The next hearing will be held March 16, according to a prosecutor. On Jan. 27, in what Mr. Davis claims was self-defense, he shot and killed two motorcyclists at a busy intersection. The United States described the episode as an attempted robbery.
