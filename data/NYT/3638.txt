An international commission set up to study the June 2009 Honduran coup concluded that both former President Manuel Zelaya as well as the political leaders and military officers who overthrew him share blame for how the crisis unfolded. The panel&rsquo;s report, released in Tegucigalpa on Thursday, rejected the assertion by much of the country&rsquo;s political elite that Mr. Zelaya&rsquo;s overthrow was legal and said instead it met every definition of a coup. But Eduardo Stein, who led the commission, said it had also found that Mr. Zelaya had violated laws as he pressed ahead with plans to hold a referendum on whether to revise the constitution. Opponents said Mr. Zelaya had hoped to win changes that would allow his re-election.
