Iran&rsquo;s proposal for a diplomatic tour of its nuclear sites floundered on Thursday after China effectively rejected the invitation and Russia said such a trip could never replace United Nations inspections or negotiations with world powers. The European Union had turned down Iran&rsquo;s offer to allow selected ambassadors accredited to the United Nations nuclear watchdog agency to visit two nuclear installations this weekend. The United States was not invited. China said it would be &ldquo;difficult&rdquo; for its ambassador to attend because its representative was &ldquo;still in China right now.&rdquo; Russia&rsquo;s foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, said such a visit could never replace regular United Nations inspections or talks. Ali Asghar Soltanieh, Iran&rsquo;s nuclear envoy, said that ambassadors from Egypt, Cuba, Venezuela and Syria had accepted the invitation and that the tour would go ahead.
