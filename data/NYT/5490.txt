Swiss customs officials announced that they had intercepted a man at a Zurich airport whose luggage contained hundreds of a type of spider that is endangered. Customs officials found 261 of the Mexican red-kneed tarantulas packed into individual plastic bags inside six boxes belonging to a Swiss man arriving from the Dominican Republic in August. Officials said Wednesday that the shipment had been destined for an unidentified Swiss dealer. A search of the dealer&rsquo;s home uncovered 665 tarantulas and 72 giant flesh-eating centipedes that had also been smuggled into Switzerland. Together they could have sold for up to $16,700.
