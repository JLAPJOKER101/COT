The tech scene in NY is growing at such a rapid pace it kind of blows my mind. New York Tech Day was a glowing example of that growth, with 160 startups pitching and over 3,500 attendees.We couldnt help but attend ourselves, and what we saw was more than exciting. Whether it be an equally creepy and creative online dating service or a way to customize your own chocolate bar, theres no doubt that NYC is blossoming with technological creativity. We took a tour around the room, asking startups to justify their existence in 20 seconds. Of course, some were too tantalizing to cut off at the 20-second mark, but generally speaking we saw some pretty impressive pitches. Enjoy!
