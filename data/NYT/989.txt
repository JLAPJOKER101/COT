Nearly 25 years after Prime Minister Olof Palme was assassinated on his way home from a movie theater in Stockholm, the case remains unsolved, authorities said. Prosecutor Kerstin Skarp said Monday that the police had no suspects or any &ldquo;hot lead.&rdquo; The only man tried for the murder was acquitted on appeal after police failed to produce any technical evidence against him. Meanwhile, about 130 people have confessed to the killing, admissions the police have dismissed.
