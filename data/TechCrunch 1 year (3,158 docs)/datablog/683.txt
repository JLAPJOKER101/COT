When youre stuck for three days in a big warehouse with the same group of smart people talking about the future of tech innovation over and over and over again (+beer), you start getting really silly. And some of the unique circumstances of years TechCrunch Disrupt New York have given us plenty to be silly about.For instance, there are birds, live birds (!) in the conference hall, and in fact I can hear them right now chirping LOUDLY while one of the demo companies presents onstage. The birds are so prevalent that theyve spawned jokes from some of the speakers, like, Its so hip of you guys to hold a conference in a bird sanctuary in addition to a fake Twitter account, @TechCrunchBird, which tweets stuff like, *Frightened fluttering from music,* Disappointed chirp., *quiet listening*, and my personal favorite, 啁啾 ‪(Chirp in Chinese).Along with the CrunchBird, weve got the Josh Constine Asking The Hard Hitting Questions meme, inspired by the fact that Constine, one of our newest writers, GRILLED CEO Tim Armstrong hard on his fumbled moves with TechCrunch and Aols other content properties. Because the image of floppy-haired Josh taking down the high-powered Aol exec was so hilarious, we thought about some other situations in history where Joshs mad interviewing skills and unerring, bloodthirsty quest for the truth could have come in handy.The sight of TechCrunch editor John Biggs riding around Startup Alley on a motorized beer cooler was so ridiculous that we turned into an equally ridiculous gif. And yes, you could pretty much watch this forever and never be sick of it.You know what else we will probably never be sick of? Putting MC Hammer on stage, and this year we got him up there twice as a Startup Battlefield judge (because of confusion he showed up late), resulting in a slew of Judge Hammer Presides jokes.The Hammer caption contest winner? Well You have to ask yourself  how legit am I, in regard to my not quitting? definitely has my vote.And speaking of hammered, heres a random picture of our head developer Vineet Thanedar getting drunk on Churchkey beer at 10am.See you at Disrupt SF!
