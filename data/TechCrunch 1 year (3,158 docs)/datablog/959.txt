It seems like everyones worried about an incubator bubble, but seriously — Lemnos Labs is doing something different. Its not just incubating the latest social network or iPhone app. Instead, its looking for startups that actually build stuff, and by stuff, I mean hardware.At first, hardware and incubators sound like an odd match, since the incubator boom is driven, at least in part, by the way the Web has driven down the costs of starting a company. Hardware, on the other hand, sounds expensive and not resistant to the rapid iteration that thats now part of startup doctrine. However, Lemnos co-founder Jeremy Conrad says that thanks to developments like rapid prototyping, its becoming faster and cheaper to build a hardware startup too.Lemnos Labs is based in San Franciscos South of Market district, just about a block from the TechCrunch office. Its first batch of startups is only partway through the program, but the incubator is already accepting applications for the second class. Startups receive a spot in the Lemnos warehouse, access to prototyping facilities, $50,000 in funding, mentorship, and more.The inaugural class covers a pretty broad range:Interested startups can apply here. The deadline is May 11.
