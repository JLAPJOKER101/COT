The bodies of two Guatemalan men who disappeared in 1984 have been found at a former military base and identified through DNA testing, validating an exhumation process tied to the roughly 40,000 people who disappeared during Guatemala&rsquo;s civil war. The two men, Amancio Samuel Villatoro, a union leader, and Sergio Sa&uacute;l Linares Morales, an engineering professor, were captured by security forces. Experts said the discovery of the two bodies could lead to new investigations.
