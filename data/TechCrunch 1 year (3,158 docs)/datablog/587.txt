As of todays launch Airtime is a one-on-one video chat network, but what about tomorrow? Co-founders Sean Parker and Shawn Fanning tell us itd be pretty cool if Airtime became an app platform. The former Napster founders wouldnt rule out the possibility of photo-sharing on Airtime either.During the star-studded launch party we also got the stunning Olivia Munn, former host of Attack Of The Show, talking about whether Airtimes just for geeks, or if your grandmas going to get on board.Munn, whos featured in Aaron Sorkins new HBO drama The Newsroom, said she sees Airtime having serious mainstream appeal. Her mom doesnt quite get Skype, but Airtime is easier since theres nothing to download. I think I made her a little uncomfortable asking about whether people would have fully-consenting cybersex on Airtime, but she did describe the founders as loving guys.One thing Parker and Fanning dont have love for is retreading old problems. While they hinted that any type of stored content might one day be sharable on Airtime, we shouldnt expect it to become some real-time Instagram. Parker concluded:It seems like the right thing to do is tackle problems other people arent working on. Part of the challenge of being an entrepreneur, if youre going for a really huge opportunity, is trying to find problems that arent quite on the radar yet and try to solve those.For more on Airtime, check out our coverage:Face To Face: How Airtime Will Re-Humanize The Internet
