ShoeDazzle CEO Bill Strauss said in an interview (embedded above) that the expansion was inspired by the companys subscribers, who have been asking for clothing to match ShoeDazzles shoes for months. ShoeDazzle, based in Santa Monica, Calif., was founded in 2009 and counts reality star Kim Kardashian as a co-founder and its chief fashion stylist.The company has also tweaked its business model to let people buy items as often as they like, rather than on a once-per-month subscription basis.ShoeDazzle has had robust growth recently, Strauss said, with its member base expanding from 3 million to 10 million within the past 12 months. Now that its offerings go beyond shoes, the company is considering a name change, but has not made a final decision as of yet. ShoeDazzle has raised some $60 million in venture capital funding and is not looking to raise more money at the moment, Strauss said.Watch the video above to see Strauss discuss the expansion to clothing, how ShoeDazzle stacks up against competitors such as Beachmint, how ShoeDazzle designs and commissions its own products in-house, and why fashion and technology are really coming together right now.
