The Japanese police have arrested a 19-year-old on suspicion of cheating on an entrance exam at Kyoto University by posting test questions online with his cellphone to get outside help. The police said they arrested the student on Thursday on the suspicion that he obstructed business through fraudulence. If convicted, he could face up to three years in prison or a fine of $6,000. The Japanese media said Friday that he could become the first person to be prosecuted in Japan for cheating. His name was withheld because he is a minor under Japanese law.
