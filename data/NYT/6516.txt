President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono has ordered an investigation into the videotaped beheadings of two men, said to have been killed by security forces hired to protect a palm oil plantation. Six suspects &mdash; five plantation workers and a farmer &mdash; have already been arrested on suspicion of a role in the deaths, a national police spokesman said Friday. Eight other suspects are at large. Farmers said security forces and other men hired by a palm oil company to protect disputed land in South Sumatra Province had killed at least 30 people since 2009.
