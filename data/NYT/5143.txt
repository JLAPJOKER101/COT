The United States told Pakistan on Friday that it would not send ground troops to attack militants in North Waziristan. A senior American official said that Pakistan was assured &ldquo;there will be no boots on the ground.&rdquo; Also on Friday, President Obama backed off a statement by the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. Mike Mullen, that the militant Haqqani network was a &ldquo;veritable arm&rdquo; of the Pakistani spy service. &ldquo;The intelligence is not as clear as we might like in terms of what exactly that relationship is,&rdquo; Mr. Obama said in a radio interview. He added that whether Pakistan&rsquo;s support for the group was active or passive, &ldquo;they&rsquo;ve got to take care of this problem.&rdquo;
