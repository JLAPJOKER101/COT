An activist said Friday that he would end his four-day hunger strike after the government agreed to set up a committee to draft a stringent new anticorruption law. The hunger striker, Anna Hazare, has been fasting in a New Delhi park since Tuesday, drawing thousands of supporters, including movie stars and government officials. Kapil Sibal, a federal minister, said that the government would appoint a committee to draft a new law by June 30. Mr. Hazare, 73, said he would end his fast on Saturday, adding, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a victory for the people of India.&rdquo;
