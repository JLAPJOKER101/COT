Three-quarters of those arrested in Britain&rsquo;s riots last month had criminal records, Mayor Boris Johnson of London told a parliamentary committee on Tuesday. In the four days of rioting, ignited by a fatal police shooting in North London, five people were killed and stores were looted and buildings burned in several cities. The Ministry of Justice has said that more than 1,500 people were arrested and have appeared in court. Mr. Johnson said that three in four had criminal records and that the government must address the problem of recidivism.
