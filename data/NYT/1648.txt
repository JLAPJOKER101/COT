The central government in Beijing is tightening budgets for &ldquo;overseas junkets, receptions and cars to fight against extravagance in 2011,&rdquo; according to a report by Xinhua, the state news agency. The report indicated that government corruption continued to be a major concern among Chinese, and that some in the central government realize the ubiquitous image of corrupt officialdom is eroding the confidence of Chinese people. Xinhua, citing a meeting on Wednesday of the State Council, the Chinese cabinet, said that the central government would report the final budget for those expenses to the National People&rsquo;s Congress, a rubber-stamp legislature, and make the accounting available for public scrutiny. Xinhua cited one official saying a crackdown on extravagant spending had saved the nation nearly $900 million last year. It is unclear whether such crackdowns have really had any significant impact on corruption and waste.
