Tristane Banon, 31, a journalist and writer who has publicly claimed that Dominique Strauss-Kahn tried to rape her during an interview in 2002, now plans to file the legal complaint against him that she had decided against nine years ago, her lawyer, David Koubbi, said Monday.        

Her mother, Anne Mansouret, a Socialist Party official, persuaded her at the time not to file suit against a man who was close to her family and to their politics, Ms. Mansouret conceded in a television interview on Monday.        

Suggesting that she probably was in error, Ms. Mansouret recounted the conversation this way: &ldquo;Listen, you know, if he had raped you, I wouldn&rsquo;t have any hesitation, but that wasn&rsquo;t the case. He sexually assaulted you, there wasn&rsquo;t any rape per se; so until the end of your life, you&rsquo;re going to have on your r&eacute;sum&eacute;, you know, Tristane Banon is the girl who ... &rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;        

Ms. Banon talked about the alleged assault in a television interview in 2007, saying that a politician &mdash; whom she later identified as Mr. Strauss-Kahn &mdash; had tried to rape her when she went to interview him for a book. She said she contacted a lawyer but never filed a complaint because &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t wish to be the girl who had a problem with a politician for the rest of my life.&rdquo;
