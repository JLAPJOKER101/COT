PARIS        

ALAIN JUPP&Eacute;, resurrected in politics after a criminal conviction in 2004 for political chicanery, is the quiet, strong center of President Nicolas Sarkozy&rsquo;s effort to secure re-election in France next year.        

Mr. Jupp&eacute;, 66, France&rsquo;s foreign minister, is serious, competent, polite, intelligent and slightly dull &mdash; just the kind of &ldquo;homme s&eacute;rieux&rdquo; that voters suspect Mr. Sarkozy, with all his impatient flash, is not.        

Having been foreign minister from 1993 to 1995, and then prime minister, Mr. Jupp&eacute; was brought back to the Quai d&rsquo;Orsay in February this year to restore calm, order and credibility to a ministry shaken by the sudden and humiliating fall of Mich&egrave;le Alliot-Marie. She not only failed to see the revolution in Tunisia coming, but she also vacationed there with her parents during antigovernment demonstrations as the guests of an intimate of the old leadership.        

Like the equally serious prime minister, Fran&ccedil;ois Fillon, Mr. Jupp&eacute; is considered to be a safe pair of hands, and a constraint on the impetuous Mr. Sarkozy, both to rein him in and find ways to make his better ideas function as policy.        

The new relationship did not begin well. Mr. Sarkozy, eager to get on the right side of the Arab Spring, set off on a path toward early recognition of the Libyan rebels and military support for them without consulting his new foreign minister.        

An old friend of Mr. Sarkozy&rsquo;s, the public intellectual Bernard-Henri L&eacute;vy, brought key Libyans to see Mr. Sarkozy in early March. Mr. Sarkozy reportedly joked that to conduct airstrikes, it would be necessary &ldquo;to step over the body of Jupp&eacute;.&rdquo; Mr. Jupp&eacute; denies having been taken by surprise, but he reportedly threatened to quit unless Mr. Sarkozy stopped behaving unilaterally.        

But it was Mr. Jupp&eacute;&rsquo;s ministry that was instrumental in the successful diplomacy around the war, at the United Nations, in NATO and with the Libyan contact group. Mr. Sarkozy has gone out of his way to praise Mr. Jupp&eacute;, &ldquo;his solidity and competence,&rdquo; &ldquo;his organizational qualities&rdquo; and his &ldquo;perfect knowledge&rdquo; of diplomatic practice.        

The Libyan war had its problems, including shortages of ammunition and fighter planes, and the participation in the fighting of only 8 of NATO&rsquo;s 28 members. Still, as Mr. Jupp&eacute; said with a rare smile in a recent interview aboard his official plane, &ldquo;it was rather a good thing for NATO, simply because it succeeded.&rdquo;        

The Libyan war underlined for him the need for a better European capacity to fight, including military planning, separately from NATO. There may be other Libyas, when Washington does not want to lead and some NATO countries do not want to participate, he said. That Gaullist position leaves Britain and the United States cold, but it was Washington&rsquo;s reticence that revived it.        

Libya was also important for France&rsquo;s self-confidence in a changing world, Mr. Jupp&eacute; said, and for Mr. Sarkozy&rsquo;s own image, carefully nurtured, of a man who wants France to play a global role and is at his best in a crisis.        

&ldquo;The French are very bizarre,&rdquo; Mr. Jupp&eacute; said. &ldquo;There is this collective depiction: &lsquo;We&rsquo;re in decline, we&rsquo;re being assailed, we must protect ourselves.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; Individually, though, when asked about their personal lives, he said, &ldquo;they are extremely positive.&rdquo;        

&ldquo;I believe that this country still has a formidable potential,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s simply necessary to restore confidence, to show that there are efforts that must be made, but we still have a place, which is perhaps not the same as before, but we have a role to play. And I believe that what Sarkozy has done with his diplomacy in the Arab world with Libya, even if it has not completely changed the opinion polls, this really is restoring confidence to the French.&rdquo;        

The contrast between Mr. Sarkozy and Mr. Jupp&eacute; can seem so vivid that Le Monde recently and mischievously used a headline describing them as &ldquo;Doctor Jupp&eacute; et Mister Sarkozy,&rdquo; a play on Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.        

Foreign policy since De Gaulle has always been in the hands of the near royal presidency, but powerful foreign ministers can have a major influence, especially if they can get the ministry staff behind them.        

ONE sign of Mr. Jupp&eacute;&rsquo;s authority came early, when he insisted that Mr. Sarkozy remove his powerful chief of staff and friend, Claude Gu&eacute;ant, who was known to meddle in foreign policy, especially in Africa. Mr. Gu&eacute;ant became interior minister. Mr. Jupp&eacute; also pressed to reduce the unilateralism of the president&rsquo;s own foreign-policy staff, led by Jean-David Levitte, a consummate diplomat and a former ambassador to Washington. According to a new book, Mr. Jupp&eacute; reportedly told Mr. Sarkozy, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to carry your schoolbag.&rdquo;

There is some tragedy to Mr. Jupp&eacute;&rsquo;s story. The son of a Gaullist landowner in the Landes, in southwest France, he was recognized early on as very bright. He is a graduate of nearly all of France&rsquo;s finest schools, the Lyc&eacute;e Louis-le-Grand, the &Eacute;cole Normale Sup&eacute;rieure, the Institut d&rsquo;&Eacute;tudes Politiques de Paris and then, after military service, the &Eacute;cole Nationale d&rsquo;Administration, which trains France&rsquo;s governmental elite. He began his career as an inspector of finances.        

He was a close ally of former President Jacques Chirac and served as prime minister from 1995 to 1997; Mr. Chirac called him &ldquo;the best among us.&rdquo; His time as prime minister was not easy, however, and his plan for welfare reform in 1995 prompted major social unrest, leading him to withdraw his proposals.        

But when he served Mr. Chirac, then mayor of Paris, in the 1990s, while preparing his mentor&rsquo;s run for the presidency, Mr. Jupp&eacute; was involved in a scandal over &ldquo;fake jobs&rdquo; at City Hall that were intended for party workers preparing the next campaign.        

Mr. Chirac, given presidential immunity, is only now being tried on the charges, but Mr. Jupp&eacute; was convicted in 2004 of a felony misuse of public funds and sentenced to an 18-month suspended jail sentence and barred from holding elected office for 10 years. He appealed, and the sentence was reduced and the ban limited to one year. He quit as mayor of Bordeaux and spent the 2005-6 academic year in Montreal teaching, before being re-elected mayor in late 2006.        

He served briefly as junior minister for ecology in 2007, then lost a race for a seat in Parliament. But he was brought into the cabinet in triumph as defense minister in November 2010 and has since had an impressive resurrection.        

WHILE he repeats that Mr. Sarkozy is the best candidate for next year, Mr. Jupp&eacute; has also mused on the possibility of running for the presidency in 2017. On the plane, over a glass of Ch&acirc;teau Carbonnieux, a fine Bordeaux, he noted that Senator John McCain ran for the presidency at 72, the age a fit Mr. Jupp&eacute; will reach in 2017. Unspoken was the possibility, however remote, that Mr. Sarkozy, low in the polls, might not even choose to run for re-election.        

But despite his serious image, Mr. Jupp&eacute; has a more wistful side. In a 1993 book, &ldquo;The Temptation of Venice,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;From time to time, I have dreams of flight.&rdquo; He said he sometimes imagined another life in Venice, far from politics, &ldquo;in a small, ruined house, covered with brambles. I have imagined making a retreat there, even as a caretaker.&rdquo;
