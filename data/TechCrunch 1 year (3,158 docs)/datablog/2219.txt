This Kickstarter project has been kicking around the Internet a bit but its pretty cool. This is a handsome dock for your 11- or 13-inch air and includes 4 USB ports, an ethernet port, a DisplayPort, Kensington lock port, and power supply. To use it simply lock your MacBook into the LandingZones snug confines and start working.As a doofus who just set up a standing desk, this would be a livesaver. First it improves the Airs USB situation immensely and the ease of use would shave, at worst, a few seconds off of my start-up time and probably improve air circulation around the Air.The entry-level pledge is $159 and that gets you an 11- or 13-inch model. You can get two for $299. Id be wary given the upcoming changes we expect to the MacBook Air in the next few months, but not much in terms of port placement should change.Kitae Kwon, an engineer in Cupertino, created the dock and has been working on it for eight months. Hes set up a product page here. The product has 31 more days to reach $50,000 in funding. Considering its at $30,000 now, it shouldnt be too hard.Total of 4 USB 2.0 ports; no need to attach a separate USB hub
Built in 10/100T Ethernet port; no more dongles for the Ethernet or fumbling with the cable
Built in Mini DisplayPort capable of driving resolution up to 25601440
Built in locking port compatible with all the Kensington Locks; now you can secure your MacBook Air
Two models to support either the 11 or 13 version of the MacBook Air (2010 or later)
Beautifully designed and engineered for simplicity, elegance, reliability and functionality (patent pending)
Comes with US power adapter which accepts wide range of input voltage (100~240 Vac)
