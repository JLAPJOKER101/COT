A Chilean judge has opened an investigation into the death of the country&rsquo;s revered poet, Pablo Neruda, responding to allegations that he may have been poisoned just days after the 1973 coup, officials said Thursday. Mr. Neruda officially died of prostate cancer at 69 on Sept. 23, 1973, 12 days after the coup that toppled the government of his close friend, President Salvador Allende. But several witnesses, including Mr. Neruda&rsquo;s longtime associate and driver, Manuel Araya, have raised questions about his death. Mr. Araya has said the poet was poisoned by agents of Chile&rsquo;s dictator, Gen. Augusto Pinochet. The Pablo Neruda Foundation, which administers the poet&rsquo;s estate, said there was no evidence to support Mr. Araya&rsquo;s claim. Eduardo Contreras, a lawyer for the Communist Party, which requested the investigation, said that lawyers expect to request the exhumation of Mr. Neruda&rsquo;s body.
