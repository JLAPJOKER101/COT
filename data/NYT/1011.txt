A rocket fired from Gaza on Wednesday struck the southern Israeli city of Beersheba for the first time in two years, damaging one house but causing no physical injury, the Israeli police said. Israel carried out an airstrike soon after that in northern Gaza against what the military said was a rocket-firing squad.
