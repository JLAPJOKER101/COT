Preliminary tests have identified a case of hemorrhagic fever caused by the rare and deadly Ebola virus in central Uganda, a medical official said Friday. A young girl who&nbsp;died in a hospital in the town of Bombo, about 25 miles&nbsp;from the capital, Kampala, tested positive for the virus, said Dr. Nelson Mugisha, a member of the medical team working on the case.&nbsp;He said the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&nbsp;had &nbsp;helped the government with the initial diagnosis. The virus&nbsp;can lead&nbsp;to large outbreaks with high death rates.
