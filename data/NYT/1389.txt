An appeals court voted unanimously on Monday to reopen a criminal case into charges of the sexual abuse of minors by the Rev. Fernando Karadima, a Roman Catholic priest. A Vatican investigation found Father Karadima guilty last month of abusing minors and ordered him to retire to a &ldquo;life of prayer and penitence.&rdquo; A judge in Santiago closed a criminal case late last year, ruling there was not enough evidence to charge him. The appeals court ruled that the case should be reopened because the &ldquo;events, time and circumstances of the punishable acts had not been sufficiently investigated.&rdquo;
