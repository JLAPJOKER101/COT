A court formally opened an investigation on Tuesday into charges that Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, abused her power as France&rsquo;s finance minister in 2007 when she intervened in a legal conflict in which a prominent businessman was awarded hundreds of millions of dollars in state funds. Earlier, a court had thrown out the case brought by the businessman, Bernard Tapie, a friend of President Nicolas Sarkozy and himself a former minister, who accused a state-owned bank of defrauding him in a 1993 transaction. Ms. Lagarde ordered the case sent to an arbitration panel, which awarded Mr. Tapie a settlement of about $580 million.
