Security forces have battled militants in the Mohmand tribal region near the Afghan border for two days, officials said Friday. The skirmishes began Thursday when troops in the Paizai area came under attack, said Maqsood Hasan, a deputy administrator. The troops returned fire, killing 10 insurgent suspects, and called for air support. The government said more than 80 militants and several civilians had been killed over two days. There was no way to verify that assertion independently. The military has repeatedly tried to flush the Taliban and Al Qaeda from the area.
