The police have released five men who were arrested this week near the Sellafield nuclear processing facility in northwest England. They were freed without charges, the Greater Manchester Police said Wednesday. The men, all in their 20s and from London, were questioned by antiterrorism police officers before being released. Activities at the Sellafield facility include recycling fuel and processing nuclear waste.
