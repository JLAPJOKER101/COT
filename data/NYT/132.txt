South African authorities say at least 39 people have died in flooding and thunderstorms in the eastern part of the country. Officials confirmed Friday that 26 people, including 4 children, have died as a result of adverse weather conditions in the rural Eastern Cape Province since mid-December. In the neighboring KwaZulu-Natal Province, the police said six people drowned as a result of flooding last week, and seven people were killed in a lightning strike there on Sunday.
