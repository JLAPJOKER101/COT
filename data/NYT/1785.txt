The police arrested up to 15 activists before a protest planned for Saturday, opposition parties said Friday. A spokesman for the parties said that the 15 activists had been arrested on different charges, including defying the police and hooliganism, and were told by the police to refrain from participating in a rally on Saturday that has not been approved by authorities. The police detained about 150 people at opposition rallies in the capital, Baku, last month.
