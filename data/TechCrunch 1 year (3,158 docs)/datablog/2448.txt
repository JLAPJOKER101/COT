Google is launching a new native Gmail application for the iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch today, which is now available in the iTunes App Store. As recently revealed by TechCrunch writer MG Siegler on his personal blog, one of the apps most important features is its ability to do push notifications. The app will also include search, autocomplete, support for attachments, priority inbox access, labels and other standard email features like archiving, deleting and reporting spam.For many, the new app should be an improvement over the already available Web-based application for Gmail because of its support for push notifications  something that the iPhone itself cant do for Gmail without hacking it to work through Exchange. That alone may be reason to switch.UPDATE: Ugh! According to early reviews (and tons of Twitter complaints), the push notifications feature is broken and the app doesnt support multiple accounts.
