The government lifted a six-month ban on mining in eastern Congo on Thursday. President Joseph Kabila announced the ban on mining and trade in minerals in September, saying he wanted to stop the conflict fueled by the minerals. &ldquo;Six months later, the situation is even worse and peace still has not been restored to eastern Congo,&rdquo; the African Association for the Defense of Human Rights said in a statement.
