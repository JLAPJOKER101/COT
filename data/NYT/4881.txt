Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the former head of the International Monetary Fund who returned to Paris after New York prosecutors dropped charges of attempted rape against him, will be interviewed on Sunday on France&rsquo;s most-watched news program, a spokesman at the TF1 television channel said. It will be Mr. Strauss-Kahn&rsquo;s first interview since his arrest in New York in May. Mr. Strauss-Kahn, 62, who had been considered a strong rival to the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, in the 2012 presidential election, is expected to be asked about his political future, the future of his party and the current crisis of the euro, among other things.
