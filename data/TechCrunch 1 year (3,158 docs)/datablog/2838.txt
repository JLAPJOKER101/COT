I know that a lot of you have probably already seen this awesome awesome video, but for some reason I missed out on itprobably because Ive been asleep all weekend so Im reposting it again, in case you guys were also preoccupied with you know, stuff. Here is singer songwriter Stevie Wonder, who happens to be blind from childhood, singing the praises of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs for making the iPhone and the iPad handicap-friendly.Im going to assume that Wonder, who made a surprise appearance at the WONDERFULL event at the Echoplex in Echo Park where the above video was taken, is referring specifically to the VoiceOver function of iOS where blind users can touch the device screen to hear a description of the item under their fingers as well as optional iOS features like the Bluetooth braille keyboard and already existent services like Facetime, which makes it easier for deaf people to communicate in Sign via video.Wonders exact words:I want you all to give a hand to someone that you know whose health is very bad at this time. His company took the challenge in making his technology accessible to everyone. In the spirit of caring and moving the world forward: Steve Jobs. Because theres nothing on the iPhone or the iPad that you can do that I cant do. As a matter of fact, I can be talking to you, you can be looking at me, and I can be doing whatever I need to do and you dont even know what Im doing. Yeah!Oftentimes many of us in the industry overlook the difficulties that some of us face in interacting with technology, so props to Wonder, and Jobs, and others for bringing these concerns and the progress being made in the realm of tech accessibility to light. Weve still got a long ways to go. Yeah.Via: LA Times
