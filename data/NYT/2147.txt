Large parts of el-Feid, a town in Sudan&rsquo;s Nuba Mountains, have been burned to the ground, satellite images from a research organization, the Satellite Sentinel Project, show. More than 350 structures were set on fire a week ago, the organization said Tuesday, noting that, according to a local politician, at least 20 people were killed in the attack. It said that many of the structures appeared to be traditional homes and that the attackers&rsquo; identities had not been determined. An election for governor is scheduled for next month in the State of South Kordofan, where el-Feid is located. The region has traditionally been aligned with the South, which voted in January to separate from the North. According to a 2005 peace agreement, the region is supposed to decide it&rsquo;s own destiny by July.
