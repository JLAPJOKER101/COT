An opposition party has written an open letter to the government demanding that it account for hundreds of thousands of acres being leased to private investors and foreign governments. The government has said it needs foreign investors because it cannot afford the cost of developing its vast bushlands into productive farmland. The letter from the Party for National Renaissance questioned whether the government was giving the land away to countries including Libya, China and Brazil without ensuring that food sufficiency was the priority. It demanded that the government release the financial details of the leases, as well as the required environmental impact studies.
