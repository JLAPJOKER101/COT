A French court on Friday postponed for the second time a decision about investigating claims that Christine Lagarde, the new chief of the International Monetary Fund, abused her power as the French finance minister in 2008. A decision is now expected on Aug. 4. At issue is her intervention in a legal battle between the businessman Bernard Tapie and the Cr&eacute;dit Lyonnais bank. As finance minister, Ms. Lagarde cut short legal proceedings and chose independent arbitration instead. Mr. Tapie was awarded about 400 million euros.
