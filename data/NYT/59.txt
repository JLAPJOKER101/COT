Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday read aloud in Parliament a letter asking President Obama for clemency for Jonathan Jay Pollard, left, the American serving a life term in a United States prison for spying for Israel. The letter, which was sent this week, constitutes the first formal and public Israeli appeal for Mr. Pollard&rsquo;s release. &ldquo;Even though Israel was in no way directing its intelligence efforts against the United States,&rdquo; Mr. Netanyahu wrote, &ldquo;its actions were wrong and wholly unacceptable.&rdquo; After 25 years in prison, he added, Mr. Pollard &ldquo;has reportedly served longer in prison than any person convicted of similar crimes, and longer than the period requested by the prosecutors at the time of his plea bargain agreement.&rdquo; Obama administration officials recently indicated that Mr. Pollard&rsquo;s release was unlikely.
