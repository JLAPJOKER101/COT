The French foreign minister, Alain Jupp&eacute;, met with the Palestinian prime minister, Salam Fayyad, in Ramallah and the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, in Jerusalem on Thursday in a last-ditch effort to revive peace negotiations before an expected showdown at the United Nations in September. Mr. Jupp&eacute; said he hoped both sides would meet in Paris by early July for talks based on proposals put forward last month by President Obama. &ldquo;I would be lying if I said I was very optimistic,&rdquo; he said after the meetings. &ldquo;I am slightly optimistic.&rdquo;
