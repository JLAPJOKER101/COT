Militants on Tuesday attacked a pipeline carrying natural gas from Egypt to Jordan and Israel. It was the sixth attack on the pipeline since the ouster of President Hosni Mubarak in February. Security officials said the militants set off an explosion at a pumping station outside the town of Al Arish in the northern Sinai Peninsula. Two people were killed and several buildings were damaged. Israel usually relies on Egyptian gas to meet 40 percent of its electricity needs, but damage from an attack in July brought shipments to a halt. The authorities did not name suspects in the attack.
