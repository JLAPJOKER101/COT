BEIRUT, Lebanon &mdash; In the besieged city of Dara&rsquo;a, which has become a symbol of Syria&rsquo;s uprising, residents on Wednesday told of shortages of bread and even baby formula. Some stick a pole wrapped in a scarf out the door to see whether snipers are lurking. Doctors in a mosque have resorted to using sewing needles to stitch wounds, amid shortages of bandages and disinfectant.        

Some spoke of moments of camaraderie in the three-day blockade, as Palestinians from nearby refugee camps ferried canned food and bread by foot to Dara&rsquo;a, a poor border town in a drought-stricken region where protests last month galvanized nationwide demonstrations. Others spoke of a deepening fear of snipers by day, raids by night and people so scared they would not open their doors, even to neighbors.        

&ldquo;Dara&rsquo;a and its hinterland are a ghost town,&rdquo; one resident of the area said as he fled across the border to Jordan on Wednesday. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t go in and you can&rsquo;t go out.&rdquo;        

As the crackdown in Dara&rsquo;a entered its fourth day on Thursday, opposition activists reported a growing number of resignations from the Baath Party, which has ruled Syria in some fashion since 1963. Though the figures did not occupy senior positions, activists said the resignations were symbolically important, signaling the willingness of people to defy the inevitable repercussions and forego the privileges that membership secured.        

Wissam Tarif, executive director of Insan, a human rights group, said 203 people had resigned from the party in the region around Dara&rsquo;a, 64 in restive towns on the outskirts of the capital Damascus and 30 in Baniyas, a town on the Mediterranean coast.        

&ldquo;They&rsquo;re not necessarily big-shot politicians, but they are loyal to the regime and they had influence within the party,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a sign. It&rsquo;s a kind of response.&rdquo;        

Dara&rsquo;a has become the center stage of an uprising that has posed the greatest challenge to the Assad family&rsquo;s four decades of rule. While other towns reel from a cycle of protests and funerals for the fallen that turn into more protests, Dara&rsquo;a is the town the government has sought, through force of arms since Monday, to pummel back into loyalty. For weeks a symbol of people&rsquo;s anger at arbitrary power, it has now become a test of whether the protests will weather a crackdown in full swing.        

In the end, this town may determine whether the government &mdash; staggering but still entrenched, playing on fears of chaos in a county still deeply divided by its sects and ethnicities &mdash; can reinstill the fear that the protests broke.        

&ldquo;The regime may be able to stop the uprising in two or three weeks with a crackdown,&rdquo; said Alaa Hourani, a Dara&rsquo;a resident, &ldquo;but they cannot finish it forever.&rdquo;        

Almost no foreign journalists are allowed in Syria, much less Dara&rsquo;a, and an authoritative account of conditions in the town of 75,000 is impossible.        

In past days, it has become a caldron of rumors and conflicting sentiments. Over the phone on Wednesday, a man shouted that 150 soldiers had defected to the opposition, but even some human rights activists remained skeptical of decisive splits in the military. Some residents denounced President Bashar al-Assad, while those fleeing across the border said that he still enjoyed their support and that anger was more pronounced against his family &mdash; his brother Maher, who leads the Fourth Armored Division, deployed in Dara&rsquo;a, and his brother-in-law, Assef Shawkat, an intelligence chief and deputy chief of staff.        

&ldquo;These are Maher&rsquo;s people,&rdquo; said the resident fleeing to Jordan. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re barbaric. Nobody can control them except Maher, and Bashar cannot control Maher.&rdquo;        

Across Syria, the siege of Dara&rsquo;a has become a rallying cry, demonstrating its resonance to an uprising still in search of leadership and coherence.        

&ldquo;&nbsp;&lsquo;The people of Dara&rsquo;a are free!&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; an activist abroad quoted dissidents shouting during protests in towns on the outskirts of the capital, Damascus. &ldquo;&nbsp;&lsquo;Bashar, get out of Dara&rsquo;a!&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; others cried, the activist said.        

The protests erupted in Dara&rsquo;a in March after 15 students were arrested for writing antigovernment graffiti on school walls. &ldquo;The people want to topple the regime,&rdquo; the slogans said, in an echo of the revolutions in Egypt and Tunisia. Security in the town was run by Atef Najib, a relative of Mr. Assad, and, by most accounts, the youths were tortured.
