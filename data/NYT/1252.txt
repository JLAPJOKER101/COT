Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi had four hours of facial surgery on Monday to repair damage he suffered when a man hurled a statuette at him in 2009. Mr. Berlusconi suffered broken teeth and a broken nose in the attack at the end of political rally in Milan. His office said the surgery was to &ldquo;restore the anatomy and jaw function that had been gravely compromised&rdquo; in the attack.
