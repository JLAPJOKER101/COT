In a first for Angola, emerging from decades of war, scientists say that they have discovered a dinosaur fossil there of an uncataloged species. A paper in the Annals of the Brazilian Academy of Sciences describes a long-necked, plant-eating sauropod, among the largest creatures ever to have walked the earth. The international team that found and identified the fossil is calling the species Angolatitan adamastor &mdash; adamastor is a sea giant from Portuguese sailing myths. The fossil was found along with fish and shark teeth in what would have been a seabed 90 million years ago, leading to a theory that the dinosaur might have been swept into the sea and torn apart by sharks.
