PARIS &mdash; Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the former head of the International Monetary Fund who returned to Paris last week after New York prosecutors dropped rape charges against him, was questioned for three hours on Monday about a sexual assault complaint dating to 2003, his lawyers said.        

In that case, a writer, Tristane Banon, now 32, has accused Mr. Strauss-Kahn of trying to rape her as she was interviewing him for a book. She lodged the complaint in July, saying that she had been advised not to press charges on the advice of her mother, a prominent member of the Socialist party, as is Mr. Strauss-Kahn. She said she changed her mind after his arrest in New York in May. The Paris prosecutor&rsquo;s office opened a preliminary investigation and questioned several high-profile people last summer, including Fran&ccedil;ois Hollande, a leading Socialist presidential candidate.        

Mr. Strauss-Kahn has called the episode &ldquo;imaginary&rdquo; and filed a counter-complaint of slander against Ms. Banon. It is not yet clear whether French prosecutors will decide to open a formal investigation or drop the case. While the criminal case against him in New York was dropped, he faces a civil suit brought by the hotel maid who says he raped her.        

Ms. Banon recently said on her Facebook page that Mr. Strauss-Kahn&rsquo;s return had sickened her and that she was ashamed of a country that &ldquo;welcomes as a hero a man who hasn&rsquo;t been cleared.&rdquo;
