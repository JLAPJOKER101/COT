The Arab League on Thursday endorsed a Palestinian plan to seek full membership at the United Nations this fall, setting up a likely confrontation with the United States. Negotiations with Israel on the terms of Palestinian statehood have been frozen since 2008. As an alternative, the Palestinians have decided to seek United Nations recognition of an independent Palestine in the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem, areas Israel captured in the 1967 war. There was no immediate official reaction from Israel or the United States. However, the United States, one of the five permanent members of the Security Council, would be expected to veto a Palestinian membership request, which would derail a quest for full United Nations recognition. As an alternative, the Palestinians could go to the General Assembly and seek recognition there as a nonmember observer state, a largely symbolic move.
