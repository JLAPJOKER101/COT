A missile believed to have been fired from an American drone struck a car in southern Yemen on Thursday, killing two brothers thought to be Qaeda militants, security and tribal officials said. The Defense Ministry confirmed the deaths of the brothers in Shabwa Province, but it would not provide further details. In September, Yemen said it was banning American drone strikes, but they were believed to have resumed after Al Qaeda smuggled explosives on cargo planes bound for the United States in October.
