LONDON &mdash; St. Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral has suspended legal action to evict hundreds of anti-capitalist protesters camped outside its doors, according to a statement on Tuesday.        

The move was &ldquo;unanimously agreed,&rdquo; the statement said, after the intervention of the Bishop of London, the most senior Anglican figure in the city.        

It follows days of turmoil within the church over the camp &mdash; a mass of hundreds of tents that is part of the Occupy protest movement. Two of the leaders at the historic church, Canon Giles Fraser and the dean, Graeme Knowles, had resigned in recent days.        

The City of London Corporation, a civic body that oversees the financial district,&nbsp; meanwhile, said it had &ldquo;paused&rdquo; legal action to remove the protesters while officials meet for more talks, The Associated Press reported.
