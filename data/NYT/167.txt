The militant Basque separatist group ETA declared a permanent cease-fire on Monday, in what it called a firm step toward ending a independence fight of decades. But Spain&rsquo;s government dismissed the announcement as not going far enough, and demanded ETA disband and lay down its arms. The cease-fire was announced in a video distributed to the news media. The group did not mention dissolving or giving up weapons &mdash; key demands from successive Spanish governments. Prime Minister Jos&eacute; Luis Rodr&iacute;guez Zapatero, left, said that ETA&rsquo;s plan was not enough and that the group must take &ldquo;more forceful and definitive steps.&rdquo;
