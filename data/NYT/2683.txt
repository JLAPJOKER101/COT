The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda on Tuesday sentenced Rwanda&rsquo;s former army chief of staff, Maj. Gen. Augustin Bizimungu, to 30 years in prison for ordering killings during the 1994 genocide. The tribunal, established by the United Nations and located in Arusha, Tanzania, also sentenced three other top officers; the presiding judge, Asoka de Silva, said General Bizimungu was responsible for the conduct of his subordinates. The indictment against the general said he gave an order &ldquo;to exterminate the small cockroaches&rdquo; on the first day of the 100-day genocide, in which an estimated 800,000 ethnic Tutsis and moderate Hutus were slaughtered.
