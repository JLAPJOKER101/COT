ATHENS &mdash; As he traded the political upheaval of the Middle East for the economic storms of Europe, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has preached a consistent message on his travels: &ldquo;The United States isn&rsquo;t going anywhere,&rdquo; as he put it on Sunday.        

It is a challenging, even far-fetched, argument to make at a time when the United States is pulling its last soldiers out of Iraq &mdash; scrambling the calculus of players in the region &mdash; and when it is not offering to rescue Greece or other debt-ridden European countries.        

Mr. Biden acknowledged the need to reassure allies, noting that in Turkey and Iraq last week, every leader he met voiced uneasiness about what would happen after the American troops departed. On Monday, he was scheduled to meet with the new prime minister of Greece, Lucas Papademos; officials made it clear he was bearing good will, not loan guarantees.        

&ldquo;All of my interlocutors raise the same concern,&rdquo; Mr. Biden said to reporters traveling with him on Air Force Two, as he flew to Athens from Istanbul. &ldquo;What about Iran? What about Iranian influence? America leaving &mdash; is there going to be a vacuum?&rdquo;        

Mr. Biden said he had pledged that the United States would stay committed to Iraq through a large civilian presence. He played down fears about Iran exploiting the American withdrawal by increasing its influence. And he said that despite Syria&rsquo;s prominent role in the region, he did not believe its bloody uprising would spill across its borders.        

&ldquo;There was a sense,&rdquo; Mr. Biden said of his meeting with Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, &ldquo;that it would be able to be handled without any conflagration going beyond Syria, and that it could be localized to Syria, and that transition could take place.&rdquo;        

Turkey and the United States are talking about economic assistance and advice for Syria in forming a government after the fall of President Bashar al-Assad, which Mr. Biden said was &ldquo;probable.&rdquo; But he did not say whether the United States had found a viable representative of the opposition movement, which is more fractured than the one in Libya that overthrew the government of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi.        

Turkey has differed with the United States about how to deal with Iran and has rejected President Obama&rsquo;s call for additional sanctions over Tehran&rsquo;s nuclear program. Mr. Biden said he and Mr. Erdogan had an honest exchange about those disagreements.        

&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to sound like Newt Gingrich,&rdquo; Mr. Biden said, before stopping himself midsentence, with a sheepish smile, and looking upward as if for divine intervention.        

&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to sound like I&rsquo;m inflating my importance or relationship with him,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;but we have listened to each other. And he was genuinely listening to my perspective and wasn&rsquo;t challenging it.&rdquo;        

Mr. Biden also said he had acknowledged to Mr. Erdogan that &ldquo;we can&rsquo;t guarantee you that these sanctions are going to bring about any fundamental changes we desire&rdquo; in deterring Iran&rsquo;s nuclear ambitions. &ldquo;But the fact of the matter is that they are hurting,&rdquo; he said.        

If the vice president had arguments to make in Turkey and Iraq, he will mainly be offering moral support in Greece. On Monday, in addition to talks with Mr. Papademos, he is to meet with former Prime Minister George A. Papandreou, who resigned amid the deepening crisis.        

Mr. Biden shied away from predictions or prescriptions for Europe, though he confirmed discussion of the International Monetary Fund playing a greater role in the rescue efforts.        

&ldquo;All the parties know what has to be done,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not like there&rsquo;s a fundamental disagreement on the big elements of what has to be done to get the euro zone in shape. They all know that there&rsquo;s no easy way. It&rsquo;s going to be painful.&rdquo;
