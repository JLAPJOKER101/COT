The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, the rebel group known as the FARC, disclosed Tuesday that its secretariat had named Rodrigo Londo&ntilde;o as its new top commander. The FARC said in a statement that the decision was made unanimously by the group&rsquo;s leadership on Nov. 5, a day after Colombian forces killed Alfonso Cano, the previous commander. Mr. Londo&ntilde;o, 52, who uses the aliases Timochenko and Timole&oacute;n Jim&eacute;nez, is considered one of the FARC&rsquo;s leading intelligence operatives and a mastermind of its cocaine trafficking activities. The United States Department of State is offering a reward of as much as $5 million for the capture of Mr. Londo&ntilde;o, who American officials say has ordered subordinates to increase production of coca, the plant used to make cocaine, and kidnap American citizens.
