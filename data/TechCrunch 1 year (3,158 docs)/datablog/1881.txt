But chipmakers deserve your love too, which is why you should sit back and relax while you check out this webcast of Nvidias live press conference at the CES 2012 International show in Las Vegas. We have no idea what well see here but chances are itll make a big difference in the way we use our gadgetry over the next year. Ive got my fingers crossed for more efficient processing (read: longer battery life), since weve already seen Nvidias quad-core chip, the Tegra 3. Update: Webcast no longer live.
