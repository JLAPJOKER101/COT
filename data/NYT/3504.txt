Riot police officers fired tear gas and stun grenades on Thursday to disperse thousands of opposition supporters gathered near the square that was the center of the Shiite-led demonstrations this year, an activist said. The demonstrators were demanding the ouster of the Sunni monarch, King Hamad bin Isa al-Khalifa, above, and the release of detained demonstrators and opposition leaders. The violence was a setback to efforts by the government to open reconciliation talks with the Shiite opposition.
