President Hugo Ch&aacute;vez says he is certain he will pursue a re-election bid next year even as he struggles to overcome cancer. In an interview published Monday in the government newspaper Correo del Orinoco, Mr. Ch&aacute;vez said that he had not &ldquo;for an instant thought about withdrawing from the presidency&rdquo; and that he would pursue the campaign &ldquo;with more strength than before.&rdquo; Mr. Ch&aacute;vez, who has been in office since 1999, had surgery in Cuba on June 20 to remove a cancerous tumor, although he has not said what type of cancer it is.
