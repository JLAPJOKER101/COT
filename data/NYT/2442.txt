The government has banned all spy dramas and any related programs from being broadcast on major television networks from May to July, according to reports on Thursday in the Chinese news media. The government agency in charge of regulating entertainment programming has not announced a reason for the ban, but observers speculate that it may be an effort to clear the way for official programming in the run-up to the 90th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party on July 1. Spy dramas scheduled for May, June or July must be rescheduled for later in the year. In April, the agency issued a guideline discouraging the production of time travel dramas for television.
