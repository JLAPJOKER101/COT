Twistory, which lets people save their tweet backlog to their favorite calendaring application, has finally come through with full support for popular Web-based calendaring service Google Calendar.You can now subscribe to Twistory using your existing Twitter account and automatically view in Google Calendar when youve tweeted what. Up until now, compatibility with Google Calendar was a little flaky, but the team behind Twistory tells me it is now finally stable.Twistory is available for free, allowing you to visualize your last month worth of tweets in your calendaring application of choice. Theres also a paid version, Twistory Pro ($1/month), which gives you access to your entire Twitter backlog (currently limited by Twitter to 3,200 tweets) and allows you to export your entire Twitter history as a CSV file.
