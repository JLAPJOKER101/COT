HAVANA &mdash; Alejandrina Hern&aacute;ndez packed only light clothes and a makeup bag when she flew here from Miami this spring. As always, she kept her baggage to a minimum.        

Her own baggage, that is.        

Ms. Hern&aacute;ndez also brought more than 100 pounds of food, clothes and medicine for her family and other Cubans whose relatives in the United States paid her $8 a pound to ferry gifts.        

&ldquo;I need to see my family, but these trips are very expensive,&rdquo; said Ms. Hern&aacute;ndez, who has returned eight times to see her husband and mother in the past 18 months. &ldquo;This way, I more or less break even.&rdquo;        

Ms. Hern&aacute;ndez is part of a surge in Cuban and Cuban-American visitors from the United States since President Obama lifted travel restrictions in 2009 for those with family here.        

Economists and travel agents estimate that 400,000 passengers will fly to Cuba from the United States this year, nearly four times the number in 2008 &mdash; and more than at any time since the United States cut ties with the island some 50 years ago, they say. The visitors bring cash and huge bundles stuffed with goods that the embargo and Cuba&rsquo;s economic woes have put beyond reach, from basics like milk powder, bouillon cubes and vitamins to luxuries like BlackBerrys and flat-screen televisions. Much of it goes into the living rooms and pantries of relatives, or to retailers who operate Cuba&rsquo;s voracious informal market.        

But the money and goods also feed Cuba&rsquo;s budding private sector, the frail backbone of President Ra&uacute;l Castro&rsquo;s plan to reinvigorate the country&rsquo;s feeble economy. Many entrepreneurs say they get capital and supplies from relatives abroad &mdash; colored beads from Miami for religious trinkets, pepper mills for restaurant tables, beautician&rsquo;s wax.        

Opponents of greater contact with Cuba say such openings simply help to keep the Castro government afloat. Senator Marco Rubio, a Republican from Florida whose parents are Cuban exiles, has called remittances and travel by Cuban-Americans &ldquo;perhaps the single largest source of revenue to the most repressive government in the region.&rdquo;        

A State Department official, who requested anonymity because the policy is politically delicate, said that &ldquo;additional people-to-people contact and enhanced economic independence from the state&rdquo; helped to &ldquo;undermine repression.&rdquo; In an e-mail responding to questions, the official said such benefits outweighed concerns about &ldquo;the Cuban government profiting indirectly.&rdquo;        

In 2004, President George W. Bush limited family visits to once every three years, reducing them from once a year, but now Cubans and Cuban-Americans may visit relatives as often as they want and send them any amount of money.        

The Obama administration also relaxed restrictions on travel by non-Cuban Americans. In March, it expanded the number of airports that can handle direct flights to Cuba, to 11 from 3. And it now allows any American to send Cubans up to $2,000 a year to help private businesses.
         

Manuel Orozco, an expert at the Inter-American Dialogue, a center for policy analysis, said remittances to Cuba &mdash; estimated at $900 million to $1.4 billion last year &mdash; were important to the small businesses springing up on the island. But he said Cuban expatriates would wait for deeper reforms in Cuba &mdash; or details on the nation&rsquo;s new rules allowing property and car sales &mdash; before they sent larger amounts.        

&ldquo;Nobody in the diaspora is going to invest $10,000 right now,&rdquo; he said.        

Still, the stream of visitors is fueling Cuba&rsquo;s small but growing consumer culture. And in a country where most people earn about $20 per month in return for social services and subsidies, consumption of any kind is conspicuous.        

Arn&oacute;l Rodr&iacute;guez, who left Cuba 11 years ago and lives in Rochester, N.Y., sat at a fancy Havana hotel this spring, watching his son and some friends eat pizza and jiggle to reggaet&oacute;n.        

&ldquo;This is something they could never, ever, afford,&rdquo; said Mr. Rodr&iacute;guez, 49, who spent $200 treating 10 local friends and relatives to a day at the pool. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care how much it costs me.&rdquo;        

Mr. Rodr&iacute;guez, on his 14th trip home, said he brought seven suitcases carrying test kits for his diabetic brother, shoes, clothes, chocolate, a PlayStation 2, two hard drives and a DVD player.

Armando Garc&iacute;a, president of Marazul Charters, which operates daily flights between the United States and Cuba, said Cubans of all kinds were buying tickets. But frequent visitors were mainly those who left in the early 1990s and after, when the hardship of the post-Soviet era led to an exodus.        

&ldquo;This is a generation that is not informed by cold war politics, but by the politics of survival,&rdquo; Mr. Orozco said.        

Unlike those who left soon after Fidel Castro&rsquo;s 1959 revolution, more recent &eacute;migr&eacute;s tend to stay in touch, exchanging jokes and news by text message, telephone or e-mail.        

&ldquo;It is helping destroy the myth of separation&rdquo; between islanders and the 1.8-million-strong Cuban community in the United States, said Katrin Hansing, a professor at the City University of New York.        

Once on the island, the &eacute;migr&eacute;s slip back into their social networks, taking relatives to dinner, going dancing with friends, baptizing their children and getting checkups from doctors in Cuba&rsquo;s health care system. Leonel Morales, 34, who left for Miami three years ago, came back in February for the first time to be inducted into santer&iacute;a, a religion practiced here. The process would have cost three times as much in Florida, he said.        

While in Havana, Mr. Morales also saw a doctor he knew about a chronic stomach complaint. A visit to a doctor in Florida had cost him $7,000.        

Ms. Hern&aacute;ndez, who has lived in Florida for six years with her son, tells her husband and friends about her long hours working as a chambermaid, about the perils of mortgages, about the delights of ubiquitous air-conditioning and the Internet.        

&ldquo;Cubans are a bit mistaken about what life is like in America,&rdquo; said Ms. Hernandez, 50. &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t know how hard it is, how much you have to work. At the same time, you see the fruits of your labor. You come back here and see that everything is falling apart.&rdquo;        

Although she misses her family and the distinctive smell of Cuba&rsquo;s sea, enough to bring tears to her eyes, Ms. Hern&aacute;ndez said she would stay in Florida until her son finished college or her sore joints prevented her from working, shuttling between her trailer in Hialeah and her husband&rsquo;s noisy home in a warren of apartments carved from a once-grand Havana building.        

&ldquo;I have half my heart here and the other half there,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The sad thing is, I am not really happy in either place.&rdquo;
