TEHRAN (Reuters) &mdash; An Iranian flotilla that was sailing to Bahrain to show solidarity with protesters there has halted its mission, Iran&rsquo;s official news agency, IRNA, reported Tuesday.        

Bahrain had called the flotilla a blatant interference in its affairs.        

The Iranian government had told the convoy, which included 120 students, clerics and activists, to abandon its plan, IRNA said.        

&ldquo;Following the frequent requests of the authorities to stop the flotilla, a gathering was held onboard, and it was concluded to stop the fleet,&rdquo; the organizer of the mission, Mehdi Eqrarian, was quoted as saying by IRNA.        

Bahrain, a tiny kingdom where a Sunni Muslim monarchy rules over a population with a Shiite majority, has accused Iran of fomenting unrest, which has been led primarily by Shiites.        

Iran, a majority Shiite country, has welcomed popular uprisings in the Arab world, calling them an &ldquo;Islamic awakening&rdquo; against despotic rulers, and it says the revolts were influenced by its own 1979 Islamic Revolution.
