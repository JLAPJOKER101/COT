Turkey will levy taxes of about 30 percent on Syrian goods after President Bashar al-Assad of Syria suspended a free-trade agreement and imposed taxes on Turkish exports, Hayati Yazici, the Turkish minister of customs and trade, said Wednesday. Relations between the two countries have deteriorated since August, when Mr. Assad failed to take steps to end a deadly crackdown on dissent. Since then, Turkey has halted joint energy exploration, joined the Arab League&rsquo;s sanctions against its once-close ally, threatened to expand embargoes, and started shipping routes to Egypt and Lebanon to circumvent Syria, which has blocked Turkish trucks.
