The tech world woke up today to reports of an imminent Apple TV, as Apple works to solidify deals with content providers. The rumored television product could indeed be ground-breaking, not just for television, but for computing as a whole. Were hearing exactly what Nick Bilton reported earlier this year, that Apple is going to integrate Siri into Apple TV as well as other iOS devices.In fact a multi-platform Siri could be unveiled as early as next week, when Apple announces the iPad 3.Hardcore right? Well our friends over in Mountain View, never ones to miss out on an opportunity to compete, have come up with their own answer to Siri, Google Assistant (earlier reports had it pegged as Majel, I have no idea whether that name was scrapped but do know that Assistant is not a part of GoogleX as Majel was).Google has had the in-house voice technology for ages  it hired Mike Cohen, the guy who started Nuance. But Assistant is set to go beyond Siri in many ways, most importantly in that the search company will retain complete control of all the layers involved.The project, helmed by the Android team with the involvement of search engineer Amit Singhal, has three parts according to a source.1) Get the worlds knowledge into a format a computer can understand.2) Create a personalization layer  Experiments like Google +1 and Google+ are Googles way of gathering data on precisely how people interact with content.3) Build a mobile, voice-centered Do engine (Assistant) thats less about returning search results and more about accomplishing real-life goals.Unlike Apple with Siri, Google is planning on extending this service to developers so they can build novel things. Imagine the possibilities for apps, websites, etc interested in hooking into Assistant?From what I know, Google has now set its ambitions beyond social and is focused wholeheartedly on building this Do engine, or goal oriented search: 2011 was the year of social for Google. 2012 is the year of Assistant.According to one source, Google higher-ups plan on unveiling the Assistant product by the fourth quarter of 2012, though they themselves are uncertain. Because our details are sparse for now, the fact that we might be missing a huge piece of this puzzle is also a possibility.Email me if you know more, its alexia@techcrunch.comImage: Warren Goldswain
