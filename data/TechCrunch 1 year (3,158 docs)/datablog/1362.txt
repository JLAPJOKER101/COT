Eric Schmidt-backed receipt tracking service Slice is bringing its handy, organizational platform to Android devices.Slice offers Yahoo Mail, Gmail and iPhone apps that help you organize your online shopping by analyzing your inbox. It’s sort of like what TripIt does for your itineraries, except Slice tracks receipts, notices and purchases.Once you sign up, the app automatically aggregates and pulls information from the electronic receipts in your email and organizes it in one place. The startup says that receipts and purchases often get lost in your inbox and the app consolidates your shopping history in one place so you don’t have to log into multiple websites, dig through receipts or manually file emails. Slice for the iPhone gives you access to all this information on the go.With the launch of the Android app, users will also be able to view and organize purchases made using Google Wallet. The app will track all your in-progress shipments on a single map as they make their way to your front door, with detailed information about the contents of the package and where it is coming from. Push notifications let you know when a purchase has shipped and when it gets delivered.Slice will also give you historical purchase details beyond what’s provided in your credit card statement, showing you exactly what you bought down to the individual item, not just where you bought it.Since launching in May of 2010, Slice has processed more than 10 million purchases. Slice faces competition from  Lemon.
