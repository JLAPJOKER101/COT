President Asif Ali Zardari will be likely to need two weeks to rest in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, after medical treatment there before he returns home, the prime minister said. Mr. Zardari, left, flew to Dubai last week for treatment related to a heart condition, setting off rumors that he was fleeing army attempts to oust him because of a scandal that has already forced the Pakistani ambassador to the United States to resign. The government initially said Mr. Zardari&rsquo;s trip was routine and that he would be home in a few days. Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani, in an interview with the BBC late Sunday, denied reports that the president had had a stroke and said that Mr. Zardari needed medical attention because he was &ldquo;exhausted&rdquo; and that he was improving.
