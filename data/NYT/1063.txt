Sudan&rsquo;s army has attacked remnants of a divided rebel movement in western Darfur, setting off clashes that killed 25 of the rebels and 2 government soldiers, a military spokesman said Friday. In the fighting on Thursday, soldiers attacked several rebel positions in the Jebel Marra area, the spokesman said, part of a military push to open roads and secure villages in the area and drive out remnants of the Sudan Liberation Movement. After eight years of fighting in Darfur, the army is still trying to clear pockets of rebel fighters in the vast desert region.
