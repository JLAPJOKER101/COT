Social ad startup Unified just announced that it has hired Calvin Lui as its president and chief strategy officer.Lui was formerly president and CEO of online ad startup Tumri. He also served as chief operating officer for Internet marketer Connexus and SVP of sales and marketing for Ticketmaster. At Unified, Lui says hell be looking at companywide strategy, as well as corporate and business development. Hell report directly to CEO Sheldon Owen, who will oversee day-to-day operations and sales.Today is Luis first official day on the job, but hes been advising the company for the past year, and I met up with him earlier this week to discuss his new role. He said he signed up because theres a huge opportunity here, with social media transforming user behavior, and as a result, Marketers at this point are really ready for enterprise technology solutions.Thats where Unified comes in, with tools that brands and agencies to manage social ad campaigns.The company likes to tout the fact that its executive team has enterprise experience and isnt just a bunch of ad guys (it has ad experience too). Now it looks like the real enterprise tech giants are getting interested in the market, with Oracle acquiring Vitrue and Salesforce acquiring Buddy Media. Lui says Unified has a slightly different focus than companies like Buddy, which have built tools for owned audience management (i.e., helping companies engage with their Facebook fans), rather than a holistic solution that also includes paid management (namely, ads).As for whats coming next, Lui notes that Unified has been on the market for about a year now. He says that first year was about the proof of concept â€” while the second year is really about investment in the technology.
