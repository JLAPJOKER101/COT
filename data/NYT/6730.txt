Russia&rsquo;s Foreign Ministry attacked the human rights records of other countries in its first report on injustice elsewhere in the world, but it singled out the United States &mdash; offering examples like the Guant&aacute;namo Bay prison and wrongful murder convictions. &ldquo;The situation in the United States is a far cry from the ideals that Washington proclaims,&rdquo; said the report, released Wednesday. Moscow has previously reacted angrily when the State Department&rsquo;s annual reports have accused Russia of human rights breaches. The department has expressed concern about attacks on rights activists and journalists, most of which go unpunished.
