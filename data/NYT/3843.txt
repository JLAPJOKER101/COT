The Vatican and the predominantly Muslim nation of Malaysia established diplomatic relations on Monday, a sign that the Southeast Asian nation&rsquo;s government was opening to religious minorities after interfaith tensions had shaken the country&rsquo;s Catholic community. The Holy See announced the agreement after Pope Benedict XVI and high-ranking Vatican officials met with Prime Minister Najib Razak of Malaysia at Castel Gandolfo, the pope&rsquo;s summer residence outside Rome. In recent years, tensions have been high between Catholics, who make up about 3 percent of Malaysia&rsquo;s population, and the Malaysian government. Catholics have complained of vandalism against churches and the government&rsquo;s confiscation of Malay-language Bibles because of a ban on the use of &ldquo;Allah&rdquo; as a Malay-language translation for God.
