Security forces loyal to  Laurent Gbagbo, who is refusing to cede power, imposed a curfew on an opposition neighborhood on Wednesday, sending in a convoy of military trucks after two days of clashes. The residents of the neighborhood, Abobo, voted in large numbers for the opposition leader, Alassane Ouattara, whose victory in the Nov. 28 presidential election over Mr. Gbagbo has been recognized by the United Nations, the United States, the European Union and the African Union. Several civilians and  police officers have died in the clashes.
