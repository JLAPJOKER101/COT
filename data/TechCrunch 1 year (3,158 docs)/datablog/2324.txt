Exclusive - ZooZ, not to be confused with ZOOZ Mobile, has raised $1.5 million in funding in a seed round led by lool ventures (yes, thats really what theyre called).Other investors that participated in the financing round include Rhodium, Kima Ventures, Orefa Investment, Jaina Capital, A.M.

Heres how it works.Its worth noting that ZooZ is adamant about the fact that it has built its solution with security and fraud detection in mind, and stores all sensitive data in a PCI-compliant cloud environment.The ZooZ platform is being rolled out in an initial, six-month beta phase, during which the service will be completely free. After this period, ZooZ will be charging a nominal fee for processing payments.ZooZ was founded in 2010 by CEO Oren Levy and CTO Ronen Morecki and is based in Israel.
