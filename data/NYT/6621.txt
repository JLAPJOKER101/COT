A court has sentenced a democracy advocate to nine years in prison for inciting subversion. A lawyer, Liang Xiaojun, said that a court in southwestern China on Friday convicted Chen Wei of incitement to subversion over four essays he wrote and published online. Mr. Chen was detained in February amid an expansive government crackdown in response to anonymous online calls urging Chinese to imitate protests in North Africa and the Middle East. The sentence is the harshest known punishment meted out during this year&rsquo;s crackdown.
