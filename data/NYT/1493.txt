A new food safety scandal erupted in China this week, this time over pigs in central Henan Province that were fed an illegal additive believed to speed up muscle growth and burn fat, resulting in leaner pork. The banned additive, clenbuterol, is considered hazardous to people and can cause nausea, headaches, limb tremors and cancer, the Chinese media reported. Authorities said they were investigating more than 1,300 pig farms. The police have detained more than 14 people and at least 6 government officials or employees have been fired or suspended, according to media reports on Friday.
