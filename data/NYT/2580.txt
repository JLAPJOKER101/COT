Uganda&rsquo;s main opposition politician and recent protest leader was barred Wednesday from flying home after undergoing medical treatment in Kenya, Kenya Airways said. Kizza Besigye, left, who was being treated for injuries sustained during a recent arrest, was blocked from boarding a flight to Uganda after the airline said it was told by &ldquo;internal intelligence sources&rdquo; that the flight would not be allowed to land in Uganda with Mr. Besigye onboard. Uganda&rsquo;s minister of information, Kabakumba Matsiko, told Parliament that the government did not block Mr. Besigye&rsquo;s return, but that the former Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi was on the plane and did not want him on it, The Associated Press reported.
