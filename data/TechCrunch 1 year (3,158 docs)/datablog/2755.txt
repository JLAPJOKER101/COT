Location-based service Loopt is getting some nice promotion for the next three months, courtesy of San Franciscos International Airport and Virgin America. And it might make your trip to the airport a bit less expensive.Beginning this week, travelers going through SFOs new Terminal 2 will be able to check-in on Loopt to receive an offer from one of six businesses located within the terminal, including Kiehls and Natalies Candy Jar — as well as hefty discounts from Virgin America itself. The difference between this and most other check-in based offers is that the deal you receive is chosen randomly from one of these merchants (you just need to check-in at Terminal 2).The promotion is being coordinated by Virgin America and Loopt, but travelers flying on American (which is also based in Terminal 2 at SFO) will be able to score the check-in deals as well. Each of the participating merchants is deciding what they want to give away, and while some merchants in the terminal arent participating, Loopt says that they may well jump on board in the coming weeks.The catch? After installing and signing up for Loopt, youll need to watch a clip called A Day in the Life of SFOs T2 before you can see which offer youve received. It runs nearly three minutes long (which seems pretty hefty) and you have to watch the whole thing. But the video itself is well done, so its not a painful experience provided you arent late for a flight. If nothing else, its the first time Ive ever watched a commercial for an airport terminal.Loopt is going to be promoted to travelers through a variety of ways in the terminals: each of the businesses giving out deals will feature a sign, and the terminal itself will feature screens telling people to install the app and check-in.
