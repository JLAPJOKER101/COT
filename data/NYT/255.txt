The owner of a chain of jewelry stores lost about $50 million worth of paintings, diamonds and antiques in one of the more brazen recent thefts at country homes of the wealthy outside of Moscow. The burglars tied up security guards, retrieved keys from a caretaker&rsquo;s house and made off with paintings by the 19th-century Russian masters Ilya Repin, Ivan Shishkin and Ivan Aivazovsky, Russian television news reported. Their owner, Aleksandr Tarantsev,  said the paintings were insured.
