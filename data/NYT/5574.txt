Yuri M. Luzhkov, Moscow&rsquo;s former mayor, said Monday that he had been summoned for questioning in an embezzlement investigation of the Bank of Moscow, which is suspected of illegally funneling money into his wife&rsquo;s personal accounts. Mr. Luzhkov, who was fired last year after running afoul of the Kremlin, told the Interfax news agency that he was being singled out for criticizing the authorities in a recent radio interview. Investigators have accused the bank&rsquo;s former chief executive of illegally issuing a loan of more than $400 million to a shell company linked to Mr. Luzhkov&rsquo;s wife. The couple, who are currently outside Russia, have denied any wrongdoing, and no charges have been filed against them.
