Even though we still dont know when RIM will get around to launching it, CEO Thorsten Heins gave us a few brief glimpses at what BlackBerry 10 would be able to do during his keynote address at the BlackBerry World conference.But whats that? You missed the keynote? Well, just for you, heres the video that Heins played during his time on stage that shows off what the companys forthcoming mobile operating system could look like when it officially launches later this year.Now, theres plenty of time for RIM to change things before the operating system officially debuts on a BlackBerry smartphone, but the teaser video shows off a handsome, simple UI that I hope makes it into the final builds. How close the video actually comes to accurately depicting the current state of BlackBerry 10 is still up in the air though  the pre-release Dev Alpha device runs on a modified (not to mention stripped down) version of the PlayBook OS, and RIMs Vivek Bhardwaj wouldnt show off the newer software build on his own testing device when we visited RIM in Waterloo last week.Weve explored some of the features spotted in the video (like the keyboard) in a bit more depth too, so take a peek if you havent yet had your fill of BlackBerry 10s new tricks.
