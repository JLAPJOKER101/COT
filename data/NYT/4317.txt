In neighboring Kandahar Province, a gunman killed Rabia Sadat, an employee of the province&rsquo;s Work and Social Affairs Department, as she was getting into a car outside her home to go to work, said her father, Sayed Hussein Sadat. Also Tuesday, NATO said a cargo plane was slightly damaged but no one aboard was hurt when it collided with a surveillance drone in eastern Afghanistan on Monday. The drone went down and had not yet been located, NATO said.
