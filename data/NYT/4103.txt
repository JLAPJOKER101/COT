The United States Senate on Tuesday unanimously confirmed Earl Anthony Wayne as ambassador to Mexico. The former ambassador, Carlos Pascual, resigned in March after a public dispute with President Felipe Calder&oacute;n of Mexico over embassy documents released by WikiLeaks. The documents showed him and other American officials criticizing Mexican authorities for their performance in the country&rsquo;s drug war. Mr. Wayne, a career diplomat, previously served as deputy ambassador to Afghanistan.
