The head of the United Nations nuclear watchdog agency, Yukiya Amano, left, said Monday that he could not guarantee that Iran was not trying to develop atomic arms. He also said that Iran might have worked on a nuclear arms program later than 2004, indirectly contradicting a public American intelligence estimate, and that Iran was refusing to cooperate with the agency&rsquo;s investigation of Iran&rsquo;s nuclear program.
