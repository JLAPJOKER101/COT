If theres one thing wrong with Google+ its a lack of a real non-browser interface. There are workarounds and widgets, but theres never been a real way to pull your G+ feed into a more comfortable format. While many would complain that RSS isnt even close to a comfortable format, its bettern nuffin.That said, a new free service called GPlusRSS allows you to create a public RSS feed of your G+ account. You can potentially share this feed with others (heres mine) or you can keep it for yourself. The feed consists only of public pronouncements so private messages wont show up.The service is also useful for propagating your G+ info to other services using systems like dlvr.it or something like WPRSSPoster to bring your G+ content to WordPress.

It may not be much but its definitely a way to get your goods out of Googles walled G+ garden. Maybe (just maybe?) Ill start using G+ a bit more because of this?
