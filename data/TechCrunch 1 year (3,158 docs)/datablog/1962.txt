Were all familiar with the pain of having to share photos with people. Im not talking about the staff party album on Facebook, Im talking about moments that matter  the family holidays, the weddings, big days like those. And this remains an ongoing issue. We can share Dropbox folders all we like. Everything still has to be downloaded and the interface does not suit viewing, especially on tablets. We can ask friends and family to sign up to a private Flickr group, but thats still another hurdle. Lots of photo and file sharing services are rubbish and many people remain afraid of Facebooks now quite public nature. Now, a new startup out of Berlin has come up with something it calls the Dropbox for photos where you can privately exchange photos in a group: 7moments.
