Officials in Chile have approved a huge hydroelectric project in the heart of Patagonia, setting off protests by environmentalists in several cities. The Environmental Assessment Commission of Coyhaique, a regional government commission in southern Chile, approved on Monday the $3.2 billion project, which involves a series of five dams in the sparsely populated region of Ays&eacute;n, which is dotted with nature reserves. Government officials say the HidroAys&eacute;n project is needed to help stave off an energy squeeze in Chile, which imports about 70 percent of its energy. Environmentalists say it will flood thousands of acres of largely undeveloped territory and damage ranching and tourism. The police arrested at least 60 people late Monday in Santiago at a downtown protest that attracted thousands. Hundreds of demonstrators also took to the streets in at least four other Chilean cities. Opponents, including some members of Chile&rsquo;s Congress, said Tuesday that they would appeal in court, while opposition legislators said they would request a congressional investigation into irregularities in the project&rsquo;s approval.
