About 200 Taliban fighters attacked a police outpost in the mountainous province of Nuristan in eastern Afghanistan on Tuesday in one of the first attacks of this year&rsquo;s &ldquo;spring offensive.&rdquo; Two insurgents were killed and three members of the Afghan security forces were wounded in a gunfight lasting several hours, officials said. The attack followed a siege in the southern city of Kandahar over the weekend during which the Taliban unleashed multiple attacks with small arms and suicide bombers. American and Afghan commanders have warned of renewed violence as insurgents push back after NATO-led troops made gains with offensives mainly in the Taliban heartland in the south. Afghan and foreign troops, however, have less control over more remote areas in provinces like Nuristan and Kunar in the east near the border with Pakistan.
