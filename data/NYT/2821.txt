KABUL, Afghanistan &mdash; At least 10 Afghan laborers on their way to work in southern Afghanistan were killed by a roadside bomb on Tuesday, a local official said.        

Fazaludin Agha, governor of the Panjwai District in Kandahar Province, said the workers were in a truck taking them to their job when it was hit by the bomb in Sperwan village. In addition to the dead, 28 workers were wounded, he said. A police official put the number of dead at 11.        

The workers, who survivors said earned about $4 a day, were on their way to work at a Canadian-financed road project in the district.        

Taliban officials have in the past said that they consider foreign aid projects legitimate targets and have warned that they will kill civilians working on them.        

Tuesday&rsquo;s roadside bombing is the latest in a string of attacks by militants across the country.        

On Monday, NATO said four of its service members were killed in eastern Afghanistan by an explosion, providing no further details. A suicide bomber blew himself up in Qala-e-Najeel in the northeastern province of Laghman, killing four civilians and wounding more than a dozen others. Six people were killed on Sunday after insurgents stormed a police compound in Khost Province in eastern Afghanistan and battled Afghan and NATO forces for several hours before the coalition regained control of it.        

On Saturday, a suicide bomber believed to be wearing an army uniform blew himself up in a tent on the grounds of the national military hospital in the capital, Kabul, killing six people and wounding more than 20. Five people were arrested in connection with that attack.
