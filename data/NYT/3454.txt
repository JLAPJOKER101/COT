Missile strikes from two American drones killed at least 21 people suspected of being militants in South Waziristan on Monday, Pakistani officials said, part of an intensified American assault in the tribal belt this month. In the first strike, a missile hit a moving vehicle in Ghalmandi Panga Village on the Afghan border, killing 8. A few hours later, another drone fired three missiles into a militant training center in Mantoi town, about 18 miles north of Wana, killing 13.
