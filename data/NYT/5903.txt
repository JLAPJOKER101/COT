BEIJING &mdash; After a hard day&rsquo;s labor, your average upscale Beijinger likes nothing more than to shuck his dress shoes for a pair of Enduring and Persevering, rev up his Precious Horse and head to the pub for a tall, frosty glass of Happiness Power.        

Or, if he&rsquo;s a teetotaler, a bottle of Tasty Fun.        

To Westerners, that&rsquo;s Nike, BMW, Heineken and Coca-Cola, respectively. And those who wish to snicker should feel free: the companies behind these names are laughing too &mdash; all the way to the bank.        

More than many nations, China is a place where names are imbued with deep significance. Western companies looking to bring their products to China face a problem not unlike that of Chinese parents naming a baby boy: little Gang (&ldquo;strong&rdquo;) may be regarded quite differently than little Yun (&ldquo;cloud&rdquo;). Given that China&rsquo;s market for consumer goods is growing by better than 13 percent annually &mdash; and luxury-goods sales by 25 percent &mdash; an off-key name could have serious financial consequences.        

And so the art of picking a brand name that resonates with Chinese consumers is no longer an art. It has become a sort of science, with consultants, computer programs and linguistic analyses to ensure that what tickles a Mandarin ear does not grate on a Cantonese one.        

Art &ldquo;is only a very, very tiny piece of it,&rdquo; said Vladimir Djurovic, president of the Labbrand Consulting Company in Shanghai, which has made a business of finding names for Western companies entering the Chinese market.        

Maybe. But there is a lot of artistry in the best of the West.        

The paradigm probably is the Chinese name for Coca-Cola, Kekoukele, which not only sounds like Coke&rsquo;s English name, but conveys its essence of taste and fun in a way that the original name could not hope to match.        

There are many others. Consider Tide detergent, Taizi, whose Chinese characters literally mean &ldquo;gets rid of dirt.&rdquo; (Characters are important: the same sound written differently could mean &ldquo;too purple.&rdquo;)        

There is also Reebok, or Rui bu, which means &ldquo;quick steps.&rdquo; And Colgate &mdash; Gao lu jie &mdash; which translates into &ldquo;revealing superior cleanliness.&rdquo; And Lay&rsquo;s snack foods &mdash; Le shi &mdash; whose name means &ldquo;happy things.&rdquo; Nike (Nai ke) and BMW (Bao Ma, echoing the first two sounds of its English and German names) also have worn well on Chinese ears.        

Still, finding a good name involves more than coming up with clever homonyms to the original English.        

&ldquo;Do you want to translate your name, or come up with a Chinese brand?&rdquo; said Monica Lee, the managing director of the Brand Union, a Beijing consultancy. &ldquo;If you go for phonetic sounds, everyone knows where you are from &mdash; you&rsquo;re immediately identified as a foreign brand.&rdquo;        

For some products, having a foreign-sounding name lends a cachet that a true Chinese name would lack. Many upscale brands like Cadillac (Ka di la ke), or Hilton (Xi er dun), employ phonetic translations that mean nothing in Chinese. Rolls-Royce (Laosi-Laisi) includes two Chinese characters for &ldquo;labor&rdquo; and &ldquo;plants&rdquo; that more or less have become standard usage in foreign names &mdash; all to achieve a distinct foreign look and sound.        

But on the other hand, a genuine Chinese name can say things about a product that a mere collection of homonyms never could. Take Citibank, Hua qi yinhang, which literally means &ldquo;star-spangled banner bank,&rdquo; or Marriott, Wan hao, or &ldquo;10,000 wealthy elites.&rdquo; Or Pentium, Ben teng, which means &ldquo;galloping.&rdquo; Asked to introduce Marvel comics to China, the Labbrand consultants came up not long ago with &ldquo;Man wei&rdquo; &mdash; roughly phonetic, foreign-sounding and eminently suited to superheroes with the meaning &ldquo;comic power.&rdquo;
