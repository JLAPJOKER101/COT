As if this whole Steve Jobs biography thing couldnt get more drawn out and dramatic, users  including Jeff Jarvis and Jason Kottke  are reporting early deliveries of Walter Isaacsons highly anticipated book, oddly enough through pre-orders on the Amazon Kindle. This leaves Apple fans with quite a conundrum; Watch the 60 Minutes Issaacon interview now or read his book first?Before you get too Amazon trigger happy, I just tried to order one via Kindle and it has not yet shown up  so maybe its first come first served?Update: My copy on the Kindle just arrived, 15 minutes after I ordered it. And, as is fitting, the book  including a free sample  is now available for the iPhone and iPad in iBooks, with zero wait.The analog version of the 656 page book should be officially available in bookstores across the US tomorrow.Image via/ Johnnie Manzari
