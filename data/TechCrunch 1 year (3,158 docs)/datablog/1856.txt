The PC industry is in decline. Or hadnt you noticed? According to Gartner, PC shipments in the U.S slipped 5.9 percent in the fourth quarter of 2011. (Microsoft also warned earlier this week that Q4 PC shipments were down). The only bright spot seems to be Apple, which grew shipments in the U.S. an estimated 20.7 percent.  That makes Apple The No. 3 PC maker in the U.S.HP and Dell are No. 1 and No. 2 respectively. They still command twice Apples 11.6 percent market share, with 23.1 percent share for HP and 22.4 percent share for Dell. But Apple is the only PC manufacturer in the top 5 that is growing. Halo effect, anyone?  Or maybe its the stores. The only PC manufacturer which grew faster in the U.S than Apple was Lenovo, which grew 40 percent. But it didnt sell enough PCs in the U.S. to crack the top 5.Worldiwde, PC shipments fell an estimated 1.4 percent worldwide. Apple didnt make it into the top 5 worldwide  HP was still No. 1, but saw a 16 percent decline. Lenovo came in No. 2, with 23 percent growth. Dell is No. 3 worldwide.
