Everyone is focused on what hardware product Apple might launch next, but out of Italy comes reported news of a software development: the company has bought Redmatica, a small startup that specializes in digital music-editing apps.The news was reported by the Italian blog Fanpage, which also did some sleuthing to dig up a document from the Italian communications regulator AGCOM that seems to prove it  although we have also reached out to Apple for direct confirmation.Redmatica specializes in developing and selling software for digital music editing.Its main product is a piece of software called Keymap Pro (screen shot pictured here) an editor for sampled instruments, but its site lists four products in total  all designed to run on the Mac.Apple, meanwhile, has its own musician-focused software, in the form of Logic Pro (and the hugely popular GarageBand for more casual and/or poor music makers).It may be that Apple is looking at an aqui-hire situation to help beef up those offerings, or to incorporate some of that software into its existing products.Fanpage notes that revenues at Redmatica were at less than €100,000 per year, with income of €26,000.We have contacted Apple for confirmation of this deal and will update as we learn more.
