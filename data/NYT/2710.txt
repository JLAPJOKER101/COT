A security court has sentenced a prominent Shiite cleric and eight others to 20 years in prison for kidnapping a police officer. The sentences were announced by the state-run Bahrain News Agency on Thursday, during the crackdown by the ruling Sunni dynasty against Shiite-led protesters. The prominent cleric who was sentenced, Muhammad Habib al-Saffaf, is known to his followers as Sheik Muhammad Habib al-Moqdad.
