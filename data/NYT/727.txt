Hundreds of Islamic hard-liners stormed a courthouse and set two churches on fire in central Java on Tuesday to protest what they considered a lenient sentence for a Christian convicted of blaspheming Islam. Witnesses said that at least nine people were hospitalized. The Christian, Antonius Richmond Bawengan, was found guilty of distributing books and leaflets that &ldquo;spread hatred about Islam&rdquo; and was sentenced to five years in prison, the maximum term.
