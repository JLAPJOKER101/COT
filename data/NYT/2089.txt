Anti-riot police officers clashed with student protesters at Uganda&rsquo;s most prestigious university Friday as students demonstrated against tuition increases and widespread government corruption. Students at Makerere University threw stones at the police and burned kiosks as officers shot rubber bullets and threw tear-gas canisters, above, into dormitories and fleeing crowds. The protest began over a report that university administrators planned to double the tuition, which the administration denied, but turned into a protest against President Yoweri Museveni. There have been several small protests over the last week against rising prices and corruption. Protests were also reported in the west on Friday. On Thursday, a former presidential candidate and leading opposition figure, Kizza Besigye, was shot during street demonstrations in Kampala, the capital.
