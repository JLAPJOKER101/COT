President Blaise Compaor&eacute; said Friday that government soldiers had promised to end a rash of violent protests that had raised fears of instability and threatened his 24-year rule. After a two-hour meeting with representatives of the armed forces, Mr. Compaor&eacute; said he had promised to improve the military&rsquo;s housing, clothing and food allowances, issues that led to the protests. The military, he said, &ldquo;promised to end the indiscipline that these soldiers have shown lately.&rdquo;
