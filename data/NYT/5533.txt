UNITED NATIONS (AP) &mdash; The United Nations Security Council called on Friday for President Ali Abdullah Saleh of Yemen to immediately accept an arrangement to transfer power to his deputy and end the escalating violence in his nation.        

The Council unanimously adopted a resolution expressing serious concern at the deteriorating security, economic and humanitarian situation in Yemen &ldquo;due to the lack of progress on a political settlement and the potential for the further escalation of violence.&rdquo;        

Mr. Saleh has for months declined to move forward on a plan proposed by Saudi Arabia and five other countries in the Persian Gulf region, and supported by the United States, to step down and hand over power to his deputy, in exchange for immunity from prosecution. He is accused by many Yemenis of pushing the country toward civil war by clinging to power despite protests, the defection to the opposition of important tribal and military allies, and mounting international pressure to step down.
