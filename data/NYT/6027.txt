Former Prime Minister Yulia V. Tymoshenko asked international medical organizations on Friday to help examine and treat her worsening health conditions. Ms. Tymoshenko, who is serving a seven-year jail sentence on charges widely seen as politically motivated, says she is suffering from severe back pain and from mysterious bruises on her body. She says she does not trust government-appointed doctors and has accused the authorities of refusing to let her see independent doctors. &ldquo;Tymoshenko&rsquo;s life is in danger,&rdquo; said Oleksandr Turchynov, her top aide. &ldquo;A sick person is being tortured.&rdquo;
