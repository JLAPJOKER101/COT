Although most of the Hackathon Hackers escaped before we could interview them, we corralled two interesting groups backstage and asked them about their products and experience at TechCrunch Disrupt Beijing. First we had Tianji Connect, an interface to the local LinkedIn clone that allows you to look up anyone on the Internet and see their experience and skills.Next, we talked to Shareware, a project that could potentially fixed TechCrunch in China. This projected replaces blocked social networks with their local equivalents, cutting out Twitter where Wiebo is only supported, for example.In all, these were some amazing projects and Im glad the teams took the task seriously and the brought loads of skill and experience to the table. Impressive stuff.
