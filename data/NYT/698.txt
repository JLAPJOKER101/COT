LONDON (Reuters) &mdash; The Chechen rebel leader Doku Umarov said Monday that he had ordered the suicide bombing that killed 36 people at Russia&rsquo;s busiest airport last month.        

Mr. Umarov, 46, speaking in a video posted on an Islamist Web site, described the attack on the Domodedovo airport in Moscow on Jan. 24 as a &ldquo;special operation&rdquo; directed against the Russian people and the prime minister, Vladimir V. Putin.        

He said there would be further attacks in pursuit of an independent Muslim state in Russia&rsquo;s Caucasus region, an area embracing Chechnya, Dagestan and other nearby territories.        

He appeared in the video, made on the day of the attack, wearing combat fatigues.        

Mr. Umarov, who has promised Russians that &ldquo;the war will come to your streets,&rdquo; also claimed to have ordered the suicide bombing that killed more than 40 people in the Moscow subway in March, and the bombing of a luxury train, the Nevsky Express, which killed 28 in November 2009.
