KLEINMACHNOW, GERMANY &mdash; They are called &ldquo;Wutb&uuml;rger.&rdquo; And they have become the bane of every political party in Germany.        

Loosely translated as &ldquo;enraged citizen,&rdquo; the Wutb&uuml;rger has stepped outside the classical political and parliamentary system by organizing demonstrations and town-hall meetings, protest marches and sit-ins.        

&ldquo;It&rsquo;s as if the post-1945 consensus of Germans accepting the status quo and the conventional structures of the main political parties is coming to an end,&rdquo; said Andrea R&ouml;mmele, a professor at the Hertie School of Governance in Berlin. &ldquo;These new trends should be seen as a strength, not as a threat to democracy,&rdquo; she added.        

The past several months have seen an extraordinary swelling of spontaneous civil society movements that have jolted the political parties.        

&ldquo;There is no doubt about it,&rdquo; said Wolfgang Bosbach, a leading Christian Democrat lawmaker. &ldquo;We are concerned.&rdquo;        

&ldquo;You have all kinds of protest movements springing up all over the place,&rdquo; Mr. Bosbach continued. &ldquo;They consist mostly of educated people who are neither left-wing nor right-wing but somewhere in the middle of the political spectrum. We should be worried. We should be reaching out to them.&rdquo;        

In Stuttgart, the regional capital of Baden-W&uuml;rttemberg, tens of thousands of citizens have protested the construction of a new railroad station, Stuttgart 21, that would serve as a hub for fast connections between German cities and Paris.        

Those protests caught all the political parties off guard, especially the Christian Democrats, the governing party at the time.        

Partly as a result, during regional elections in March, voters ended the party&rsquo;s 58-year rule by electing the Greens, who for the first time in Germany will head a state government. The new premier, Winfried Kretschmann, has promised to hold a referendum on the future of Stuttgart 21.        

On the other side of Germany, near Berlin, thousands of residents in Kleinmachnow have been holding demonstrations against the capital&rsquo;s new international airport, which is scheduled to open next year at Sch&ouml;nefeld.        

&ldquo;These demonstrations here are very focused,&rdquo; said Antonia Akmann, a resident of Kleinmachnow, a quiet suburb that has become popular for parents with young families. &ldquo;They are about defending our interests. If the planes fly over here, the value of property will decline. That is why so many people join these demonstrations.&rdquo;        

Further north, locals in the eastern state of Brandenburg have marched successfully against plans by the army to continue using a huge military base for practice shooting.        

And all over the country, there are protests against nuclear energy, including many thousands who are trying to prevent the transport by rail of nuclear waste from France to a storage site at Gorleben in central Germany.        

This phenomenon of the angry or even enraged citizen has become so entrenched that the German Language Society in December named &ldquo;Wutb&uuml;rger&rdquo; word of the year for 2010.        

&ldquo;The word reflects a particular mood,&rdquo; said Andrea-Eva Ewels, managing director of the German Language Society, which was established in the late 1940s to oversee the development of the language. Each year, it finds and documents new words entering the German language. And each year, it selects a winner.        

&ldquo;In the case of the Wutb&uuml;rger, the citizens feel that the political decisions are made over their heads,&rdquo; Ms. Ewels said. &ldquo;It has created a kind of frustration, or anger. You can see it from the spate of protests over the past year.&rdquo;        

In Germany, the late 1960s and 1970s saw the rebellion of students and the emergence of the anti-nuclear and peace movement that eventually led to the establishment of the Greens. Then there was the violent anti-capitalist Baader-Meinhof group, which became the terrorist Red Army Faction that eventually gave up its struggle for lack of support.        

&ldquo;But the Wutb&uuml;rger phenomenon is different,&rdquo; said Ms. R&ouml;mmele, of the Hertie School of Governance.        

The 1960s movements were generally left-wing student rebellions focused on one or two issues, Ms. R&ouml;mmele said.

&ldquo;The Wutb&uuml;rgers are not ideological as such,&rdquo; she added. &ldquo;They are educated people who are against a certain style of politics in which the political parties have failed to create a platform for citizens&rsquo; discussions.&rdquo;        

The citizen&rsquo;s sense of alienation from the political parties is reflected in the increasingly low turnout in both federal and regional elections.        

&ldquo;Over the past 20 years or so, you have seen here, but in other European countries too, a trend toward de-politicization,&rdquo; said Harald Welzer, a political sociologist at the Institute for Advanced Study in the Humanities in Essen. &ldquo;The citizens feel isolated from the parties.&rdquo;        

One main reason is that the traditional ties forged by the Christian Democrats and Social Democrats are all but broken. In the past, they could communicate policy at gatherings after church services, at trade union and miners&rsquo; festivals, at annual holiday celebrations. With the fall in church attendance, the decline of traditional industrial areas and the morphing nature of the modern work world, the parties have lost contact with the grass roots.        

&ldquo;The parties are out of touch with the changing democratic needs of the 21st century,&rdquo; said Gero Neugebauer, a political science professor at the Free University in Berlin. &ldquo;The issues are now so complex, ranging from debts and immigration to climate change and energy policy that government and civil society will have to work much more closely in reaching consensus over these issues.&rdquo;        

Mr. Bosbach, the Christian Democrat lawmaker, admits his party could do much more to get policy across.        

&ldquo;We have to make a big effort, especially if we want people to become active in politics and not just in the Wutb&uuml;rger movements,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all very well demonstrating but you have to take responsibility for your actions.&rdquo;        

Ms. R&ouml;mmele says regular local and national elections no longer confer democratic legitimacy.        

&ldquo;You need a double legitimacy: the traditional parliamentary system of top down but also a parallel way, of bottom up, that will involve citizens,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The problem is that the parties are not structured to provide such discussions or deal with civil society. It is not part of their culture.&rdquo;        

Chancellor Angela Merkel&rsquo;s Christian Democratic Union and the Social Democrats have been slow to introduce town-hall meetings. This is despite the fact that Mrs. Merkel&rsquo;s own democratic experiences were rooted in the civil society movements that blossomed in the former East Germany during 1989, only to give way to the established political parties.        

The Social Democrats said they are trying to respond.        

&ldquo;We do have a dialogue with the Wutb&uuml;rger movements,&rdquo; said Anni Betz, deputy manager of the Social Democrats in Baden-W&uuml;rttemberg. &ldquo;The new Green-Social Democratic government here in Stuttgart made a specific reference in the coalition treaty to involving more of the citizens in decision-making.&rdquo;        

It could mean that decisions, already hobbled by heavy bureaucracy, could take just a bit longer, Ms. R&ouml;mmele said, &ldquo;but you will get a stronger and more vibrant democracy.&rdquo;
