SANA, Yemen (AP) &mdash; A strike by an American drone on Wednesday killed five militants connected with Al Qaeda in southern Yemen, officials said.        

A Yemeni official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to comply with military rules, said the drone attacked militant hide-outs in an area east of the city of Zinjibar, the capital of Abyan Province. Islamic fighters seized control of the city in May, taking advantage of the uprising against President Ali Abdullah Saleh, but military forces have since fought their way back into the city.
