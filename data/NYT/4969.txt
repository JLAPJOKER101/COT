The autobiography of the WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange will be released on Thursday, despite his withdrawing cooperation for the book, his British publisher said Wednesday. The publication of &ldquo;Julian Assange: The Unauthorized Autobiography&rdquo; follows a contentious battle, according to a statement from the publisher, Canongate Books. Mr. Assange said last December that he had reluctantly signed a book deal worth as much as $1.7 million. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to write this book, but I have to,&rdquo; he told reporters, citing a costly continuing legal battle to avoid extradition to Sweden from Britain to face allegations of sexual abuse there. According to the Canongate statement, Mr. Assange gave 50 hours of interviews to a writer enlisted to help him. But when he saw the first draft of the book in March, he declared &ldquo;All memoir is prostitution,&rdquo; and sought to cancel the contract. In New York, Alfred A. Knopf canceled its contract for the Assange memoir.
