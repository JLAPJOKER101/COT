The Samsung Galaxy S III continues to be one of the hottest Android phones weve ever seen. When I reviewed the phone, I said flat out that this is the phone youve been waiting for. And after John and I got another good look during an episode of Fly Or Die, we both gave the Galaxy S III a Fly. But one thing we havent really addressed is durability, which is why we thought you might want to take a look at this drop test by Gizmo Slip. Spoiler Alert: Ill now be talking about the results of the video, so jump past the break if you want to watch before reading. There isnt a whole lot of good news to share after watching this drop test go down. The Galaxy S III almost survived unscathed from the first drop, a four-foot fall on its back. Unfortunately, the glass of the camera cracked as the 8-megapixel rear camera tends to jut out the phone a bit. The second fall, however, is where things really start to devolve. A corner drop from four feet totally destroyed the corner of the phone and sent a crack all the way from the bottom right corner of the phone to the top left corner of the screen. For funsies, Gizmo Slip dropped the phone one more time from four feet on its face. That didnt actually cause much damage, except for a little more scratching on the corner. I said it before and Ill say it again: a phone of this caliber shouldnt be made of plastic. It was my one big complaint when the Galaxy S III was released, though Im sure there are reasons for a plastic paneling. Either way, however, the plastic didnt do much to protect the beastly phone, so if youre a new or future owner, be sure to pick yourself up a case and be careful.
