Whens the last time you really splurged on something for your bike? The old girl gets you around town, puts up with your ridiculous maintenance regimens, and shifts and rattles in just the right way to get you up and down the hills of your borough. Why not show her you love her and, thanks to Blinksteady, put a ring on it.The Blinksteady is the worlds smartest bike light (citation needed). It turns on when its dark and turns itself off when your bike is stopped. You no longer have to reach back to turn on your light when dusk turns to night and, better still, you never have to risk being hit by a nightblind SUV driver in some deserted late-night cul-de-sac.The biggest issue? Price. This honker is $95, which makes it worth more than my bike. However, its made of milled aluminum and its completely self-contained. Plus you never have to take it off because its secured to your seat post.Dont want to spend so much? Dont you worry. $30 gets you:
