A Paris court on Wednesday approved the extradition of Panama&rsquo;s onetime dictator, Manuel Antonio Noriega, left, to his homeland, clearing the way for his return after two decades in French and American prisons. Prime Minister Fran&ccedil;ois Fillon of France signed an extradition order for Mr. Noriega, 77, earlier this year, but a date of departure has not been determined, officials said. Panamanian courts have convicted Mr. Noriega in absentia in connection with the killing of political opponents, as well as on charges of embezzlement and corruption. He faces three 20-year prison terms in Panama, which he ruled from 1983 until 1989, when he was ousted by an American invasion. Convicted in a United States court in 1992 on charges including drug trafficking, Mr. Noriega was imprisoned in Florida before his extradition to France last year. A French judge sentenced him to seven years in prison on charges that he laundered $3 million in Colombian drug money through international banks and into French accounts in the late 1980s. The Panamanian president, Ricardo Martinelli, has vowed that Mr. Noriega will serve his Panamanian sentences in prison, and not under house arrest, despite his age and reported ill health, according to The Associated Press. The A.P. also quoted Mr. Noriega as telling the court through an interpreter: &ldquo;I want to return to Panama and prove my innocence.&rdquo;
