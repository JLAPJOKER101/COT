Rovio has just released an awesome new update to its latest game in the Angry Birds series, Angry Birds Space.The update brings with it a brand new Space Egg character, along with the return of Orange Bird, post-Super Hero makeover. Past that, youll also get access to 20 new levels and 10 new bonus levels. And if that werent enough, Rovio has added a new boss fight into the mix for serious bird-slingers.Perhaps more interesting than the update is the appearance of a new image on Rovios Facebook page.It shows a pig surrounded by blocks and planks, with three though bubbles for how those pieces of debris could be arranged. The caption reads, decisions, decisions.Considering the fact that Rovios latest release, Amazing Alex, has its own level editors, many speculate that this may be Rovios teaser for an Angry Birds level editor, in which you could arrange the levels and then bust em to pieces.We reached out to Rovio about the level editor teaser, and as we expected, they wouldnt comment on rumors. (Which they started by posting this photo.)Heres the wording:As a matter of company policy, we dont comment on rumors.In any case, Id keep your eyes peeled for a level editor. Rovio has mastered the teaser, as proven with the hype leading up to Angry Birds Space.Oh, and if you want to check out the Space update, take a gander at the video below.
