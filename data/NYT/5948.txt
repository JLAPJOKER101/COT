Anders Behring Breivik, an avowed anti-immigrant extremist who has admitted to killing 77 people in a rampage in Norway last summer, appeared at his first public court hearing in Oslo on Monday, declaring himself &ldquo;a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement.&rdquo; It was the first time victims and families of those killed in the shooting spree at a youth camp on Utoya Island were permitted in the courtroom with Mr. Breivik, left. At one point Mr. Breivik asked permission to address survivors, but the judge refused. The judge turned down a request by defense lawyers to move Mr. Breivik from solitary confinement, but ruled that he should be allowed access to newspapers, television and other media starting Dec. 12.
