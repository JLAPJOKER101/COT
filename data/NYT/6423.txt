At least 15 primary school students were killed when the bus taking them home overturned, renewing safety concerns after a similar accident last month. Eight other children were injured, a spokesman for the Jiangsu provincial government said Tuesday. The accident occurred Monday on a rural highway outside Xuzhou, in Jiangsu Province. News reports said the bus careened off the road after swerving to avoid another vehicle. Xinhua News Agency said 29 students were on board the bus at the time. After an overcrowded van crashed killing 19 students and two adults last month, Prime Minister Wen Jiabao pledged that new rules on school bus safety would be drafted within a month.
