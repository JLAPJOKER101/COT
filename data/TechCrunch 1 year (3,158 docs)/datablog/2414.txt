The pending launch date of the next Google phone, Samsungs Galaxy Nexus, has been a bit of a mystery up until now. November has always been a sure thing, but when exactly wed be able to get up close and personal was as yet unknown. However, Droid-Life seems to have stumbled upon a Verizon roadmap, which should give us a clear peek at the Nexus availability, as well as that of couple other forthcoming phones. Lets take a look, shall we? According to the leaked image (below), availability for the Samsung Galaxy Nexus will begin on November 21, four days after the international launch. Were still unsure whether or not this handset will only be available online as its forefather the Nexus One was, but that w/o seems to suggest a web only launch. Luckily, this bad boy will be on sale through Black Friday, which falls on November 25 this year. The roadmap also outlines availability for a few other special devices, including the duo of new XOOM tablets we heard about last week (launching on November 30), as well as the Samsung Illusion and the BlackBerry Curve 9370, both of which will hit shelves on November 17.
