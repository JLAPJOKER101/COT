Think back to the last time you put together a PowerPoint presentation. Try not to shudder.If youre like me, you probably had a few moments when you wondered if the slide you were working on made sense — or if it was even worth including at all. You may have turned to a coworker to get their opinion, but they didnt have any context about the rest of the presentation and were eager to get to lunch, so their input probably wasnt a big help.If this sounds familiar, then a nifty new app called Reel may be just what you need. Its the latest app to come from interaction design firm ZURB, and it lets you get near-instant feedback on every slide or photo in your presentation.The app is super-simple, which is sort of the point. Upload an image, PDF, or PowerPoint file, and the app will convert it into an online slideshow thats also viewable in mobile browsers. Thats not exactly unique, but Reel has a nifty trick: itll let you leave a comment beneath each slide, where you can explain what youll be saying on stage when the slide is shown. Your friends (or Twitter followers) can then vote as to whether they like the slide using a Thumbs Up or Thumbs Down, so you can quickly figure out what works, and what doesnt. You can find an example right here.ZURB isnt planning to charge for the app (this seems like a good way for them to get publicity). Their past projects include Verify, an app that lets you get feedback on your site design while its still in mockup form.
