Rebel tribesmen in a mountainous region just north of Yemen&rsquo;s capital, Sana, shot down a military aircraft on Wednesday, the Defense Ministry said. The Soviet-era plane crashed as it was &ldquo;carrying out a routine task this morning,&rdquo; according to the statement, which was published on a Web site run by the ministry. Northern tribesmen loyal to opponents of President Ali Abdullah Saleh have been battling government forces in the area since March, when they prevented a brigade of Republican Guards, a division of the armed forces led by Mr. Saleh&rsquo;s son, from entering the capital.
