One of the most popular Disrupt sessions is Paul Grahams Office Hours. (See video below). We are bringing it back to Disrupt SF on Monday, September 12th. If you are attending Disrupt and would like to be considered, be sure you fill out the form below and fill it out soon. Applications are going to close this Saturday, September 10th, at midnight PDT. We will consult with Graham to select the best candidates, based on which ones can get the most out of the interaction onstage and will provide insightful lessons for the audience.  At the start of the session, Paul will select five companies from those finalists. All finalists need to be prepared and ready to walk on stage immediately.Get your applications in now!
