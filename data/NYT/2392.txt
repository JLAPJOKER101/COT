The Vatican ousted an Australian bishop on Monday who had called on the church to consider ordaining women and married men. In a statement, the Vatican said that it had &ldquo;removed from pastoral care&rdquo; Bishop William Morris, left, the bishop of Toowoomba, Australia. The statement was particularly strong; normally the Vatican urges bishops to resign and then announces that it has accepted their resignation. Australian media reported that Bishop Morris had recently published an open letter saying that he was being removed for having argued in 2006 that the church should consider ordaining women and married men in order to fight a shortage of priests, prompting Pope Benedict XVI to open an investigation into his diocese. In the letter, Bishop Morris said he that he refused to resign, but would take early retirement because the pope had decided &ldquo;that the diocese would be better served by the leadership of a new bishop.&rdquo;
