What kind of person clicks on ads? When I talk to ad companies, theres a lot of discussion about how ads are supposed to be relevant, targeted based on user intent, and so on, but Ive never entirely shaken the suspicion that the real answer is: Suckers.That suspicion? A company called Criteo just released some research saying its pretty much a myth. Keep in mind that Criteo offers ad retargeting for e-commerce sites (which usually means targeting ads at people who visited a site but left without making or completing their purchase), so its not exactly surprising that the company would make this argument. On the other hand, the research is supposedly based on the 147 million unique browsers who saw a Criteo retargeted ad in the first seven days of March, so theres some real data here.Specifically, Criteo is disputing what it calls the myths about people who click on ads, as embodied by a 2008 comScore whitepaper called How Online Advertising Works: Whither The Click? Criteo argues that clickers are actually much more valuable than most folks in the industry think.You can read the full paper embedded below, but heres a quick summary of the myths (in bold), followed by Criteos refutation.Are you convinced? Well, you might be thinking that Criteo is looking at a relatively narrow slice of the audience, so its hard to generalize. In fact, thats almost Criteos point — its not saying that all clickers are valuable, but that clickers on the right kinds of ads are more valuable than you think:Nothing here should be taken to cast doubt on comScore’s original paper, which was based on the performance of low-CTR, branding-oriented advertising. However, the clear message is that their lessons cannot be applied to properly-executed performance display advertising.
