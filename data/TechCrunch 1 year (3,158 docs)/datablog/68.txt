Mozilla currently occupies the seventh and part of the third floor of the Hills Brothers Building at 2 Harrison St. and will expand to include the first two floors.We are targeting early 2013 to move into the space, and our overall space plan ties to our overall growth plans, Mozilla CFO Jim Cook tells me. This space should serve our needs well for the next few years.Mozillas nearby Mountain View office will remain at its current size, as the San Francisco office will swell from new hires. Cook says the new hires will support the growth of a number of Mozilla teams, including product development and product management teams.Mozilla says the new space will have open desks for contributors and a community space for events and meetups as the nonprofit relies on volunteers as well as paid staff.We are excited to see the growth of Mozilla’s office and activities in San Francisco, said San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee in a statement. My goal remains clearto ensure San Francisco remains the Innovation Capital of the World by attracting high-growth, innovative, community oriented companies such as Mozilla  organizations that are staying here and growing here.”
