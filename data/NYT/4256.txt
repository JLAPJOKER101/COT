One of China&rsquo;s high-speed train manufacturers, the CNR Corporation, announced Friday that it was recalling 54 of its trains from the Beijing to Shanghai route to test sensors that may be causing the trains to stop unnecessarily, such as when a passenger lights a cigarette in a restroom. The Rail Ministry announced separately Thursday that the number of high-speed trains each day between Beijing and Shanghai would be reduced to 66 in each direction starting next Tuesday, from 88 in each direction now. The moves, coming after the government announced a safety review of high-speed rail on Wednesday, seemed to reflect heightened concern after a deadly high-speed rail crash last month.
