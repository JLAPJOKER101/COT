Three opposition candidates in Chad&rsquo;s presidential elections said Tuesday that they would boycott the vote over concerns that the results would not be credible. The elections were initially scheduled for April 3, and the government of President Idriss D&eacute;by had agreed last week to postpone them until April 24 after six opposition candidates threatened a boycott over the voter registration process. Three of those candidates said their demands had not been met, and they called on their supporters not to vote.
