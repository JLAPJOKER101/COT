About 70 gunmen suspected of being Islamic militants attacked two police stations and a bank in the northeastern city of Maiduguri on Friday, killing six people, the police said. The attackers were armed with explosives and automatic rifles, which they used to attack multiple targets in the Damboa district, said Mohammed Abubakar, the police commissioner in charge of the region. Four police officers and two civilians were killed in the attack, he said. The authorities in Nigeria&rsquo;s north have blamed Boko Haram, a radical Islamic sect that draws inspiration from Afghanistan&rsquo;s Taliban movement, for a spate of bomb attacks and killings aimed at government officials and the security forces since last year.
