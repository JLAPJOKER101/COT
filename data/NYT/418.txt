Some of the technology in China&rsquo;s new stealth fighter jet may have come from the wreckage of an American stealth fighter shot down over Serbia in 1999, Balkan military officials said. A Serbian missile shot down an American F-117 Nighthawk, an early radar-evading stealth fighter, during NATO&rsquo;s bombing of Serbia in the Kosovo war. Civilians collected the pieces, which were strewn over a wide area of farmland. Croatia&rsquo;s military chief at the time, Adm. Davor Domazet-Loso, said Croatian intelligence reported &ldquo;Chinese agents crisscrossing the region&rdquo; buying up plane parts from farmers. A senior Serbian military official confirmed that pieces of the wreckage were removed by souvenir collectors, and that some ended up &ldquo;in the hands of foreign military attach&eacute;s.&rdquo; China unveiled its stealth fighter this month.
