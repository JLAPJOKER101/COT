The government has ordered United Nations radio off the air but the station refused to comply. A regulatory board loyal to the incumbent leader Laurent Gbagbo issued a decree on Wednesday revoking the station&rsquo;s broadcast permit. However, the station&rsquo;s director, Sylvain Semilinko, said Thursday that  preparations were being made in case its signal was jammed. Mr. Gbagbo has refused to leave office since he lost an election in November, which the United Nations supervised and certified.
