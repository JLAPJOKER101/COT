Were about fifteen minutes away from the start of Disrupt Hackathon Beijing and it looks like we have about 350 people on the floor and teams are forming now. It will be interesting to see what folks come up with at this our first Disrupt in China  let alone our first Disrupt event outside of the US.Our intrepid photographer Duncan Leung of GreatWallClub and the TCTV crew will be shooting stills and video from the event and we should be able to get out some live streams as the event progresses.
