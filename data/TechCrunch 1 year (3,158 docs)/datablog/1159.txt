Here we go! After a bit of back and forth, Ive decided to run the TCVA mini-meetups in DC-Norfolk-Richmond order. We have some sponsors on tap and hopefully we can have a good time and get the word out about the VA tech corridor. Virginia, after all, is for entrepreneurs (and lovers).This isnt a boring panel discussion or wonkathon  this is a networking event and I want you guys to let me know what youre working on. Ill be available to chat along with TC writer Jordan Crook for the entire evening so have your iPads loaded with a pitch deck and a small card containing your website and pertinent info. Dont bring a packet of papers. Ill just lose it.Special thanks to folks in Richmond and Norfolk for donating their office spaces for our nefarious ends. Follow me @johnbiggs and Jordan @jordanrcrook for updates during the evening.So heres how its going down:Monday, April 9  DC  RFD  810 7th St NW  6pm-10pm (??)  Our first event will be at RFD in NW. These guys have a huge selection of beers on tap and, if we play our cards right, well have a few hours of open bar. If you havent RSVPed hop over to Plancast or email me at john@techcrunch.com with the subject RSVP DC. Try to include a rough headcount.Our first sponsors are HomeSnap by Sawbuck, Canvas.co and Create Digital.
