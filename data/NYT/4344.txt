Ivory Coast&rsquo;s government will demobilize 10,000 gunmen by the end of the year, the state news media reported Wednesday, as it tries to re-establish security after a decade of conflict and division. Reviving the economy depends largely on the government&rsquo;s ability to forge a disciplined and unified force from former government and rebel units, as well as a plethora of gunmen who took part in fighting that eventually ended a postelection standoff and brought Alassane Ouattara to power earlier this year.
