Chris Dixon wraps up his interview with FindTheBest (and DoubleClick) co-founder, Kevin OConnor by asking him about his end goal for FindTheBest. OConnor responds that an exit strategy is total bullshit, he is simply doing what he loves doing and notes that if you solve a big problem you end up with lots of options.OConnor also suggests that people are actually using the social web less intensely as its novelty fades and it becomes a regular part of their web experience.As the interview concludes in the video below, Dixon inquires about OConnors distribution channel for his decision-making engine, FindTheBest. They discuss how all the attempts to game Google makes it harder to be discovered. OConnor tells Dixon most of his early efforts are directed towards SEO. Recognizing SEOs flaws (with people trying to manipulate the system) OConnor notes Googles attempts to clean up SEO with Panda and says that Panda improved FindTheBests results by 25% the day after Panda launched.At about 4:25 into the video Dixon notes that the market FindtheBest is in has become flooded with B2C web sites. Dixon asks OConnor if he worries that there is so much noise out there that it makes it harder for you to compete?OConnor responds, our competitors are 10,000 niche sites, we literally do everything from summer camps to fractional aircraft programs to mercury levels in fish. He goes on to say that their competitive advantage lies in the breadth of categories they compare and the big winner in the space will be whoever can amortize their R&D expense across the biggest base. He ends by saying, for us to enter any one of these individual markets actually turns out to be very inexpensive.Make sure to watch episodes I, II and III of Dixons interview with Kevin OConnor.
