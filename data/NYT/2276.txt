The number of bodies found in mass graves in northeastern Mexico has risen to 183, officials said Tuesday as investigators continued searching a rural region of Tamaulipas State about 90 miles south of the Texas border. The authorities have detained 74 people, including 17 police officers from the municipality of San Fernando, on suspicion of involvement in the killings, Mexico&rsquo;s attorney general, Marisela Morales, said. Many of the victims were believed to be migrants traveling to the United States on long-distance buses who were kidnapped by the Zetas drug cartel. Officials searching through another mass grave in the north-central state of Durango said Tuesday that the toll there had risen to 75.
