The detained leader of the most prominent human rights group in Belarus faces up to seven years in jail for helping political prisoners and government critics, the group said Friday. The police detained the leader, Ales Belyatsky of the Vesna group, outside his home in the capital, Minsk, on Thursday, and searched his apartment, country house and the group&rsquo;s offices. Mr. Belyatsky faces charges of &ldquo;concealment of income,&rdquo; the group said in a statement. It said Mr. Belyatsky received large amounts of cash in neighboring Lithuania from Western donors because the group was barred from receiving grants in Belarus.
