TechCrunch Disrupt winner Shaker is already getting ready for New Years Eve. The Facebook app creates 3D virtual rooms where you can party with your friends and meet new people. The startup is partnering with Dick Clark Productions to create a virtual loft where a pre-party will take place right before the Dick Clarks New Years Rockin Eve with Ryan Seacrest 2012 show begins.The New Years Eve loft will be a place where people can virtually hang out between 4PM and 8PM ET on New Years Eve before the live show begins. You will be able to dance, mingle, buy virtual drinks and watch exclusive interviews with some of the performers who will be on the ABC television show, including Will.i.am, Taio Cruz, LMFAO, Gym Class Heroes, Fergie, Blink 182, and The Band Perry. (RSVP for the event here, or just show up on New Years Eveâ€”there are no fire codes for virtual lofts so there is no limit to how many people can be packed inside).Hanging out in virtual spaces to meet new people is still a fairly new concept. Big partnerships like this one will expose Shaker to a mainstream audience. But the experience will have to be compelling enough for them to come back on their own. Ultimately, that will depend on who shows up for the party.
