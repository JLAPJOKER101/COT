GoGoFantasy is a patent-pending system for crowdfunding porn. Folks with fetishes, grandmas with groin urgings, and couples into copulating can create projects and request cash in return for filming certain acts. For example, one young lady will mount two cameras in a small plane and film her activity in the cabin. And she wont be reading her Kindle and eating peanuts, if you catch my meaning.Sadly, the fantasies are as tortuously contrived as a shower scene in a Cinemax late night movie but FSM bless these folks for trying. For example, one couple wants to join the mile high club together and another wants to film themselves hitchhiking under the big top. Either one of these projects could be done quickly and easily with an iPhone and a can of lube, but somehow the crowdfunding aspect makes things a bit more transgressive.So far theyve raised $26,000 from over 600 active users from 17 countries. Considering the Pebble watch just made $3 million, these are still small potatoes. Like the famed Diane Peerless Productions, a male order fantasy outfit in LA once run by a pair of charming brothers, GoGoFantasy is aiming at a certain class of porn connoisseur looking for custom content.They are also up against Offbeatr, a similar ideal. However, the creators of GoGoFantasy have patented their idea so expect to see some delightful lawsuits in the future.
