The companys software helps businesses create everything from email campaigns to other online and social channels, and then tracks the effectiveness of each one from a dashboard. And Marketo will measure the impact of each campaign and program in real-time including email volumes and leads generated, so users can see which campaign is successful and tweak accordingly.The software also scores leads to show sales teams where the best opportunities are, and helps sales reps nurture leads.
