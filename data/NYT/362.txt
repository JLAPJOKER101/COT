The Vatican is watching the sex scandal engulfing the Italian prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi, &ldquo;with concern,&rdquo; its secretary of state, Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, said Thursday, the news agency ANSA reported. The cardinal&rsquo;s remarks are a sign of Mr. Berlusconi&rsquo;s growing political weakness a week after prosecutors began investigating whether he compensated &ldquo;a significant number&rdquo; of women, including a minor, for sex. The prime minister denies all wrongdoing. According to ANSA, Cardinal Bertone said the Roman Catholic Church urged greater &ldquo;morality&rdquo; and &ldquo;legality&rdquo; in public life, especially from those holding public office. His remarks were seen as lending support to centrist politicians who seek to oust Mr. Berlusconi. In a television interview on Wednesday, the minor, Karima el-Mahroug, denied that she had sex with Mr. Berlusconi or asked for money in exchange for her silence, as wiretapped phone conversations published in the Italian news media this week suggested.
