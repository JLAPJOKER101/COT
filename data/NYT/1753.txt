DAKAR, Senegal &mdash; The rule of Ivory Coast&rsquo;s strongman, Laurent Gbagbo, took another blow on Wednesday as the country&rsquo;s administrative capital fell to forces loyal to his rival, Alassane Ouattara, with little resistance.        

The battle for the country&rsquo;s presidency appeared to be entering a decisive phase. By late afternoon, Mr. Ouattara&rsquo;s troops were patrolling the streets of the capital, Yamoussoukro, to welcoming greetings and celebratory gunfire from citizens, two residents there said. Meanwhile, Mr. Ouattara&rsquo;s prime minister, Guillaume Soro, delivered an ultimatum to Mr. Gbagbo on French radio and television, saying he had only &ldquo;several hours&rdquo; to give up power.        

Spokesmen for Mr. Ouattara, the man recognized internationally as the winner of elections last November, said the taking of Yamoussokrou had been accomplished with hardly a shot fired &mdash; another easy victory in a week when Mr. Gbagbo&rsquo;s forces appeared to be crumbling from east to west in the West African nation.        

&ldquo;It was like butter,&rdquo; said the spokesman for Mr. Ouattara&rsquo;s military, Capt. L&eacute;on Alla, who added that there had been gunfire exchanges in a town just to the north, shortly before the descent of the Ouattara forces into the capital.        

The capture of Yamoussoukro on Wednesday was mostly a symbolic victory for Mr. Gbagbo&rsquo;s opponents, as the country&rsquo;s government and economy operate from the commercial capital, Abidjan. Still, Yamoussoukro, with a population of some 200,000, has resonance for Ivorians. It was both the birthplace and the brainchild of the country&rsquo;s founder, F&eacute;lix Houphou&euml;t-Boigny, who led Ivory Coast to independence in 1960.        

Mr. Houphou&euml;t-Boigny built a giant basilica there, and Mr. Gbagbo has continued his policy of designing grandiose projects for what had been a simple village until recent times. Capturing the city showed a clear rebel advance on Mr. Gbagbo&rsquo;s terrain. &ldquo;If they can do this today, it&rsquo;s really tough for Gbagbo,&rdquo; said Rinaldo Depagne, an Ivory Coast specialist with International Crisis Group&rsquo;s West Africa office. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the second city, the city of the founding father.&rdquo;        

The taking of Yamoussoukro put the opposition forces within 143 miles of Abidjan, the crucial stake in what has now become an open war for the presidency of what was once Francophone Africa&rsquo;s economic leader.        

There was further evidence of deteriorating conditions in the country on Wednesday. Residents reported gunfire exchanges, and the French government said its ambassador&rsquo;s motorcade had been fired on by Mr. Gbagbo&rsquo;s forces, &ldquo;suggesting once more that Laurent Gbagbo no longer respects anything, that he is pursuing his policy of blind violence, and that he doesn&rsquo;t hesitate to threaten human life, Ivorian and foreign alike,&rdquo; a statement from the French foreign ministry said.        

The next stage is likely to be the toughest of a four-month fight by Mr. Ouattara to accede to office after the elections last November. While a series of strategic towns in the cocoa belt have fallen with surprising ease this week to Mr. Ouattara&rsquo;s forces &mdash; with several reports of Gbagbo forces giving up, surrendering or simply shedding their uniforms &mdash; the taking of Abidjan is likely to be much more difficult.        

A sprawling metropolis of some four million in normal times &mdash; though as many as a million have already fled, according to the United Nations &mdash; the core of Mr. Gbagbo&rsquo;s resistance is concentrated there. Some analysts are predicting that he will not give it up without a bloody fight.        

&ldquo;I think there will be a battle for Abidjan,&rdquo; Mr. Depagne said.        

Mr. Ouattara&rsquo;s camp on Wednesday sought to minimize such talk, however, in an apparent bid to accelerate the military defections that have already occurred.        

&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think there will be a fight,&rdquo; Captain Alla said. &ldquo;The barracks are deserted. We&rsquo;re asking our brothers-in-arms not to expose their lives.&rdquo; But he added a warning: &ldquo;For those who think their lives depend on defending Mr. Gbagbo, they will realize the consequences.&rdquo;        

In Yamoussoukro there was hardly a fight, Captain Alla and others said, with most of the Gbagbo forces quickly surrendering.        

&ldquo;The Republican forces took it without a fight,&rdquo; said Ousmane Diallo, a local journalist, speaking from Yamoussoukro on Wednesday afternoon. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve just seen the soldiers, and they are patrolling the city, to the applause of the population,&rdquo; Mr. Diallo said. &ldquo;There were no deaths at Yamoussoukro,&rdquo; he added.        

He said the Ouattara forces had offered to immediately enlist Mr. Gbagbo&rsquo;s soldiers &mdash; an offer many of them accepted, he said.        

&ldquo;The Republican Forces have been received with joy,&rdquo; said Ahmed Timit&eacute;, another resident reached by phone. Mr. Gbagbo&rsquo;s forces, he said, &ldquo;simply fled. They took off. There was no contest.&rdquo;
