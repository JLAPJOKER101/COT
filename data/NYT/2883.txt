A Puerto Rican tourist who was attacked by muggers in Naples died Friday, nine days after being hospitalized with head injuries, doctors said. The police said that the victim, &Oacute;scar Antonio Mendoza, 66, had been strolling with his wife on May 18, shortly after they arrived aboard a cruise ship, when he was assaulted by two muggers on a scooter after he resisted their efforts to steal his Rolex watch. Dr. Maurizo Postiglione, head of intensive care at Loreto Mare hospital, said that Mr. Mendoza never regained consciousness, despite having undergone brain surgery for multiple cerebral contusions.
