Our own Greg Kumparak walked through the Hackathon Hall this evening, talking to all and sundry about their projects. Some notable hacks included an app for the ladies. How does it work? In Asia, guys buy girls gifts before they ask them out. With this app, the ladies can take a picture of an item and then broadcast her desire for it to the men nearby. The fellow who is quickest to his wallet will, it is assumed, receive a date. For those still working on projects, may I suggest a related app that would involve a system for giving me beer and Peking duck on demand, no dates promised or expected?Take a look at our long walk through TCDBJ and watch tomorrow as the finalists compete for wonderful prizes including cash, iPads 2, and more cash.
