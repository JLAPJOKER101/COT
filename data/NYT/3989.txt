The Ministry of Public Security said Wednesday that the police had rescued 81 children from a child trafficking ring in eastern China. Xinhua, China&rsquo;s official news agency, reported that 13 babies were rescued in Hebei Province ranging in age from 10 days to 4 months; most were girls. Liu Ancheng, a ministry deputy director, blamed the practice of &ldquo;buying and selling children in this country&rdquo; on the traditional preference for boy babies.
