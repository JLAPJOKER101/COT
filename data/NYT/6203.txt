King Mohammed VI of Morocco appointed as prime minister on Tuesday the head of the moderate Islamist party that on Friday won the country&rsquo;s first elections under a new constitution, the royal palace said. The king chose Abdellilah Benkirane, the general secretary of the Justice and Development Party, to form a coalition government. The new Constitution, drafted by the king in response to calls for more democracy inspired by the Arab Spring, still reserves important powers for the king, including over military and religious matters.
