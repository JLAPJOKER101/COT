An American woman living in Scotland admitted on Monday to having stabbed her three children to death amid a custody battle with their father. Theresa Riggi, 47, pleaded guilty in an Edinburgh court to culpable homicide on the grounds of diminished responsibility. Her lawyer said she had narcissistic, paranoid and hysterical personality disorders and acute stress.        

She had originally been charged with murder in the deaths of her 8-year-old twins, Austin and Luke, and their 5-year-old sister, Cecilia. Sentencing is expected in April.
