Hey, what do you know! Its been just shy of two weeks since Apples last Beta release of iOS 5, and just like clockwork, theyre back with another serving.You guys all know the drill at this point: as usual, this Beta release is for developers (and developers) only — but on the upside, that Beta version number probably wont climb too much higher before this thing gets released to everyone.Plus: at this point, the releases seem to be boiling down to bug fixes and tiny tweaks. If youve managed to hold out this long, youre probably not going to miss too much that you wouldnt have seen in the first 6.Alas, Apple doesnt really release a change log pointing to all the fun little gems (other sites may post what they call Apples change log, but these are just Apples developer-oriented API notes/tweaks. These notes are almost identical from Beta to Beta, and have little to do with user-facing changes.) With that said, well keep an eye out for big, notable changes and update this post as we come across them — be sure to let us know down in the comments if you spot any!Like the past two releases, Beta 7 can be downloaded as a slim update over-the-air, or as a full image through the Apple developer portal.
