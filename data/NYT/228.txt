The government has raised the death toll for the January 2010 earthquake to 316,000, a substantial increase from the more than 250,000 deaths previously reported. Officials did not explain the change and did not respond to inquiries about it on Thursday. But Prime Minister Jean-Max Bellerive, at a news conference on Wednesday marking the first anniversary of the disaster, suggested it had increased at least in part because additional bodies had been pulled from the rubble.
