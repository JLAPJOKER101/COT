Some 30,000 Bahrainis shouting &ldquo;one man, one vote&rdquo; attended an opposition rally on Friday to demand political reforms from the Sunni monarchy. The rally was organized by the largest Shiite opposition party, Wefaq, which is engaged in talks with the government. The party&rsquo;s leader, Sheik Ali Salman, said the group would decide Sunday whether to withdraw from the talks.
