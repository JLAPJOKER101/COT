Israeli aircraft killed three Palestinian militants early Saturday who were planning to abduct Israelis over the coming Jewish holiday of Passover, the military said. An Israeli military spokeswoman said an aircraft had fired on a Hamas &ldquo;terror squad&rdquo; that was planning to carry out kidnappings in Israel and in a resort in Egypt. Witnesses said a missile fired from an aircraft hit a car near Gaza City just before 2 a.m. The Islamic militant group Hamas, which controls Gaza, issued a statement saying the men killed were Hamas militants. They called the strike &ldquo;a crime&rdquo; and vowed revenge.
