In 2012, Facebook will be making 45 privacy-related changes to comply with the recommendations of an audit by Irelands Office of the Data Protection Commissioner (DPC) released today. Below Ive compiled a roadmap of all the changes Facebook will implement based on the the 149 pages of DPC recommendations and how the social network says it will address them.First, read my analysis of the audits findings from this morning. It explains why these changes wont seriously interfere with Facebooks business model or product development. Thats very good news for Facebook. Still, complying with the audits recommendations could prevent the company from building a huge stockpile of historical data for some unknown later use.The changes mostly deal with how long Facebook retains data, and how people are educated about Facebooks usage of that data. Some will require engineering work, such as irrevocably deleting user data within 40 days of an account deletion request. Others will simply see Facebook adding additional links or messaging within the product to improve transparency and user understanding.Facebook avoided having to make some big changes that could have hurt its business, such as needing users to explicitly opt in to ad targeting based on their personal data. It also wont have to discontinue its facial recognition feature, or requires users to opt into having their content used in Sponsored Stories ads.Here are the 45 changes Facebook will implement and their due dates:Privacy and Data Use PolicyAdvertising Use of User DataAccess RequestsRetention of DataThird-Party Apps
