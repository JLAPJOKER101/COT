A French skyscraper climber successfully scaled the world&rsquo;s tallest building on Monday, even navigating the tapered spire that extends beyond the top floors of the structure in Dubai. It took more than six hours for Alain Robert, 48, left, to climb the 2,717-foot-tall Burj Khalifa. Unlike in his previous climbs, Mr. Robert, who calls himself Spiderman, used a rope and harness to comply with organizers&rsquo; requirements. He has climbed more than 70 skyscrapers.
