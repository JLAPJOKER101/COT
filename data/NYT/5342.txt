Parliament voted in an emergency session on Tuesday to halt development of Uganda&rsquo;s nascent oil sector. The session was called on Monday to debate the potentially lucrative industry, in which foreign contracts have been kept secret and allegations of corruption are rampant. The session continued on Tuesday with members of Parliament accusing officials close to President Yoweri Museveni of accepting millions of dollars in bribes. Lawmakers also called for a delay in the imminent signing of an agreement between the government and three oil companies, and suspended new ventures until a national oil policy could be put in place. The vote comes at a time when commodity prices have skyrocketed and dissent is spreading. Large reserves were discovered in 2006 that could turn Uganda into a major oil industry player in Africa.
