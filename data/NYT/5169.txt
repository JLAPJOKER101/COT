COPENHAGEN (Reuters) &mdash; Helle Thorning-Schmidt said on Sunday that she had agreed with political allies to form a three-party center-left coalition government, after a decade of center-right rule in Denmark.        

Ms. Thorning-Schmidt, the leader of the Social Democratic Party, will be the first woman to serve as Denmark&rsquo;s prime minister. She said on Danish television that she had completed a policy program &ldquo;that will bring Denmark out on the other side&rdquo; of its economic crisis. &ldquo;With this program, we can modernize Denmark,&rdquo; she said before paying a brief visit to Queen Margrethe, who gave her formal approval.        

The coalition includes the Social Democrats, Socialist People&rsquo;s Party and Social Liberals.
