Lebanon on Wednesday introduced a draft resolution in the Security Council condemning Israeli settlement expansion on West Bank territory occupied since 1967. No vote is expected soon because the United States criticized the resolution, arguing that the Council should not be the forum for addressing knotty Arab-Israeli issues. A veto would be awkward because the language used in the resolution, which attracted some 120 co-sponsors, echoes previous statements that Washington has endorsed condemning settlements, diplomats said.
