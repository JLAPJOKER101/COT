CAIRO &mdash; As part of the general mood here to expunge everything reminiscent of former President Hosni Mubarak, an Egyptian court on Thursday ordered the removal of his name and likeness from all public institutions.        

The order comes a week after Mr. Mubarak was remanded for interrogation, along with his two sons, to answer accusations of financial corruption and ordering the killing of protesters.        

Samir Sabry, the Egyptian lawyer who filed the lawsuit, argued that the presence of Mr. Mubarak&rsquo;s name on buildings and streets at a time when the former president and his family were widely seen as symbols of corruption and tyranny was a provocation to national sentiment.        

&ldquo;Why should his name continue to be there?&rdquo; Mr. Sabry said. &ldquo;You put people&rsquo;s names up to honor them. Now what are we honoring him for?&rdquo;        

The court seemed to agree. Now, the names, photographs and pictures of Mr. Mubarak and his wife, Suzanne, will be removed &ldquo;from all squares, streets, schools, associations, libraries and all entities in Egypt.&rdquo; In his ruling, Judge Muhammad Hassan Omar reasoned that their presence resulted in &ldquo;tremendous harm and continuous suffering&rdquo; to the families of those who died in the three weeks of protests that led to Mr. Mubarak&rsquo;s resignation.        

Mr. Mubarak, 82, has been hospitalized since he learned of the order to arrest him. He has yet to be charged with a crime.        

The ubiquity of Mr. Mubarak&rsquo;s picture, which hung in every government building, attests to the sycophantic behavior that became well ingrained throughout his three decades in power.        

That may explain why one of the first iconic images from the uprising that toppled his government was of a protester climbing a billboard that carried Mr. Mubarak&rsquo;s portrait, punching through the picture and tearing it down.
