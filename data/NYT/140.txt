JUBA, Sudan &mdash; Sudanese and American officials said that Sudan appeared well prepared for a historic vote on Sunday on southern Sudan&rsquo;s independence.        

J. Scott Gration, President Obama&rsquo;s special envoy to Sudan, complimented the country&rsquo;s preparations for an &ldquo;on-time, peaceful and transparent referendum.&rdquo;        

A few months ago, United States officials voiced concern that Sudan could revert to civil war if the referendum was mishandled.        

But on Saturday, Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, who is visiting Sudan to monitor the election, said those risks had been very significantly reduced.        

News agency  reports said that at least six people were killed Friday and Saturday in fighting between southern Sudan&rsquo;s army and a rebel militia.
