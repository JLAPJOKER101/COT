An appeals court has rejected a prosecutor&rsquo;s effort to revoke the parole of  the American activist Lori Berenson, who was released in May after serving 15 years for aiding leftist rebels. Ms. Berenson and her attorney said the ruling was final and cannot be appealed by prosecutors. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m pleased with the decision and grateful for it,&rdquo; she said Monday. Under her parole, the 41-year-old New Yorker cannot leave Peru until her 20-year sentence ends in 2015, unless the president decides to commute it.
