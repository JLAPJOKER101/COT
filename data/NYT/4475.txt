The president of Nepal ordered Parliament on Wednesday to vote for a new prime minister after the main political parties failed to agree on a coalition government. President Ram Baran Yadav had set a Sunday deadline for the parties to form a coalition government with representatives from each group. He extended that deadline by three days, but they were unable to reach a consensus. Former Prime Minister Jhalnath Khanal resigned 10 days ago after failing to make progress in drafting a new constitution, which was supposed to be finished in 2010. Political turmoil has continued in Nepal despite the end of a communist insurgency in 2006, when the Maoists gave up their armed revolt and joined mainstream politics. Nepal is struggling to decide the future of the thousands of former fighters.
