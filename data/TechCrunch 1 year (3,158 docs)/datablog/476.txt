Founded by former Yahoo and Google employees Daniel Raffel and Steve Krulewitz, iOS app Snapguide is announcing a $5 million Series A raise this morning, from investors Atlas Venture, Index Ventures and Michael Arringtons* CrunchFund. This financing comes after a sizeable $2 million seed (more like a pit) round.Snapguides simple UI makes it easy for users to build How-To guides via iPhone. Co-founder Raffel tells me that already the company has had 10K guides like How to Make a Sock Bun created since its launch this March, with millions of unique views spread among them.In the same space as Instructables or WikiHow, but more mobile-focused, the company is currently working on partnerships with major brands. Weve also heard independently that the company received several acquisition offers, but decided to raise capital and expand instead.Were excited to double down on Snapguide and will be using this money to grow our engineering, design and editorial teams, Raffel tells me, on how the company will be using the new money, We are weeks away from a major website overhaul and are also currently working on a big mobile app update.When asked if that app update included Android, Raffel told me that the company is currently focused on iOS. Sign of the times?*Disclosure: In case youve spent the past six years under a rock, Arrington is also the founder of this blog.
