PARIS &mdash; France&rsquo;s first lady, Carla Bruni-Sarkozy, is expecting a child, according to her father-in-law, who spoke to a German tabloid on Tuesday. French tabloids have been speculating about a possible presidential pregnancy for weeks.        

&ldquo;I&rsquo;m looking forward to having a grandchild,&rdquo; said Pal Sarkozy, 83, a former publicist-turned-painter and the father of President Nicolas Sarkozy, in an interview with the tabloid Bild.        

&ldquo;Though Nicolas and his wife do not wish to know their future child&rsquo;s gender,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I am sure that it will be a girl and that she&rsquo;ll be as beautiful as Carla.&rdquo;        

The president&rsquo;s office declined to confirm the report.        

Ms. Bruni-Sarkozy, 43, a model-turned-singer who married Mr. Sarkozy in 2008, spurred speculation about a pregnancy last week when she told a radio station that she would not attend the Cannes Film Festival &ldquo;for personal and also for professional reasons.&rdquo;        

On Monday, after an interview on a public television station, her host said, &ldquo;I know you hate talking about your private life, but I want to simply congratulate you.&rdquo;        

With an embarrassed smile, Ms. Bruni-Sarkozy replied: &ldquo;I congratulate you, too.&rdquo;        

Analysts say Mr. Sarkozy, 56, the most unpopular French leader in decades, could benefit from his wife&rsquo;s pregnancy. Christian Delporte, a French historian, told the news magazine Le Point that it would give Mr. Sarkozy a more protective image, and would help him to be re-elected in 2012.        

Ms. Bruni-Sarkozy already has a son, Aur&eacute;lien, 9, from a previous relationship. Her husband has three sons from his first two marriages.        

If Ms. Bruni-Sarkozy&rsquo;s pregnancy is confirmed, it would be the first time a French first lady gave birth when her husband was in office.
