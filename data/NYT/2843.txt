In a case that has galvanized a protest movement against the government&rsquo;s conduct of the campaign against drug traffickers, the authorities said that they had arrested a man believed to have ordered the murder of seven people. Among the victims was Juan Francisco Sicilia, 24, the son of the poet and journalist Javier Sicilia, left, who has since led marches demanding a change in the government&rsquo;s strategy. The suspect, Julio de Jes&uacute;s Radilla, who was arrested Tuesday, is the leader of the South Pacific cartel in the central state of Morelos, said Luis C&aacute;rdenas Palomino, chief of regional security for the federal police. Mr. Radilla is accused of ordering the killings after two of the younger Mr. Sicilia&rsquo;s friends got into an argument with members of the cartel. Juan Francisco Sicilia was found bound and fatally shot along with six friends in the city of Cuernavaca in March.
