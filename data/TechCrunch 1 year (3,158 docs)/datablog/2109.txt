Move over, Tina Fey  Amazon has just released the list of their ten best-selling books of the year, and Walter Isaacsons thoughtful biography of Steve Jobs has come out on top.The biographys appearance at the top of the list is a bit of a surprise considering its relatively late publication this year, but the books impressive sales performance was fueled by the huge show of fan support after the Apple co-founders untimely passing in October.Amazon culled these rankings from both their traditional book sales figures and Kindle eBook downloads, and this year two titles submitted through Amazons Direct Publishing program have made the top 10: Darcie Chans The Mill River Recluse, and Chris Culvers The Abbey.While Isaacsons take on the life of Jobs took Amazons top honors, it doesnt seem to have fared as well over at Barnes and Noble. According to their list of the years best-sellers (which to be fair only runs through November 21), Jobss biography rounds out the top five. Its performance as a eBook in Nooks line-up is even less impressive: it lands at #33 on the nookbook bestseller list, behind the compiled Hunger Games trilogy and something called Mail-Order Christmas Brides.Heres the full list of Amazons best-sellers, in case youre looking to finish up your holiday shopping with a few good books.
