What is it?
If youre planning on taking a semester off and fly to Europe just to clear your head and get over her (or him), youre going to need a backpack. Thats why Chrome made the Yalta, a backpack that looks like a cross between an Weimar-Era bondage truss and something the Good Soldier Å vejk would carry through the trenches of World War I.This is not to say that the Yalta is only for those who browse army surplus shops. This duffel style backpack has a large top opening and a rear pocket designed to allow for a laptop (no bigger than the Macbook Air) and/or a tablet. There is also a front pocket. To close it, you simply roll up the lip at the top and connect the chromed metal hook into one of the loops sewn to the back of the backpack. The hook, it should be noted, can double as a bottle opener.
