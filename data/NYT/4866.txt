In an enhanced campaign against petty crime and criminality, the government of President Nicolas Sarkozy has banned begging for the next six months on the famous Avenue des Champs-&Eacute;lys&eacute;es from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m., as well as prayers in the streets outside crowded mosques, according to Interior Minister Claude Gu&eacute;ant. Mr. Gu&eacute;ant has offered Muslims a large, unused barracks for a prayer space. He also announced a renewed crackdown on non-French Roma who overstay their visas, saying that delinquent minors will be deported.
