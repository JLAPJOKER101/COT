The Philippines has rejected an appeal from Saudi Arabia to cut by half a minimum-wage requirement for Filipino maids working in Saudi Arabia and will not be sending new domestic helpers until the dispute is resolved. Labor Secretary Rosalinda Baldoz said Friday that the Saudi government wanted the minimum monthly salary for Filipino maids lowered to $200 from $400. About 1.2 million Filipinos work in Saudi Arabia. Ms. Baldoz said that abuse of overseas workers in Arab countries was rampant and that the government would not compromise on its demand for higher wages.
