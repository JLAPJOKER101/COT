Looks like Nokia executives are increasingly picking up on a specific kind of skill honed by Microsoft execs over the past few years: saying something stupid about their competitors that is undoubtedly coming back to bite them in the ass at some point. Straight from the foot in mouth department: in an exclusive interview with Pocket-lint, Niels Munksgaard, Director of Portfolio, Product Marketing & Sales at Nokia Entertainment says iPhone and Android devices no longer appeal to younger crowds:What we see is that youth are pretty much fed up with iPhones. Everyone has the iPhone, he said. Also, many are not happy with the complexity of Android and the lack of security. So we do increasing see that the youth that wants to be on the cutting edge and try something new are turning to the Windows Phone platform.‚ÄùNow, I like Nokias Lumia 800, which runs Windows Phone Mango, a heck of a lot (more on that later). But why this executive felt the need to scoff the iPhone and Android as a whole, is beyond me.Yes, Windows Phone looks and feels different, but not everyone agrees that its better. The reality is Nokia has everything to prove betting the smartphone farm on Microsoft, and a lot to lose. Throwing around statements that todays youths are fed up with the iPhone because everyone has it  what does that even mean? As the proverb goes: speech is silver, silence is golden.(The awesome facepalm image above = courtesy of Flickr user MithrandirAgain)
