Seven members of the rock band Callejeros were convicted on Wednesday in the deaths of 194 people in a nightclub fire in 2004. An appeals court reversed its verdicts of not guilty in an episode that became a symbol of government failure in Argentina. The band members now face up to 11 years each in prison. The band was in charge of the concert&rsquo;s security; evidence showed that the club was given a permit although it lacked basic measures like fire extinguishers.
