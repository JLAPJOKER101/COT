KABUL, Afghanistan &mdash; Afghan officials said Tuesday that insurgents once again attacked during the Id al-Adha holiday, killing 11 people, most of them civilians.        

The attack on Monday was the second major attack against civilians during the three-day holiday, despite a holiday message from the Taliban leader, Mullah Muhammad Omar, that called on his followers to avoid civilian casualties. Eight people were killed on Sunday by a suicide bomber outside a mosque in Baghlan Province in the north.        

In Monday&rsquo;s attack in Badghis Province, in western Afghanistan, insurgents set off a roadside bomb targeting a police truck filled with officers and their family members, who were visiting relatives during the afternoon, said the provincial governor, Delbar Jan Arman.        

Of the 11 people killed, only two were police officers; among the dead were six children, ranging in age from 2 months to 12 years, and two women, Mr. Arman said. Three people were wounded, two of them police officers and one a child.        

The attack was confirmed in a statement by the Interior Ministry. Mr. Arman blamed the Taliban, which had been active in the area of the attack, Qadis District.        

According to United Nations figures, 75 percent of all civilian casualties in the past year were caused by insurgents, compared with 16 percent attributed to NATO and government forces.        

Mullah Omar&rsquo;s unusually strong statement on Friday condemning civilian casualties caused by the insurgents called on those who did so intentionally to be punished. The attacks during the Id al-Adha holiday raised questions about whether Taliban leaders were able to control their followers in some parts of the country.
