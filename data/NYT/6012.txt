Gunmen killed a chief of the Kaiowa-Guarani Indian tribe in western Brazil on Friday, apparently over a land dispute, according to Funai, the federal indigenous affairs agency. An agency spokesman said more than 40 &ldquo;hooded and heavily armed&rdquo; gunmen raided the village of Tekoha Guaiviry in Mato Grosso do Sul State and shot Chief Nisio Gomes. A Funai spokeswoman said it appeared the gunmen had been hired by ranchers seeking to expel the tribe from land claimed by both sides. Renato Santana, a spokesman for the Indian Missionary Council, backed by the Roman Catholic Church, said Mr. Gomes was &ldquo;summarily executed&rdquo; in front of his son. &ldquo;Everything indicates that ranchers, who want the land to raise cattle and plant sugarcane, hired the gunmen to get rid of Gomes, who was an outspoken defender of Indian rights,&rdquo; he said.
