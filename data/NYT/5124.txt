President Obama and Uzbekistan&rsquo;s president, Islam Karimov, discussed expanding use of the Central Asian country as a route to supply troops in Afghanistan, a United States official said Thursday, amid growing concern about the viability of Pakistan as a transit route. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton also met with her Uzbek counterpart on Thursday, and Congress is considering legislative changes that would allow more military aid to Uzbekistan despite its poor human rights record. Mr. Obama&rsquo;s outreach came as the United States and Pakistan are locked in a diplomatic crisis over accusations linking Pakistan&rsquo;s chief intelligence agency to militant attacks on Americans in Afghanistan. Rising tension between Washington and Islamabad has raised questions about Pakistan&rsquo;s role as a major supply route for American forces fighting in Afghanistan.
