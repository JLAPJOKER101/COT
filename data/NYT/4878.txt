Britain has altered a law to make it more difficult for private citizens and activist groups to seek the arrest of foreign politicians for crimes like torture, genocide and war crimes. The change, which took effect Thursday, means that Israeli officials who had feared traveling to Britain because of threats that they might be arrested will now be able to visit again. Under the old law, people could apply to magistrates to have arrest warrants issued against people suspected of committing crimes against humanity. But now the director of public prosecutions will have to consent before such arrest warrants can be issued. The law has been a bone of contention between Israel and Britain for some time, after former Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni canceled a trip to Britain amid reports that activists would seek to have her arrested in connection with the Gaza offensive in 2008 and 2009.
