VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) &mdash; A Canadian judge upheld the deportation on Thursday of one of China&rsquo;s most wanted fugitives, calling him a &ldquo;common criminal.&rdquo;        

The suspect, Lai Changxing, could be returned to China as early as Saturday, said Helen Park, the government&rsquo;s lawyer.        

Mr. Lai&rsquo;s lawyer, David Matas, had asked Canada&rsquo;s Federal Court to stay his client&rsquo;s deportation, arguing he would not get a fair trial in his native country. Mr. Matas told Justice Michel Shore that Communist officials were using his client to deflect allegations of corruption against themselves.        

&ldquo;He&rsquo;s become the poster boy for the fight against corruption,&rdquo; Mr. Matas told the court via telephone from Berlin.        

Mr. Lai, who is accused of masterminding a huge smuggling operation that robbed the Chinese government of millions of dollars in unpaid taxes, has been fighting his deportation to China for 12 years. He has long maintained that he could be tortured or killed if he were returned to his home country.        

But Justice Shore ruled that &ldquo;Mr. Lai has failed to establish that he will suffer irreparable harm if he were returned to China.&rdquo; The judge said the fact that Mr. Lai had been in negotiations with Chinese officials to return belied his assertions of risk if he returns.        

Chinese officials have assured Canada that Mr. Lai would not be executed or tortured and would get a fair trial with access to a lawyer if he is returned to face charges.
