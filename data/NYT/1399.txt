Gunmen fighting to depose Laurent Gbagbo after he refused to concede an election were advancing across the main city of Abidjan on Monday, bringing their fight closer to the city center. Witnesses in the suburb of Adjame, about two miles from the presidential palace, said gunmen backing his rival, Alassane Ouattara, had taken over parts of the neighborhood and were fighting pro-Gbagbo forces with AK-47s and heavier weapons. Mr. Ouattara won the presidential election in November.
