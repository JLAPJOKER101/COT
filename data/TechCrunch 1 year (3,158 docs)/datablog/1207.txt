As the world of apps continues to get ever-more crowded, another app analytics startup has picked up investment to help app developers figure out what is working, and what is not. Paris, France-based Capptain has raised $1.5 million from Russian VC fund Runa Capital.The investment, says Runa, will be used to help Capptain, a cloud-based platform, expand its geographical footprint in Europe, Russia and the U.S. Past funding in the startup was not disclosed but TechCrunch understands that it was a seed round led by angels and totaling around $500,000.In some respects, given how many app analytic platforms there are now  there is Flurry, Kontagent, Localytics, Bango and so many others  one wonders if there will be some consolidation ahead.Like others, Capptain provides real-time monitoring services to chart how apps are downloaded and used. Also like others, it adds a level of marketing services into the mix as well, with the ability to push promotional campaigns for the apps through the platform, and to pull information in from users  for example from surveys.What is perhaps most notable about Capptain is the range of platforms it covers, from iOS, Android, Html5, Web OS, Blackberry/RIM and WP7 down through to Samsungs Smart TV service, and the subsequent range of devices, from mobile handsets and tablets through to Internet-enabled TVs. The company also says that it is better at visualizing its results and offering them in reports that are can be customized.And even with a number of analytics companies out there, there is a large market to serve: not only are apps growing in number, but they are in value, too: the world-wide mobile apps market is forecast to be worth some $25 billion by 2015 by researchers at MarketsandMarkets. ABI Research is even more bullish: it predicts revenues of $46 billion by 2016.Capptain is developed by UBIKOD, which has been around since 2008 and focuses on software-as-a-service for enterprises. As part of the investment, Dmitry Chikhachev, the managing partner of Runa Capital, will become a board member of the parent company.Although based in Russia, Runa Capital has invested in several companies outside the country focused on cloud services. They include enterprise-focused companies ThinkGrid, BigTime Software and StopTheHacker. In February 2012, Runa launched an accelerator in partnership with virtualization provider Parallels aimed at cloud startups.
