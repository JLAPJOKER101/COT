The shelling of a market in Abidjan on Thursday, which killed at least 25 people and wounded 40, may be a crime against humanity, the United Nations said Friday. The United Nations blamed forces loyal to the incumbent president, Laurent Gbagbo, whose refusal to cede power set off the crisis. &ldquo;Such an act, perpetrated against civilians, could constitute a crime against humanity,&rdquo; the United Nations said in a statement on Friday. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon urged the Security Council to &ldquo;take further measures with regard to the Ivorian individuals who are instigating, orchestrating and committing the violence.&rdquo; Mr. Gbagbo denied his forces were involved in the attack.
