MOSCOW &mdash; Georgia and Russia on Wednesday signed an agreement that clears the path for Russia to join the World Trade Organization, ending nine months of often rocky negotiations between the two countries on monitoring trade flows over the Georgian-Russian border.        

&ldquo;The deal is done,&rdquo; said Sergi Kapanadze, Georgia&rsquo;s deputy foreign minister, after emerging from a signing ceremony in Geneva Wednesday afternoon. The agreement, which is based on a Swiss-brokered compromise, comes a day before the final meeting of a World Trade Organization working group on Russia. The working group must approve Russia&rsquo;s accession documents, and formal accession will occur Dec. 15 at the trade bloc&rsquo;s ministerial meeting. Because accession to the group traditionally requires full consensus, Georgia, as a member, was in a position to block Russia&rsquo;s membership bid.
