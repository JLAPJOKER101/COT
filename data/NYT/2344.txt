Russian security forces said Friday that at least 10 Islamist militants had been killed in a special operation in the volatile and mostly Muslim North Caucasus region. At least two women were killed in the operation, which was spurred by a shootout between security forces and militants in the village of Progress on the border between the regions of Stavropol and Kabardino-Balkaria, Russia&rsquo;s Investigative Committee said. It was the latest raid in a campaign to eliminate Islamist fighters and their bases in the North Caucasus after a deadly terrorist attack at a Moscow airport in January that was linked to militants there.
