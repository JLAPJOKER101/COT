The Irish Republic on Wednesday swore in its new prime minister, Enda Kenny, after an election that wiped out the longtime ruling party, Fianna Fail. Mr. Kenny&rsquo;s center-right Fine Gael party will now govern in a coalition with the center-left Labour Party. Ireland has been traumatized by the collapse of its economy and recently accepted a $93 billion loan from the European Union and the International Monetary Fund. Mr. Kenny pledged to enter into a &ldquo;covenant with the Irish people&rdquo; in which &ldquo;honesty is not just the best policy; it&rsquo;s our only policy.&rdquo;
