Violence escalated across the country on Thursday as the government shelled a volatile neighborhood in the capital, Sana, and security forces fired on antigovernment protesters in Taiz, killing a 21-year-old man. Three civilians were killed early Thursday morning by mortar fire after fighting broke out in northern Sana, according to an employee inside a compound that had come under attack. The clashes brought fears that despite a cease-fire brokered in June, war has ignited again between the government and the Ahmars, tribal leaders who are accused of fomenting protests by Yemen&rsquo;s government.
