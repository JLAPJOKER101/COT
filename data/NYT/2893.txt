The government said it would proceed with plans to force anyone wishing to buy marijuana at cafes to first obtain an official pass &mdash; a move intended to stop tourists from buying the drug. Prime Minister Mark Rutte said he planned to introduce the system later this year in the country&rsquo;s south, an area popular with French and German buyers, before moving on to Amsterdam&rsquo;s tourist cafes. A Justice Ministry spokesman said Friday that the Supreme Court must still rule on whether foreigners can be blocked entirely.
