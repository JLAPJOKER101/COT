Apples next-gen iPhone — and the much-talked about (but yet unseen) iPad mini — are some of the most hotly anticipated gadgets of the year. And according to a report by relatively on-point KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, the new iPhone and iPad mini will launch in September.Thus far, weve heard that the iPhone 5 will have a larger 4.08-inch display maintaining the same width as current models, at 640 pixels. TechCrunch has also confirmed — along with Reuters more recently — that the new iPhone will replace its original 30-pin connector dock with a 19-pin mini port.The iPad mini, on the other hand, is said to be the same thickness as the iPod touch 4G, with a screen measuring 7.85-inches. He expects that iPad mini sales should hit 1.8 million units during the time its available (1-2 weeks) in Q3.Of course, Kuo (and the rest of the world) expects Q4 numbers for both products to be ridiculously high, with iPhone projections at 55 million units and iPad estimates hitting 24 million (including both iPad mini, new iPad, and iPad 2).Heres Kuos official word:Though shipments of iPad mini’s components will start in August, the new iPad line will end production, ready for transition to a modified New iPad line. As such, component shipments will drop in August as iPad mini’s components shipments growth will be offset. On a side note, the modified New iPad shares the same exterior as the original model, but contains modifications to correct its thermal dissipation problem and lower-cost components.The September timeline is just a prediction made by this analyst, but it makes sense considering weve already heard that the iPhone is in production.
