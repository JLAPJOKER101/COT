Partial presidential election results announced Friday suggest that the incumbent, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, could be headed to a runoff next month. With votes counted from 2,242 out of 4,457 polling places, Mrs. Sirleaf had 45 percent of the vote, to 30 percent for the ticket led by Winston Tubman, which also includes the former international soccer star George Weah, according to the National Elections Commission. If these percentages hold up, Mrs. Sirleaf would have less than the majority needed to win outright. In third place with 12 percent and the potential to be kingmaker is the former warlord Prince Johnson.
