An agreement between Yemen&rsquo;s government and its opponents on how to carry out a transfer of power has overcome setbacks caused by the outbreak of violence in the capital last week and is near completion, Yemeni officials said. One of the high-ranking officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the negotiations were continuing, said some details were pending, but he expected a final version to be agreed upon by the two sides in the coming week. President Ali Abdullah Saleh, thus far, has cooperated with the plan, the official said. The agreement, if finalized, would be an important breakthrough in the standoff between the governing party and the opposition. However, the actual transfer of power document, known as the gulf initiative, would still have to be signed by the Yemeni vice president in order for a full transfer of power from Mr. Saleh. Mr. Saleh made a surprise return to Sana on Friday after nearly four months in Saudi Arabia. He had been receiving treatment there for wounds suffered in a June bomb attack on the presidential palace.
