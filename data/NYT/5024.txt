A young woman who was found beheaded and mutilated, apparently by Syrian security agents, is believed to be the first woman to die in Syrian custody since the antigovernment uprising there began in March. Amnesty International said Friday that the woman, Zainab al-Hosni, 18, had been detained by security agents to pressure her brother to turn himself in. Ms. Hosni, from the central city of Homs, was seized by men in plain clothes on July 27, the rights group said. Her brother Mohammed, a protest organizer in Homs, was told by telephone that she would be released only if he stopped his activities, the group said. He was arrested this month. On Sept. 13, his mother was summoned by security forces to pick up his body, which showed bruises, burns and gunshots, the group said.
