Say what you will about YouTubes affinity for cats or their audiences collective inability to write insightful comments, but theres one thing that YouTube really just doesnt get enough credit for: saving the music video. As MTV losts its original love in favor of  Nick Cannon Presents: Whacky Garbage Nonsense and re-runs of Americas Next Quickly Forgotten Reality Show Person, music videos went without a proper home for nearly a decade. Then came YouTube.The only bad part about watching music videos on YouTube? Everything else on YouTube. The soul-crushing comments; the gawdy artist backgrounds; the endless recommendations. Thats where Tubalr comes in. Its YouTubes glorious music video collection, minus all of that darn YouTube.Looking past the fact that Tubalr has a downright ridiculous name (is that supposed to be tubular? Tuba Lore? Two-baller? No idea), its quite great. You punch in an artist name, then pick either only (to play only that artists videos) or similar (to play videos from similar artists.) It queues up a big playlist, and you can go about your business as the tunes play on. Think Pandoras concept, mashed up with Youtubes music video archive.The search algorithm still needs a bit of tuning (a search for Reel Big Fish built a playlist of nineteen music videos and one clip called Jessica the Hippo, which was three minutes of an older gentleman talking to a hippo at a zoo.) but this is definitely something I expect to have running on one of my monitors throughout the day.
