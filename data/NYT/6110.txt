Salvatore Montagna, who once controlled the Bonanno crime family in New York, was murdered near Montreal on Thursday. The Quebec police confirmed that the body of a man was found in a river shortly after witnesses heard gunfire. While the police did not identify the victim, several news organizations reported that it was Mr. Montagna. In 2009, he was deported from the United States to Canada, where he was born before being raised in Sicily. It is widely believed that Mr. Montagna was trying to take control of Montreal&rsquo;s organized crime families.
