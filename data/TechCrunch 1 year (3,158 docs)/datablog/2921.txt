FullContact, a startup that just graduated from business accelerator TechStars, has raised $1.5 million in Series A funding from 500 Startups, Tango / High Country Venture, BulletTime Ventures, SK Ventures, Zelkova Ventures and angel investors.FullContact provides an API that software developers can use inside their services and applications to provide users complete and up-to-date contact information.Basically, FullContact lets developers tap into its database of more than 100 million contact records to turn partial, out-of-date contact records into complete contact records. Information includes phone numbers, email addresses, postal addresses, name, title, company, social profile URLs, an image, birthday, instant messenger handles, and more.Sound a little creepy? It depends on how you look at it.The startup employs a crowdsourcing model to update the contact information, only shares contact information thatâ€™s publicly available on the Web (social networks, other APIs etc.), and allows any software application to leverage their contact database via their API. Currently, over 750 developers use their API.The startup says its technology can, however, not be used with advertising networks, ad exchanges or services that tie cookies to contact data.FullContact was founded by Bart Lorang, Travis Todd, and Dan Lynn in 2010.
