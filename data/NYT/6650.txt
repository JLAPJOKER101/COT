An Amsterdam appeals court on Friday upheld a criminal fine of 1 million euros, about $1.3 million, for Trafigura, one of the world&rsquo;s largest commodity traders, for the Dutch portion of an episode that ended with a shipload of toxic waste being dumped in the open in Ivory Coast. At least 16 people were killed and thousands near the dumping areas were sickened, the Ivory Coast government said. The court found Trafigura guilty of concealing the dangerous nature of the sludge, a mix of oil-products waste and caustic chemicals, when its ship, the Probo Koala, delivered its load to the Netherlands in 2006 for treatment and disposal. After deciding it would be cheaper to dispose of the load elsewhere, Trafigura then illegally exported the waste to the Ivory Coast, the court said. The company, which has denied wrongdoing, has paid Ivory Coast a settlement of close to $200 million. A spokesman for the company called the decision disappointing but did not say if the company would appeal to the country&rsquo;s highest court.
