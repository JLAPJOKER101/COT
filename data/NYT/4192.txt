Lobsang Sangay, a Harvard-trained legal scholar, was sworn in Monday as new head of the Tibetan government-in-exile, taking over from the Dalai Lama. Mr. Sangay, who was born in Darjeeling and has never visited Tibet, is the first secular figure to lead the group. He said he would follow the Dalai Lama&rsquo;s approach of seeking increased autonomy for Tibet within China.
