NEW DELHI &mdash; India&rsquo;s health minister said Tuesday that he had been misquoted at an AIDS prevention meeting day earlier when he appeared to describe homosexuality as a &ldquo;disease&rdquo; brought to the country by foreigners, comments that prompted intense criticism and calls for a retraction.        

The minister, Ghulam Nabi Azad, told a news conference on Tuesday that he had been &ldquo;totally misquoted&rdquo; and that he had been referring to H.I.V. &ldquo;I know as health minister that men having sex with men is not a disease,&rdquo; he said.        

Televised footage of a national meeting on Monday of district and mayoral leaders on H.I.V./AIDS prevention showed him appearing to say that homosexuality was &ldquo;unnatural and not good for India.&rdquo;        

&ldquo;It is a disease which has come from other countries,&rdquo; he said in his speech, which he delivered in English and Hindi.        

&ldquo;Even though it is unnatural, it exists in our country and is now fast spreading, making it tough to detect.&rdquo;        

At his news conference, Mr. Azad said he did not want &ldquo; to get into this discussion&rdquo; about whether homosexuality is &ldquo;natural,&rdquo; and said his concern over sex between men had to do with their suffering from the disease and was &ldquo;not against them.&rdquo;        

But in a country where gay rights were hard-won, and where H.I.V. is spread mainly through heterosexual contacts, the resurgence of focus on gay sex &mdash; at an AIDS prevention forum no less &mdash; infuriated activists. &ldquo;To have such a level of bias and ignorance expressed in that context about something so basic is very dangerous,&rdquo; said Mario D&rsquo;Penha, a historian of the gay rights movement in South Asia.        

Some called for a more direct apology from Mr. Azad.        

Anjali Gopalan, who heads the NAZ Foundation, an Indian rights group that works with H.I.V.-positive people, said he did not believe the minister&rsquo;s comments had been taken out of context.        

&ldquo;He needs to acknowledge that he made a mistake &mdash; he needs to apologize, which he is not going to do,&rdquo; she said.        

Homosexuality was decriminalized in a landmark Delhi High Court ruling two years ago. Prior to that, conviction for &ldquo;carnal intercourse against the order of nature&rdquo; could be punished with up to 10 years in prison.        

Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and the president of the governing Congress party, Sonia Gandhi, also attended the meeting, but had left before Mr. Azad spoke.        

Mr. Azad has been the focus of furor in the past. In 2009, he was widely ridiculed after suggesting bringing electricity to remote areas was crucial to population control because villagers would spend more time watching television than having sex.
