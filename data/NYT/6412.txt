MUMBAI, India (Bloomberg) &mdash; West Bengal&rsquo;s chief minister on Sunday ordered a judge-led investigation into the nation&rsquo;s worst fire in seven years, Friday&rsquo;s inferno at the Advanced Medical Research Institute hospital in which 94 people died.        

&ldquo;Since people have faith in the judicial system and a tragedy of huge dimension has occurred, we have taken this decision,&rdquo; Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee was quoted by the Press Trust of India as saying. &ldquo;We have nothing to hide.&rdquo;        

Six senior hospital officials were charged with culpable homicide in connection with the fire at the 180-bed state-of-the-art hospital in Kolkata, formerly Calcutta,        

Doctors fled the hospital soon after the fire broke out, and witnesses described underequipped firefighters smashing window panes to rescue patients, many of them bed-ridden, from the hermetically sealed building.        

The blaze was fed by diesel fuel and motor oil stored in the hospital&rsquo;s basement, according to West Bengal State&rsquo;s minister of urban development, Firhad Hakim.        

It is likely to raise fresh questions about safety in India&rsquo;s booming, but poorly regulated, private hospital business.        

AMRI Hospitals, which is partly owned by Emami Group of Kolkata, a maker of cosmetics and massage oils, said it was postponing forming its inquiry panel in deference to the state investigation, an AMRI senior vice president, S. Upadhyay, said in a telephone interview on Sunday.
