BEIJING &mdash; Meetings between the chief nuclear envoys of North and South Korea were &ldquo;constructive,&rdquo; negotiators said, even though the talks did not produce any breakthroughs on the longstanding impasse over the North&rsquo;s refusal to give up its nuclear program.        

The talks on Wednesday, held at a private club in Beijing, were the second meeting of the two sides since 2009, when North Korea walked away from six-party disarmament talks that also involved the United States, Russia, Japan and China.        

Although he did not elaborate on what was discussed, Wi Sung-lac, the South Korean envoy, expressed guarded satisfaction. &ldquo;We will continue to make these efforts in the future,&rdquo; he told reporters, according to the Yonhap news agency.        

North Korea wants the six-way talks to resume immediately without preconditions. South Korea, backed by the United States, insists that the North suspend its uranium-enrichment program, halt missile testing and allow international inspectors to return before the talks resume.        

The South has also demanded that the North acknowledge responsibility for the torpedoing of a South Korean warship and the shelling of an island last year, killing a total of 50 people.        

The North angrily abandoned the six-party talks in April 2009 after a United Nations rebuke over its launch of a long-range missile. A month later, it detonated a nuclear device underground, prompting a round of international sanctions that have sapped the North&rsquo;s already anemic economy.        

Although relations between the Koreas have deteriorated since then, experts believe that the North is desperate for food aid and an easing of the sanctions, and thus is eager for talks to resume.        

China, the host of the talks and North Korea&rsquo;s most steadfast ally, said on Wednesday that the North Korean prime minister, Choe Yong-rim, would visit Beijing on Sept. 26.
