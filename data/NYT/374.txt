The incumbent leader Laurent Gbagbo is ordering the military to stop and search United Nations vehicles, the latest escalation of hostilities between the man who refuses to leave office and the global body that declared his rival the election winner. Last week, mobs and security forces allied with Mr. Gbagbo attacked at least six United Nations vehicles, setting some ablaze and wounding two people. Martin Nesirky, a United Nations spokesman, said the stop-and-search order was &ldquo;a serious violation of the Status of Forces Agreement and Security Council Resolution 1962&rdquo; and was &ldquo;therefore unacceptable.&rdquo;
