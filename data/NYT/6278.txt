BEIRUT, Lebanon &mdash; A canister containing what Bahrain officials described as highly explosive material damaged the front of a minibus on Sunday near the British Embassy in the capital, Manama, though there were no injuries or serious damage.        

The blast occurred after midnight, damaging five other cars, the Bahraini Interior Ministry said. Though there was no clear sign that the British Embassy was the target, officials there said they had increased security at other diplomatic missions in the capital.        

The explosion occurred less than a week after a crowd stormed the British Embassy and a residential compound for diplomatic staff in Tehran. No one in Bahrain&rsquo;s government immediately linked between the attacks, but it has long insisted that Iran has sought to intervene in the continuing confrontation between Bahrain&rsquo;s Sunni Muslim monarchy and the Shiite-led opposition.        

The opposition has denied carrying out an Iranian agenda in a country where Saudi Arabia plays a dominant role. A report last month into an uprising this year that the government relentlessly crushed also found no specific links between the two.
