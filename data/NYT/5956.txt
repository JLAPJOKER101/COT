BEIJING &mdash; The celebrated Chinese artist and dissident Ai Weiwei on Tuesday posted the equivalent of $1.3 million with Chinese tax authorities in an effort to contest accusations of tax fraud that he says are politically motivated.        

An outspoken critic of the Chinese government, Mr. Ai was detained without charge earlier this year for nearly three months. After he was released, the authorities said his company Fake Culture Ltd. &mdash; which is registered in the name of his wife, Lu Qing &mdash; owed $2.4 million in back taxes and fines and gave him until Wednesday to pay. By putting up roughly half now as a guarantee, Mr. Ai can request an administrative review of the accusations. If he loses, he would have to pay the balance or could sue the tax offices.        

&ldquo;We now have the right to file for administrative review within two months,&rdquo; said Xia Lin, a lawyer representing Fake Culture, &ldquo;which we will do as soon as possible.&rdquo;        

Tuesday&rsquo;s move guarantees that Mr. Ai&rsquo;s case will continue to percolate over the coming months. Mr. Ai has galvanized thousands of supporters who put up some of the money to pay the fine. He has also begun speaking to the foreign media again, even though he says the authorities warned him not to do so. His case has gone mostly unreported in the local press.
