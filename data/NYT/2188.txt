President Abdoulaye Wade said in an interview with a Parisian newspaper that he had no plans to leave office as long as his health held up, and that his country would not see uprisings like those in North Africa. Mr. Wade, 85, left, has said he will seek a third term in the February 2012 presidential election, despite pressure from opposition leaders who accuse him of bending constitutional rules to run again. The president, who has been in office since 2000, dismissed concerns he would be too old for a third term in the interview with the French business daily La Tribune, arguing that age was less an &ldquo;obsession&rdquo; in Africa than in Europe. &ldquo;My father lived to 105 and my grandmother to 120, so I&rsquo;ve still got time in front of me,&rdquo; he said. Turning to the uprisings sweeping North Africa and the Middle East, Mr. Wade said that he did not expect similar movements to take root in Senegal and that he was unconcerned by protests last month over his re-election plans.
