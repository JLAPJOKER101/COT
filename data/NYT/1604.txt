Under legislation approved by the cabinet on Wednesday, Germans who were sexually abused as children are expected to have as long as 30 years after they turn 21 to bring accusations in court. The previous statute of limitations on civil abuse cases was three years. Criminal cases have a statute of limitations of 3 to 30 years, depending on the charges. Justice Minister Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger praised the legislation as strengthening victims&rsquo; rights. Parliament is expected to pass the legislation this year.
