The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations on Monday warned of &ldquo;a possible major resurgence&rdquo; of the H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza virus in the coming months. The virus had been fading since 2006, but migratory birds now seem to be carrying it to infect poultry in more countries, while a variant of the virus has emerged in Vietnam and China that is not easily stopped by vaccines, the F.A.O. said. The resurgence of the virus poses &ldquo;unpredictable risks to human health,&rdquo; the agency said.
