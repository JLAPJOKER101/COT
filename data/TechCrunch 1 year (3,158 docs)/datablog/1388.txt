Small things in our lives are important to us. Our pets are important. Travel is important. Its the small thing that means everything. Thats what Stephen Ebbett, President of Protect Your Bubble, told me in a phone interview last week. And I agree. The little things are important and worth protecting. Protect Your Bubble is probably a new name to most Americans but the Assurant Direct company launched in the U.K. in 2009 where it now insures 400,000 consumers. Starting today the service is available to US consumers as well. This version of Protect Your Bubble is slightly different cross the Pond. Here in the states the company promises simple but comprehensive plans for gadgets, pets and trips. With plans starting at $2.99 a month Protect Your Bubble will insure most gadgets including smartphones, tablets, game systems and TVs. Coverage even includes a guaranteed 24-hour turnaround for a replacement phone or tablets. The company also plans on launching an Android app that will allow for remote locking, wiping and location.But often a persons so-called bubble extends to pets and travel. The company has plans for these items as well. Protect Your Bubble will provide 90% reimbursement for vet fees at any licensed vet across the country. There are multiple plan options based needs with 10% discount given for covering multiple pets. Unlike most other travel insurance companies, Protect Your Bubble offers a multi-trip plan for frequent travelers. Coverage includes trip cancellation, interruption, medical and loss of baggage as well as rental car coverage. Ebbett indicated to me that the company plans aggressive marketing focusing mainly on large metro areas including TV spots and mobile and digital activity. If you got a bubble, this company wants to protect it.
