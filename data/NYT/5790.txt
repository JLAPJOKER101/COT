The opposition presidential candidate Winston Tubman, left, said Friday that he would not participate in Liberia&rsquo;s runoff election set for Tuesday against President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, but the election commission said the vote would take place anyway. &ldquo;Holding elections when there are outstanding issues and challenges undermines our national peace and endangers our democracy,&rdquo; Mr. Tubman said in a statement to supporters after returning from a two-day trip to Abuja, Nigeria, where he met with President Goodluck Jonathan. He urged supporters to boycott the polls and said he would not recognize the new government.
