A Somali man convicted of terrorism for breaking into the home of a Danish cartoonist was sentenced Friday to nine years in prison. After serving the sentence, he should be expelled from Denmark, the court ruled. The Somali, Muhideen Mohammed Geele, broke into the cartoonist&rsquo;s home armed with an ax last year. The cartoonist, Kurt Westergaard, 75, who was unharmed, had drawn one of 12 cartoons published in a Danish newspaper in 2005 that incited violent protests across the Muslim world. Mr. Geele&rsquo;s lawyer said he would appeal the decision.
