A group of computer hackers on Thursday claimed to have breached NATO security and accessed a trove of restricted material. The group, called Anonymous, said that it would be &ldquo;irresponsible&rdquo; to publish most of the material it took from NATO, but that it was sitting on about one gigabyte of data. &ldquo;Hi NATO,&rdquo; the group teased on Twitter. &ldquo;Yes, we haz more of your delicious data.&rdquo; A NATO official, who could not be named under standing rules, said the organization was aware that a hacker group had released what it claimed to be classified NATO documents on the Internet and was investigating. &ldquo;We strongly condemn any leak of classified documents, which can potentially endanger the security of NATO allies, armed forces and citizens,&rdquo; the official said. Anonymous is a loosely organized group of hackers sympathetic to WikiLeaks. It has claimed responsibility for attacks against corporate and government Web sites worldwide.
