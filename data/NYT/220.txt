Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said Friday in Tokyo that the United States had seen signs of a &ldquo;disconnect&rdquo; between China&rsquo;s civilian and military leadership in episodes over the last several years, including when President Hu Jintao appeared to be unaware this week of the test flight of a new Chinese stealth fighter. Mr. Gates said the gap was &ldquo;a worry,&rdquo; but held out the possibility that some incidents might have been the result of bureaucratic mistakes. Over all, he said he remained confident that Mr. Hu, who is to meet with President Obama in Washington next week, is in control of the military.
