A Chechen poet known for speaking out against separatists in his volatile native region was shot to death outside his home in Moscow late Tuesday night in what investigators said was probably a contract murder. The poet, Ruslan Akhtakhanov, 58, left, was also known to be a supporter of Chechnya&rsquo;s leader, Ramzan A. Kadyrov, who described the victim in a statement posted to the Chechen government Web site as a &ldquo;shining representative of the Chechen intelligentsia.&rdquo; On his own Web site, Mr. Akhtakhanov said he began writing poetry after being kidnapped by &ldquo;bandits,&rdquo; a term usually used to describe separatist fighters in Chechnya.
