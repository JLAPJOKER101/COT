It seems as though nobodys a fan of RIMs BlackBerry PlayBook. Last year, I wouldve agreed wholeheartedly. Whats a tablet good for  ahem, an enterprise-style tablet no less  if you cant natively check email, store contacts, or access a calendar. But even though much of thats going to change with the release of PlayBook 2.0 OS, some peeps still cant get on board. In this instance, it would be Netflix. According to Reuters, Netflix has stated that it has no plans to support the BlackBerry PlayBook or any other BlackBerry device for that matter. Even with the issues Netflix has had in the past year  including awful streaming margins and a price hike backlash  the fact that consumers are putting even more screens in front of their faces should bode well. Still, Netflix doesnt seem to be too enthused with RIM or their offerings. Netflix is already available on the iPad, iPhone, and various Android devices. Since the PlayBook 2.0 OS comes with an Android emulator (which lets people play with Android apps on the PlayBook), we had thought that it would be relatively easy for the Android app to be ported over to the PlayBook. Unfortunately, no such luck.
