In a rare rebuke of the country&rsquo;s powerful military, the police charged six members of a paramilitary force on Friday in the killing of an unarmed man last week, a government lawyer said. A civilian was also charged. The killing in Karachi was caught on videotape and broadcast on television nationwide, fueling anger against the security forces. The seven men were charged with murder and committing an act of terrorism, a police official said.
