Judges at the International Criminal Court in The Hague have given the prosecutor the go-ahead to investigate war crimes in Ivory Coast after the country&rsquo;s disputed presidential elections last year. The prosecutor has said that both sides in the conflict, the forces backing the ousted leader Laurent Gbagbo and those backing his successor, Alassane Ouattara, had killed civilians and committed other crimes, including rape. Less than a week ago, the new government also formed a Truth and Reconciliation Commission to help establish peace, after the killing of an estimated 3,000 people and the destruction of vast numbers of homes.
