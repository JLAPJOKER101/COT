ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast &mdash; Signs of economic collapse, big and small, are obvious: a once booming port is as peaceful as a country road; lines of civil servants hoping for pay snake around downtown banks for days; factories, shops and restaurants are shuttered until further notice; eggs are impossible to find in the supermarket.        

On the surface, tough international sanctions appear to be succeeding against Laurent Gbagbo, the strongman who refuses to concede office after losing an election last year. And yet beneath it, a different reality continues to assert itself.        

Mr. Gbagbo is still in power, more than three months after the vote he lost. He is still coming up with rubber-band fixes for his battered economy, declaring last week that his government would take over the purchase and export of cocoa, the country&rsquo;s signature crop. He is still brutally snuffing out dissent. And he is still, night after night on state television, blaming the United Nations, France and the United States for his country&rsquo;s problems &mdash; to potent effect among the populace.        

It&rsquo;s a school for autocrats under siege: cut back, cut down, lash out. No diplomat, political analyst or average citizen here can predict with confidence how long Mr. Gbagbo will last, even though his revenues are a fraction of what they were. Customs duties at the port are down more than 96 percent, according to some diplomats, and he faces almost total diplomatic isolation. But there is good reason for the reluctance in forecasting his fall.        

&ldquo;It will be a shadow of the economy it was, but it doesn&rsquo;t take a thriving economy to stay in power,&rdquo; said a diplomat, who was not authorized to speak publicly. &ldquo;He can wreck the economy and stay in power. If he makes it through the month of March, I think he could be here 20 years.&rdquo;        

For Mr. Gbagbo to remain in the presidential palace, Ivory Coast, richer in agricultural resources than any West African neighbor, does not need to continue being responsible for 40 percent of the region&rsquo;s gross domestic product.        

The Ivorian ruler is following a textbook survival course for autocrats, with ample precedent on the continent: President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe is still in office years into the destruction of his country&rsquo;s economy, and Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi of Libya is hanging tough in the face of a far more active armed opposition than is currently under way in Ivory Coast.        

One of the last peaceful, sustained expressions of public dissent here &mdash; women protesting with branches symbolizing peace &mdash; has been mown down in volleys of machine-gun fire from Mr. Gbagbo&rsquo;s security forces. Human Rights Watch said Tuesday that such repression against civilians &ldquo;gives every indication of amounting to crimes against humanity.&rdquo;        

The topsy-turvy, up-is-down world portrayed nightly on the state broadcaster, RTI, may not be so far from the realities on the ground. Mr. Gbagbo is always introduced ceremoniously as &ldquo;His Excellency the President of the Republic, Laurent Gbagbo,&rdquo; which he effectively is, even though he has almost no recognition abroad. New &ldquo;laws,&rdquo; with elaborate numerical designations, in the French manner, are solemnly read out by his government, which most Ivorians voted against but which still retains control.        

On the street, the civil servants who were massed around the government-owned banks, waiting to be paid &mdash; foreign banks closed after the regional central bank cut Mr. Gbagbo off, instantly blocking about 93 percent of bank accounts, diplomats and bankers said &mdash; were restive last week, but not rioting.        

&ldquo;They are going to pay everybody,&rdquo; said Yao Kouame, a teacher, waiting in the central Plateau district of Abidjan.        

&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t stopped working,&rdquo; another state worker said. &ldquo;We are not going to die of hunger.&rdquo;        

Others were ready with a stream of invective against President Obama. America is held nearly as responsible as France in the Gbagbo discourse, and the previous night&rsquo;s anti-Western talking points on the state broadcaster come readily to the lips of government workers and Mr. Gbagbo&rsquo;s soldiers alike, a tribute to the effectiveness of the government&rsquo;s propaganda machine.        

Even the United Nations peacekeeping force here, one of the few protections for civilians against Mr. Gbagbo&rsquo;s security services, albeit a limited one, is portrayed as supporting &ldquo;terrorists&rdquo; and, as in a recent broadcast, &ldquo;no longer hiding its determination to destabilize Ivory Coast.&rdquo;        

Diplomats here estimate that Mr. Gbagbo&rsquo;s government was able to pay 50 to 80 percent of the 144,000 civil servants in February, enough to keep some cash in circulation, in what has largely been a cash economy anyway. &ldquo;They found a way to put cash in some people&rsquo;s hands,&rdquo; the diplomat said. &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t seen any protests about government workers&rsquo; not getting paid.&rdquo;        

The bank shutdown has mostly hurt the tiny middle class, and the elite around Mr. Gbagbo. &ldquo;An attack on human rights,&rdquo; Mr. Gbagbo&rsquo;s foreign minister, Alcide Dj&eacute;dj&eacute;, called it last week, adding angrily that it was &ldquo;one of the greatest scandals of the century.&rdquo;

Few Ivorians had bank accounts before the crisis, perhaps no more than 7 percent, so while some commerce has shut down, fruit and vegetable stalls, meat vendors and small shops continue to do business in many parts of this commercial capital.        

&ldquo;The economic operators, they are adapting themselves quite well,&rdquo; a senior local banker said. &ldquo;We have become a cash economy.&rdquo;        

Ivory Coast is the world&rsquo;s leading producer of cocoa, and Mr. Gbagbo&rsquo;s move to take over purchasing and export of the beans allows him to enter a sector accounting for perhaps 20 percent of the country&rsquo;s gross domestic product, diplomats said. Next, in the view of some businessmen in the cocoa sector, could be a government seizure of the huge cocoa bean stock, worth as much as $1.5 billion, sitting in warehouses.        

The government denied that it was contemplating this, but warned of &ldquo;sanctions&rdquo; against private businesses if the beans were not exported by a March 31 deadline. &ldquo;If he sells the cocoa, he&rsquo;ll have the cash,&rdquo; a businessman in the sector warned, speaking anonymously for fear of reprisals. &ldquo;Everything is possible.&rdquo;        

But European Union sanctions prohibit trade with entities tied to Mr. Gbagbo&rsquo;s government, including ports. The internationally recognized winner of last year&rsquo;s election, Alassane Ouattara, has also called for a halt in exports, which the major cocoa companies have largely respected. So groups of unemployed dock hands sit around glumly, waiting.        

&ldquo;Every day we come, and there&rsquo;s nothing,&rdquo; said one, Ouma Diarra. &ldquo;There are no boats coming in. We come in the morning and wait. Now, there&rsquo;s no work.&rdquo;        

Traffic is ever thinner on Abidjan&rsquo;s highways, though the motorcades of top officials still barrel down them at top speed, sirens blaring.        

Some analysts say Mr. Gbagbo will not last past May. A rise in the price of fuel could stoke large-scale popular discontent, others maintain. Still others say that every day Mr. Gbagbo remains in power is a victory for him.        

&ldquo;He&rsquo;s losing ground, but he still has the upper hand,&rdquo; another diplomat said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see the endgame here.&rdquo;
