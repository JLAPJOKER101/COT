MOSCOW &mdash; Nine people drowned when a riverboat collided with a barge in the Moscow River early Sunday, three weeks after a major cruise boat disaster on the Volga River that has caused anger and soul-searching over the dilapidated state of Russia&rsquo;s river fleet.        

Investigators said the captain of the Moscow riverboat, who died in the accident, had faced civil charges three times for violating operating rules and that his vessel, with 16 passengers aboard, was overloaded, according to a report carried by the Interfax news agency.        

The collision occurred about 1 a.m. in a roughly 200-yard-wide bend in the river in southwest Moscow, near Luzhniki Stadium and not far from the Kremlin.        

Three weeks ago, a riverboat packed with families sank in the Volga River, killing 122 people, including 28 children. That disaster led President Dmitri A. Medvedev to complain that far too many old ships, which he called &ldquo;tubs,&rdquo; were sailing Russia&rsquo;s rivers.        

In the Volga River case, the police arrested the director of a tour company and a senior riverboat inspector who had recently signed off on the vessel, the Bulgaria, as seaworthy.        

Russia has suffered a series of air and river disasters, many caused by outdated equipment, sloppy maintenance and ineffective inspections. &ldquo;The &lsquo;old tub&rsquo; is our entire state,&rdquo; said Vladimir Varfolomeyev, deputy editor at the radio station Ekho Moskvy, in one of many bitter comments.        

Interfax reported that investigators were using diving equipment on Sunday as they examined the scene and that a criminal case had been opened for violation of safety rules.        

It quoted the deputy mayor in charge of transport, Nikolai Lyamov: &ldquo;The causes for the shipwreck must be examined to the end before drawing serious conclusions, of course. What can the commentary be? Plenty of breaches of law.&rdquo;
