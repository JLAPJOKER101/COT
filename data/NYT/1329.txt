The government carried out a campaign of intimidation to deter a demonstration inspired by the uprisings in Egypt and Tunisia, Human Rights Watch reported Thursday. The protest, planned for March 7, did not occur. The group said the police arrested journalists and activists, as well as 17 young rap musicians who were reading poems and distributing pamphlets. Leaders of three opposition parties received anonymous death threats by phone and text messages, Human Rights Watch reported.
