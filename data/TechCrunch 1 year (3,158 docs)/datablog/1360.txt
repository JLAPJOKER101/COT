The Gillmor Gang — Danny Sullivan, Robert Scoble, John Taschek, and Steve Gillmor — turned what @dannysullivan called a minor upgrade into a major landmark event. Not that Danny agreed with him, but @scobleizer thinks the new iPad will soon make flying an exercise in screen jealousy as millions upgrade when they land. @jtaschek was too busy signing me up for a new one to disagree. I call it iPad as a Service.The new iPad comes with two peripherals — a new cover and Apple TV 1080P. Hard to tell what else has changed in the hardware, but the stealth news is that Netflix is now an Apple partner. That means the realignment around AirPlay as the hub of the Apple information bus is now in full swing. From Garageband to iPhoto to iMovie, the new wave of iOS apps will now be back ported to the Mac, not the other way around.@stevegillmor, @scobleizer, @dannysullivan, @jtaschekProduced and directed by Tina Chase Gillmor @tinagillmor
