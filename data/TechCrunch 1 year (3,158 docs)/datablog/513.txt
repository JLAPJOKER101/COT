Apples new MacBook Pro with Retina display definitely pushes the idea of what a modern screen should look like forward, but it also means developers will have to adapt their apps to these high resolutions to make sure their apps dont look bad. During its announcement earlier this week, Apple said that both Adobe and Autodesk were already working Retina-optimized versions of their products (though both now say that it will still be a while before their software will be ready). It looks like Google will be a bit faster. The company today announced that its first attempt at making Chrome ready for these high-resolution displays is already available in its highly experimental Canary channel. Google says it is committed to polishing Chrome until it shines on that machine.Canary builds are Googles most experimental and bleeding edge versions of Chrome (even more so than the dev channel). These builds are not tested before they are released and there is even a good chance that they wont even run. If you are one of the few lucky ones who already got their hands on a new MacBook Pro with Retina display, though, you can now see what Chrome should look like on these machines (Apples own Safari, of course, already renders text in high-res on these new screens).Google says that this current build already shows the early results of its work on bringing high-resolution support to Chrome. There is still more work to be done, but the developers are off to the races to make Chrome as beautiful as it can be.
