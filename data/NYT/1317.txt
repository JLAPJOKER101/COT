KATMANDU, Nepal (AP) &mdash; Krishna Prasad Bhattarai, a former prime minister who led a popular movement to restore multiparty democracy to Nepal in 1990, died here last Friday. He was 87.        

The cause was multiple organ failure, said Mr. Bhattarai&rsquo;s physician, Dr. Bharat Rawat.        

Mr. Bhattarai served as prime minister twice, beginning his first term in 1990. He served again in 1999 and 2000.        

After multiparty democracy was restored in 1990, he was appointed prime minister of an interim government comprising representatives from his Nepali Congress Party and several Communist parties.        

During his year in power, he conducted Nepal&rsquo;s first free elections in 30 years and enforced a new Constitution that guaranteed democratic rights.        

He became prime minister again at the end of the decade after the Congress Party won elections. Feuds in that faction-ridden party, however, forced him to step down after nine months.        

As prime minister, Mr. Bhattarai made official visits to India, Japan and Britain, and led the Nepalese delegation to a meeting of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation in 1990 in the Maldives. His strong stands against corruption and nepotism helped him gain popularity.        

Mr. Bhattarai spent nearly 14 years in prison for opposing the autocratic system imposed in Nepal in 1960.
