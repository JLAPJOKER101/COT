SignNow, a startup that develops an e-signing service, has raised $2 million in funding from Khosla Ventures. SignNow raised $500,000 in a previous round.SignNows goal is to revolutionize consumer use of e-signatures and eliminate the need for fax machines, scanners and printers. Today, the company is also announcing a free iPad app (joining iPhone and Android apps), which allows people to sign any document from their iPad and get other peopleâ€™s signatures.Heres how SignNow works. First, a user opens a document from their email or Dropbox. Next, they sign with a finger or invite someone to sign with a convenient email link. If they have a free account, documents are automatically saved to their SignNow account, making them accessible from anywhere and securely stored for reference.SignNow is the company behind NotaryNow, a service that allows people to connect to a notary instantly, via webcam, to legally notarize documents. The company faces competition from DocuSign and Echosign (which was acquired by Adobe).
