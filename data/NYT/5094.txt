Turkey is proposing that the United Nations create a commission to mediate an agreement on revenue sharing between Greek and Turkish Cypriots before any gas exploration begins off the divided island in the Mediterranean. Prime Minister Najib Mikati of Lebanon said he had agreed to hold off on any accord in an area of ocean where the claims of Cyprus, Lebanon and Israel overlap until the mediation is completed. Diplomats said that an agreement between Lebanon and Cyprus would virtually assure that the three countries agreed to the demarcation of their exploration zones. Turkey has threatened to use warships to prevent any drilling until there is an agreement between the Cypriots about the proceeds.
