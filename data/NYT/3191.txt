Youths clashed with riot police officers during a visit by King Abdullah II to Tafileh, a long-neglected tribal area 125 miles south of the capital, in a rare outburst of anger surrounding a royal event. About 30 riot police officers were hurt and five police cars were burned. Youths in Tafileh had been protesting against corruption and had wanted to meet the king, left, a request that was denied. A government spokesman said the clashes occurred as people rushed to salute the king. In a nod to protesters the king pledged Sunday that in the future the government would be elected, rather than appointed, but he set no timetable for the change.
