Bolivia&rsquo;s highest court on Tuesday convicted five former top military commanders of genocide for an army crackdown on riots over poverty and political marginalization in October 2003 that killed at least 64 civilians. The former commanders received sentences ranging from 10 to 15 years in prison. The court, the Supreme Tribunal, also convicted two former cabinet ministers of complicity in the killings and sentenced each to three years. The 2003 protests and crackdown provided a turning point in Bolivian politics: The president was forced into exile, the country&rsquo;s traditional political parties collapsed, and Evo Morales, one of the protest leaders, won the presidency two years later.
