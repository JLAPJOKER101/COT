The dean of St. Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral, the Very Rev. Graeme Knowles, resigned on Monday over anticapitalist protests that have spilled across the forecourt of the historic church, becoming the third clergy member to do so. He said his position had become &ldquo;untenable&rdquo; as criticism of the cathedral had grown in the press and among the public. Although he said he recognized the protesters&rsquo; right to assemble, he had urged them to leave the cathedral area so it could fully reopen to visitors.
