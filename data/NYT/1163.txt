VATICAN CITY (AP) &mdash; In a new book, Pope Benedict XVI makes a sweeping exoneration of the Jewish people for the death of Jesus Christ.        

The Second Vatican Council made a similar declaration in 1965. But Benedict is the first pope to personally do so, and Jewish scholars said Wednesday that his arguments were a milestone attack on the &ldquo;foundation of anti-Semitic persecution.&rdquo;        

The book, &ldquo;Jesus of Nazareth &mdash; Part II,&rdquo; argues in detail that there is no biblical basis for the argument that the Jewish people as a whole were responsible.
