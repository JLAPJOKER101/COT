ISLAMABAD, Pakistan &mdash; A Pakistani court has ordered that former President Pervez Musharraf&rsquo;s property be seized and his bank accounts frozen in connection with the legal case concerning the assassination of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto.        

The court order was issued Saturday by Judge Shahid Raffique at a hearing in Rawalpindi, the garrison city next to Islamabad where Mrs. Bhutto was killed in a gun and suicide bomb attack on Dec. 27, 2007.        

Mr. Musharraf was charged in the case earlier this year, but he left the country in 2008 under threat of impeachment and has been living in exile in London and Dubai.        

He has not appeared at any court hearing in the case.        

During the hearing on Saturday, the judge ordered the Federal Investigation Agency to confiscate all of Mr. Musharraf&rsquo;s property for failing to respond to subpoenas.        

At the time of the assassination, Mr. Musharraf&rsquo;s government had accused the Taliban and Al Qaeda of being behind the plot to kill Mrs. Bhutto, his political rival.        

A United Nations report released in April 2010 suggested that Pakistani authorities had deliberately failed to effectively investigate the killing, but it did not say who it believed to be responsible for her death.        

Last October, Mr. Musharraf apologized to Pakistan for what he characterized as mistakes he made in office, and he said he would return to the country in time for elections due by 2013.        

A spokesman for Mr. Musharraf said that the court&rsquo;s ruling was &ldquo;politically motivated.&rdquo;        

&ldquo;We expect no justice from the existing judiciary, which has a strong bias against our leader,&rdquo; Fawad Chaudhry, a spokesman for Mr. Musharraf&rsquo;s new political party, the All Pakistan Muslim League, was quoted as saying by the local news media.        

&ldquo;We will respond to such bias in the people&rsquo;s court,&rdquo; he said.
