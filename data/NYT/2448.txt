Three people have been detained in the recent cafe bombing in Marrakesh that killed 16 people, the Interior Ministry said Thursday. The three Moroccans include the person suspected of being the main perpetrator of the April 28 bombing of the Argana cafe, a top tourist destination. The ministry said the main suspect has links to Al Qaeda. A statement said he &ldquo;made many attempts to go to such hot spots as Chechnya and Iraq&rdquo; before carrying out the Marrakesh attack.
