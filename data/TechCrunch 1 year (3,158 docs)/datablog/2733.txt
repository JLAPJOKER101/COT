50 Cents wireless headphones are finally nearing release and I just received multiple pics and a full spec sheet concerning the upcoming high-end model. Sync by 50 uses the now-popular unibody casing but features full on-board playback controls  something no other headphones can proclaim. Housed in each can is a 40mm driver, which is surrounded by a memory foam cushion. The 3.5mm wireless adapter is said to broadcast the signal 50 feet and somehow allow four simultaneous wireless connections through an unnamed wireless standard. The spec sheet brags that the headphones features a professionally tuned digital EQ along with 16-bit lossless digital sound. The headset apparently charges through micro USB and ships with a wired mic cable (classy) and a hard-shell carrying case. However, the spec sheet doesnt state the price or release date.These headphones have had a long journey. 50 Cent (or one of his many companies) teamed up with Sleek Audio last year who later proudly displayed their joint effort at CES. That deal fell through last May. Curtis 50 Cent Jacksons SMS Audio then picked up the project and later bought KonoAudio whose founder is now the president at SMS Audio. 50 Cent joins Dr. Dre and Ludacris in the headphone game. My source couldnt dig up the price but indicated that this model along with a wired headset and earbuds will launch within the coming months. However, dont expect these to be inexpensive. Beats By Dr. Dre showed theres a market for premium lifestyle headphones and this model seems to employ a fair balance of style and technology. Its going to be pricey.
