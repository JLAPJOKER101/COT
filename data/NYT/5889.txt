As the death toll from an earthquake on Wednesday rose to 12 in the city of Van, the riot police fired tear gas and used batons to disperse scores of protesters angry at the state&rsquo;s relief efforts for a deadlier quake that hit the same area two weeks ago. &ldquo;How can you fire pepper spray on people who have already suffered so much?&rdquo; asked Abdulrahim Kaplan, 32. He said he had gone to a crisis center seeking a tent for his family when the police began firing tear gas. Thousands of families are living in makeshift camps as temperatures fall to freezing with the onset of winter. Some of those killed in the latest quake were buried under buildings they moved into that turned out to have been fatally weakened by the earlier temblor.
