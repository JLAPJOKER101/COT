NewMe Accelerator, the startup incubator program aimed at under-represented minorities in the tech industry (namely African Americans, Latinos, and women), announced today that it has chosen seven startups to be part of its Summer/Fall 2012 cycle.One thing that really sets NewMe apart is that it is a residential program, so the founders all move into one house together where they all eat, sleep, and breathe the startup building experience. The aim is to hack on their respective projects day and night, in between meetings with a star-studded group of mentors such as Mitch Kapor and Ben Horowitz. This next batch of startups will move into NewMes San Francisco house on August 13th, and stay there for 12 weeks. Here are the seven startups that will make up NewMes third class:The NewMe Accelerator was founded just last year, so while it is still in its early days it seems to be hitting its stride. TechCrunch TV talked to NewMe founder Angela Benton at the programs Spring 2012 Demo Day about how NewMe has grown so far  you can watch that interview in the video embedded below:
