Iran has started the nuclear reaction at its Bushehr power plant, the Russian company that built the reactor said in a statement on Tuesday that indicated Iran is close to wrapping up work on the site that has dragged on for more than three decades. The German company Siemens abandoned the partly completed plant after the 1979 Islamic revolution in Iran, and more delays followed even after Russia resumed construction in 1994. The United States once opposed the plant. But the International Atomic Energy Agency monitors it, and the United States dropped its objections after Russia provided assurances of controls on the fuel supply and the disposal of spent fuel rods. The Russian state company that builds reactors abroad said that operators at the plant would test safety and control equipment before connecting the reactor to electricity generating turbines, a process that could take about two months.
