Startup Personal, which aims to give consumers control over their digital data, is debuting an iPhone app today, adding to the companys existing web and Android apps.Personal is a free web and mobile service that helps you take control of all the digital information about yourself and your life, decide who gets access to it, and use it for your benefit. This information ranges from your passwords, your kids allergies, emergency contacts, credit card info, and more. Basically, any information you may not want to store in email but want to be able to share with your loved ones or friends.With Personal you can store various information in data vaults where you can selectively share certain vaults with people. Of course, all accounts on Personal include a legal guarantee that you own your data in the system. At the very heart of Personal, are what the startup calls gems. Gems are nuggets of reusable information that represent the details of your life – your family, pets, car, home, office, food and travel preferences, and more.  You can decide which gems to add to your vault and which to share with others using our grant and request features. And you can download existing data from LinkedIn and Facebook. Personal also has a Gem Gallery, which is where you browse for the gems you need to use.Using the iPhone app, Personal users can access all of their Gems, including logins and passwords, grant temporary access to their Wi-Fi info to guests at home or the office so they can quickly log on, give users access to loyalty programs and more.The bonus of having this information stored in a mobile app is that you can access all of this on the go and share this information from anywhere.The startup has raised $7.6 million in funding from Steve Cases Revolution LLC, Allen&Company, and others.
