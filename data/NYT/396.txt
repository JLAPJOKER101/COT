RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (Reuters) &mdash; King Abdullah, Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s elderly and ailing ruler, arrived in Morocco on Saturday to convalesce after spending almost two months in New York for medical treatment, the official Saudi Press Agency reported.        

The agency said that King Abdullah, who is in his late 80s, was in Casablanca, where he often spends holidays. It gave no date for when he would return to Saudi Arabia.        

The king left Riyadh on Nov. 22 and underwent two operations in New York after a blood clot complicated a slipped disk.        

The press agency did not publish a picture of the king, who arrived in New York in a wheelchair but was seen walking after leaving the hospital on Dec. 22.        

The king ascended to the throne in 2005.        

The Saudis have taken pains to assure their allies that there will be no power vacuum even as health problems affect its octogenarian rulers. But the king&rsquo;s recent medical problems have aroused concern over whether a reformer like him, or a conservative, would succeed him.        

Crown Prince Sultan, who has health problems of his own, returned from a vacation in Morocco to govern in King Abdullah&rsquo;s absence.        

Because both the king and Crown Prince Sultan are in their 80s, speculation has arisen that the interior minister, Prince Nayef, a 76-year-old conservative who is viewed as a religious and social traditionalist, could take over running the affairs of state in the future.
