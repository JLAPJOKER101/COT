A company building a hydroelectric power plant confirmed Wednesday that 17 of its workers had died and seven were critically injured as a result of the earthquake that shook the Himalayas in and around the northeastern Indian state of Sikkim on Sunday. The state&rsquo;s chief minister, Pawan Chamling, told reporters that 68 people had been killed in Sikkim, and that the property damage exceeded $20 billion. Indian soldiers and rescue workers raced to clear debris and rescue those who remained trapped by landslides. &ldquo;Relief work is going on at war footing,&rdquo; Mr. Chamling said. &ldquo;All the roads are broken and damaged. All the water pipelines are damaged. All the electric lines are damaged and disrupted. It will take months to repair all that.&rdquo; Officials at the company building the plant on the upper reaches of the Teesta River said in a statement that none of the workers had been on duty because it was a Sunday, but had been killed by landslides.
