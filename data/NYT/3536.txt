President Omar Hassan al-Bashir said the army would continue its campaign in Southern Kordofan State, the state news agency SUNA said Friday, dashing hope of a cease-fire. Mr. Bashir seemed to contradict comments by a northern official who said this week that the north and the south had agreed &ldquo;in principle&rdquo; to a cease-fire. SUNA reported that Mr. Bashir &ldquo;directed the armed forces to continue their military operations in South Kordofan until a cleansing of the region is over.&rdquo; Fighting between the northern military and southern-aligned armed groups broke out in Southern Kordofan on June 5.
