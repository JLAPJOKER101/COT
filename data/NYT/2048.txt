MEXICO CITY &mdash; The authorities have arrested 16 police officers and charged them with protecting a criminal gang suspected of murdering dozens of people and dumping their bodies in farmland about 90 miles south of the Texas border.        

The arrests, announced late Wednesday, suggest how it was possible for the gang to operate for months in San Fernando, an unpopulated area in Tamaulipas State, where people have vanished after being kidnapped from long-distance buses.        

Security forces said Thursday that they had now found 145 bodies in mass graves.        

Officials said last week that the discovery of dozens of bodies might offer an answer to the mystery of what happened to men who had been forced off buses at gunpoint in front of witnesses.
