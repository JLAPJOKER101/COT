Afghanistan opened bids Tuesday on billions of dollars worth of copper and gold deposits in four areas of the country that, together, equal roughly half the Grand Canyon. The Afghan Ministry of Mines invited investors to bid on multiple contracts to unearth copper and gold hidden beneath 846 square miles in Badakhshan, Ghazni and Herat Provinces and a fourth area that spans both Balkh and Sar-i-Pul Provinces. Despite continuing violence, Afghanistan is hopeful that its mining industry will generate billions in revenue to help rebuild after 30 years of war. For a landlocked country with virtually no exports, the minerals are a potential windfall but will require international investment, better transportation and improved security.
