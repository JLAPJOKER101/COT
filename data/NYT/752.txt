A British journalist who was expelled from Russia over the weekend is considering an offer from the Russian Foreign Ministry to receive a new visa and return to work in Moscow, his newspaper said Wednesday. The journalist, Luke Harding of The Guardian, left, was detained after landing at a Moscow airport and sent back to London despite having a  journalist&rsquo;s visa in his passport.    Russian officials at first refused to explain why Mr. Harding was deported, then said that he had violated rules for foreign correspondents because he did not pick up a press card. Mr. Harding and his editors have suggested that he was expelled because Russian authorities were displeased with his coverage. On Wednesday, it appeared that the Russian Foreign Ministry was all but acknowledging that the authorities had made a mistake and were trying to persuade Mr. Harding to return.
