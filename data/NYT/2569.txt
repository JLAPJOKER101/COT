TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) &mdash; Former President Manuel Zelaya is expected to return to Honduras within a month, ending an exile that began nearly two years ago when he was ousted in a coup, an aide and a key supporter said Wednesday.        

Conditions are right for Mr. Zelaya to return from the Dominican Republic after the Honduran Supreme Court dropped corruption charges against him, said Rasel Tom&eacute;, a senior aide of the former president.        

&ldquo;He has the will and desire to return to his homeland,&rdquo; Mr. Tom&eacute; said in an interview.        

Mr. Zelaya&rsquo;s return could pave the way for Honduras to be reincorporated into the Organization of American States, which suspended the country after the coup in June 2009.        

The United States and many other countries in the hemisphere have long since restored diplomatic ties with Honduras, but some nations, including Venezuela and Brazil, have declined to do so.        

Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said she was confident that the O.A.S. would restore Honduras.        

&ldquo;Now that the obstacles to former President Zelaya&rsquo;s return to Honduras have been removed, I am confident that we will soon welcome Honduras back as a full member of the inter-American system,&rdquo; Mrs. Clinton said Wednesday at the 41st Conference on the Americas in Washington. &ldquo;That is a step that is long overdue.&rdquo;        

Juan Barahona, a leader of the pro-Zelaya National Popular Resistance Front, said that Mr. Zelaya intended to return to Honduras before a meeting of the O.A.S. General Assembly in El Salvador on June 5.        

&ldquo;The day and hour that he will return has not been determined, but we will announce it publicly so that a massive number of people can welcome him at the airport,&rdquo; Mr. Barahona said.        

Mr. Zelaya was ousted by the military in a dispute over his efforts to change the Honduran Constitution.
