The North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il, reiterated Friday that he would return to the so-called six-party talks on his country&rsquo;s nuclear program with no preconditions, Xinhua, the Chinese state news agency, reported. Mr. Kim made his remarks in Heilongjiang Province, which borders North Korea, after meeting with the Russian president, Dmitri A. Medvedev, in Siberia on Wednesday, where he first offered to return to the talks. The United States, a leader in the talks, has expressed skepticism over the use of holding more of them. In China, Mr. Kim met with Dai Bingguo, the senior foreign policy official.
