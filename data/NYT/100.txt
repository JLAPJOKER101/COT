The man recognized by foreign powers as the winner of the recent presidential election here, Alassane Ouattara, called Thursday for a &ldquo;special operations&rdquo; raid to seize the incumbent, Laurent Gbagbo, and &ldquo;take him somewhere else.&rdquo; Mr. Gbagbo refuses to give up power nearly six weeks after an election the United Nations, the United States and African nations say he lost. Meanwhile, the United States Treasury announced it was freezing Mr. Gbagbo&rsquo;s assets, and the United Nations said some 31 people had died in Ivory Coast in post-election violence in the last week, bringing the total to more than 200. The United Nations peacekeeping chief in New York called for reinforcements to bolster the embattled mission of close to 10,000 here, which Mr. Gbagbo is seeking to expel.
