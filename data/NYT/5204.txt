ISLAMABAD, Pakistan &mdash; Gunmen opened fire on a bus in southwestern Pakistan on Tuesday, killing at least 13 Shiite Muslims and wounding seven, officials said.        

The attack took place on the outskirts of Quetta, the capital of Baluchistan Province, and appeared to follow what is becoming a grim pattern in which Sunnis belonging to the extremist sectarian group Lashkar-e-Jhangvi in the region attack minority Shiites, who are mostly members of the Hazara ethnic group.        

On Tuesday morning, attackers riding in a pickup truck intercepted the bus carrying mostly Shiite day laborers traveling to a market. The gunmen forced non-Hazara passengers to get off the bus, then opened fire on the people remaining inside, said Abdul Khaliq Hazara, chairman of the Hazara Democratic Party.        

The wounded were taken to a hospital in Quetta.        

The laborers earn about $2.30 a day. &ldquo;They are extremely poor people,&rdquo; Mr. Hazara said.        

The episode set off protests by Shiites, who condemned the government for failing to ensure their safety. The bus was set on fire by enraged protesters at the hospital where the wounded had been taken. Protesters also blocked the main highway on the outskirts of Quetta.        

Tuesday&rsquo;s shootings came nearly two weeks after gunmen attacked a bus in Baluchistan carrying Shiite pilgrims to Iran, killing at least 25. Lashkar-e-Jhangvi claimed responsibility for that attack, which took place about 30 miles south of Quetta.        

Attacks on Shiite pilgrims traveling to Iran through Baluchistan have been frequent. A year ago, 57 people at a Shiite rally in Quetta were killed by a suicide bomber.
