Spreecast, a social video platform that lets people broadcast together, is adding the ability to embed spreecasts on their blogs, free of charge.The brainchild of StubHub co-founder and investor Jeff Fluhr, Spreecast can be used publicly or privately to create interactive, social online video broadcasts. Up to 4 people at a time can be face-to-face, streaming their conversation live while hundreds of others can watch, chat, and participate by submitting comments and questions to those on-screen. Viewers can also request to join on camera, while producers of the Spreecast can manage the action. Spreecast is also integrated with Facebook, Twitter, and Google+ so that producers and creators can broadcast their conversations to their friends, followers, circles, contacts and connections.For Spreecast, adding the ability to embed these video broadcasts is another way to let people take part in the conversations happening on the platform. Spreecasts can be embedded with a simple line of code in any blog or post. The embedded video comes in multiple sizes and includes a two-way video screen, built-in chat room, customizable Twitter stream, and Facebook Comments. Weve actually embedded a conversation between Chris Kelly, the former Chief Privacy Officer of Facebook, and 4INFO founder Zaw Thet below (which will start as 10:30 PT). Spreecast has raised $4 million in funding from Frank Biondi, former CEO of Viacom; Gordon Crawford, media and technology investor at The Capital Research Group and Edward Scott, Jr., founder of BEA Systems.
