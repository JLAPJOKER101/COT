The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, known as Unesco, will trim its budget, restrict travel and publications, put all spending under review, and freeze any new projects between now and the end of the year after the United States withdrew its funding, its director general, Irina Bokova, said Thursday. Washington stopped providing funding, including about $65 million for the 2011 budget, after Unesco admitted the Palestinians as a full member. The United States has said it had no choice because legislation dating back to the 1990s mandates a complete cutoff of money to any United Nations agency that accepts the Palestinians as a full member. The United States provides 22 percent of the Unesco budget, and the withdrawal of funding has thrown the organization into crisis. Also on Thursday, Gabon announced that it would provide an extra $2 million for this year&rsquo;s budget.
