The Vatican said Thursday that it would take legal action to prevent the distribution of an advertisement by the Benetton clothing company showing Pope Benedict XVI kissing a prominent Egyptian imam. The Vatican said it had told its lawyers in Italy and abroad to &ldquo;take the proper legal measures&rdquo; to block the use of an altered photo it considered &ldquo;damaging to not only to the dignity of the pope and the Catholic Church but also to the feelings of believers.&rdquo; Responding to earlier protests, Benetton said Wednesday that it would withdraw the ad, part of a campaign of photo montages showing religious and political leaders kissing. A company spokesman apologized for causing offense, saying the ad campaign was intended to combat hatred.
