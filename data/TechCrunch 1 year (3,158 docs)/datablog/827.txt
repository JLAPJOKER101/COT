Covering the tech scene in San Francisco, it sometimes seems like theres a hackathon every weekend. But the folks behind AngelHack are thinking a little bigger than normal for their summer event.Theyre calling it the first hackathon to unite startup communities nationwide. On the weekend of June 23-24, AngelHack will be hosting four simultaneous hackathons in the New York City, San Francisco, Boston, and Seattle areas. The top 20 teams will then get three weeks of mentorship from AngelHack partners, including Lean Startup Machine (a workshop on lean startup methodology).The goal is to create a real product that the teams can bring to Palo Alto on July 12, for the grand finals, where theyll present to a panel of judges that Microsoft VP Scott Guthrie, Right Side Capitals David Lambert, and, uh, me. The two big winners will receive $25,000 in seed funding from Right Side and Instanta Capital.Oh, and apparently my fellow TechCrunch writer Rip Empson will be hosting the July event. Though to be clear, as far as I know, theres no official relationship between TechCrunch and AngelHack â€” it just so happens that Rip and I both said yes. Anyway, its a nice surprise, since I never see that guy.
