The cancellation of a music festival this weekend in Suzhou has some musicians and festival organizers fearing they may be swept up in the government crackdown on dissent. Organizers of the Strawberry music festival said this week that the event was canceled because of recent rainstorms. But artists have speculated that it was canceled because of official pressure after the name of a detained artist, Ai Weiwei, was flashed on a big screen at a music festival last weekend in Jiangsu Province. Days later, Zuoxiao Zuzhou, a rock musician who expressed support for Mr. Ai at that festival and in a newspaper article, was detained by police officers.
