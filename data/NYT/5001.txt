SANA, Yemen &mdash; A tenuous truce showed signs of falling apart on Thursday here in Yemen&rsquo;s capital, as clashes intensified between government forces and troops loyal to a military commander who defected months ago to protect antigovernment protesters.        

The cease-fire announced late Tuesday between the groups was always fragile; it was made public by the vice president, Abed Rabbo Mansour al-Hadi, but it was never clear that powerful military leaders agreed.        

On Wednesday, the violence between the groups ebbed. On Thursday, however, there was more fighting, including some in a neighborhood that had been relatively quiet.        

There was also fighting in another area of the city between government forces and rebel tribesmen loyal to the powerful Ahmar family, which has been pushing for the ouster of President Ali Abdullah Saleh.        

The revolt against the longtime president, modeled after Arab Spring rebellions elsewhere, has churned on for months, with occasional bloody crackdowns on the demonstrators.        

But the violence since the weekend appears to have unleashed renewed attacks on the sit-in by demonstrators in Sana; direct attacks on the sit-in had been rare since the spring.        

Sniper fire, mortar attacks and rocket-propelled grenades have all struck the sit-in area, which is in front of Sana University, in the past two days.        

On Thursday, at least seven civilians were killed by what appeared to be sniper fire, according to the head doctor at the field hospital that treats wounded demonstrators. That brings the total number of deaths from violence in the city to around 70 since Sunday. Most of those killed have been protesters or other civilians, many of them caught in the cross-fire between fighters.        

At the protesters&rsquo; tent city, which stretches for more than a mile down the Ring Road in Sana, they are bracing for more attacks, but some said that only strengthened their resolve.
