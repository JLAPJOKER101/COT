The French police took a former government minister into custody on Monday for questioning about accusations of sexual assault by at least two women employees. The former minister, Georges Tron, resigned May 29 over allegations that he persuaded women who worked in the town hall where he was mayor into letting him massage their feet, which turned into groping. The women came forward, inspired, they said, by the New York hotel chambermaid who has accused Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the former director of the International Monetary Fund, of attempted rape. Mr. Tron was reportedly confronted by three women during the questioning, Agence France-Presse reported. He has not been charged in the case.
