One of the cooler gadgets we saw at Disrupt this year was the new Retriever GPS dog tracker. Completely redesigned, this device lets you track Fido wherever he does roam and will let people know where to take him or her if lost.The device lasts about a week on one charge and will go into sleep mode if it hasnt been activated in a while. I sat down with the company founders and their stuffed dog, Gibby, to discuss the technology.Product Page
