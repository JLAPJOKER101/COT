So, youve upgraded to iOS 5. Look at all the new shiny things! iMessage! Notification Center! Newsstand!Wait, Newsstand? A special folder just for digital magazines and newspapers? Meh! Lets just go ahead and delete th oh, you cant. Its okay, well just put it into another folder and nope, you cant do that either.Well, you can — youre just not supposed to. The Internet Hivemind has found a way.The trick (as first noted by The Coding Massacre) is simple (no jailbreak required!), but requires some lightning quick fingers. In what is quite obviously some sort of bug, it appears that theres about a half second window after the creation of a folder wherein its not set to automatically reject Newsstand.As its a bug, the trick has a catch or two: Newsstand not only becomes completely non-functional when tucked into another folder, but itll actually make the homescreen freak out and quickly reset if you try to open it. Still, its better than having an icon you never use on your homescreen until the end of time.Also, you probably shouldnt expect this trick to work indefinitely. Given the whacky homescreen-crashing side effects, Apple will undoubtedly fix it before too long — but hopefully, theyll supplant it with something a bit less hacky.
