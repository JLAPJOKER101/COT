Chinese defense officials denounced Friday a Pentagon report that called China&rsquo;s military buildup &ldquo;potentially destabilizing,&rdquo; Xinhua reported. The Pentagon report, released Wednesday, asserted that China&rsquo;s military modernization could lead to regional tensions and instability. &ldquo;The report does not hold water as it severely distorted the facts,&rdquo; a Chinese Defense Ministry spokesman, Yang Yujun, said in a statement. He added, &ldquo;China unswervingly adheres to the path of peaceful development, and its national defense policy is defensive in nature.&rdquo;
