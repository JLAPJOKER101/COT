Iran announced the mass production of a new cruise missile on Wednesday, the latest in a series of belligerent-sounding proclamations from that country in the face of its increased isolation by a Western-led group of nations worried about Iran&rsquo;s nuclear program and avowed hostility toward Israel. Brig. Gen. Ahmad Vahidi, Iran&rsquo;s defense minister, said the new missile, first unveiled a month ago and known as the Qader, which means able in Persian, had been mass-produced &ldquo;as quickly as possible,&rdquo; the country&rsquo;s state-run media reported. The missile, designed to destroy warships and coastal targets, has a range of about 125 miles, the news media said.
