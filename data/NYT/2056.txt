The United Nations confirmed the claims of an Iranian dissident group on Thursday that dozens of Iranian exiles were killed by Iraqi security forces last week at a camp north of Baghdad. A spokesman for the United Nations said that 34 members of the group, the People&rsquo;s Mujahedeen, had been killed near Camp Ashraf, in Diyala Province. The statement contradicted the claims of Iraqi officials, who denied that Iraqi security forces fired on the group.
