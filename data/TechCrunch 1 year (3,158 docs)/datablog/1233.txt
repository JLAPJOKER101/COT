Apples third-generation Apple TV didnt really enjoy the limelight upon arrival. Something flashier stole the show. But its still an important product, especially considering that the way we consume media is rapidly changing. Matt and I discuss this, and actually end up arguing a little bit more than I expected, in this episode of Fly or Die. In fact, the conversation actually delves into the way both Matt and I feel Apple has changed the tech ecosystem. But as far as Apple TV goes, were both fans. Upgraded innards, including 1080p playback courtesy of that A5 chip and upgraded RAM, only leave new buyers without a reason to resist. Current Apple TV owners may even be swayed by the fact that they can now view 1080p and enjoy the magic of AirPlay for another hundo. Its an easy fly.
