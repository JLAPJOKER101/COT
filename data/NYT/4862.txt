At least two million tons of cooking oil are recycled illegally every year and used by restaurants in China, posing a serious health hazard to diners, according to a report on Thursday on the Web site of Xinhua, the state news agency. Recycled oil has become an increasing concern as the country tries to grapple with food safety issues. On Wednesday, Chinese news organizations reported the police had detained 32 people who are part of a ring spanning 14 provinces that collected recycled oil and peddled it at a discount to restaurants.
