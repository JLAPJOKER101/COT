A jury convicted a former British Airways computer specialist on Monday of plotting with Anwar al-Awlaki, an American-born extremist cleric, to blow up an airplane in an attack intended to kill hundreds. Rajib Karim, a 31-year-old Bangladeshi man, was convicted of four counts of engaging in preparation for terrorist attacks. He had already pleaded guilty to five other terrorism offenses, but denied plotting an attack in Britain. He is due to be sentenced March 18.
