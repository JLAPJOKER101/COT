Israel asked the United Nations on Friday to help prevent activists from sailing to Gaza on the anniversary of the Israeli raid on a Turkish ship that tried to breach the blockade of the territory last May. The Free Gaza Movement, a pro-Palestinian activist group that sponsored the flotilla last year, said 15 ships with international passengers would sail for Gaza next month. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told the United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, that the flotilla &ldquo;was being organized by Islamic extremist elements, among others, with the goal of creating a provocation and bringing about a flare-up,&rdquo; Mr. Netanyahu&rsquo;s office said. When Israel stopped the flotilla last year, Israeli marines killed nine Turkish activists in fighting aboard the lead ship.
