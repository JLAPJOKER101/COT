Interior Minister Claude Gu&eacute;ant confirmed Thursday for the first time that the Central Directorate of Interior Intelligence had requisitioned the telephone records of a reporter for the newspaper Le Monde in an effort to trace the source of a leak in a politically charged case. The reporter, G&eacute;rard Davet, had obtained leaked police testimony in the case, a tangled controversy over claims of tax evasion and political malfeasance involving the L&rsquo;Or&eacute;al heiress Liliane Bettencourt, France&rsquo;s wealthiest woman and a supporter of President Nicolas Sarkozy&rsquo;s political party. Le Monde last year accused the government of violating a law protecting journalists during its investigation of the Bettencourt case. French laws protect the right of journalists to refuse to disclose the identity of confidential sources, and restrict communications surveillance to matters involving the &ldquo;defense of national interests.&rdquo; The government has said that any surveillance it employed in the Bettencourt case met that standard. Mr. Gu&eacute;ant said the government did not wiretap Mr. Davet&rsquo;s telephone but did review his telephone records.
