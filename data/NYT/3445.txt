Infant mortality in Equatorial Guinea appears to have declined since the discovery of oil in the 1990s, according to an assessment by the World Bank and other international agencies. Revising and ironing out contradictions in previous data, some of which found that infant mortality had risen despite an influx of oil money, the World Bank now says there appears to have been a drop, in line with a global fall in infant deaths. Still, the bank cautioned that the data were not complete. &ldquo;There should be a lot of uncertainty around both estimates,&rdquo; said Shanta Devarajan, the chief economist for the bank&rsquo;s Africa region.
