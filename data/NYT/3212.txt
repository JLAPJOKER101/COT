A specially appointed medical panel is recommending that Liliane Bettencourt, the elderly L&rsquo;Or&eacute;al heiress,&nbsp;be protected by a guardian because of her deteriorating health, according to the newspaper Le Monde. The panel&rsquo;s members did not examine Mrs. Bettencourt, 88, the newspaper said, but based their opinion on her medical records.&nbsp;Her lawyer, Pascal Wilhelm, declined to comment Tuesday &ldquo;due to the current situation.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mrs. Bettencourt&rsquo;s daughter, Fran&ccedil;oise Bettencourt-Meyers, has asked for court-appointed guardianship; France&rsquo;s highest appeals court will review the request to determine whether it can be imposed without Mrs. Bettencourt&rsquo;s support. &nbsp;
