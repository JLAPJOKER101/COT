To the intense rivalry between Israel and Iran add another facet: the game of chess.        

In a literal game of one-upmanship, an Iranian grandmaster played 614 people simultaneously on Tuesday and Wednesday at Shahid Beheshti University in Tehran in an attempt to break a world record set by an Israeli grandmaster last October.        

According to a report in Agence France-Presse, the Iranian, Ehsan Ghaem Maghami, 28, won 590 games, lost 8 and drew 16 in an exhibition that took 25 hours.        

The Israeli grandmaster, Alik Gershon, 30, played 523 games over 19 hours, beating 454, losing 11 and drawing 58.        

Mr. Gershon broke the previous record set by Morteza Mahjoob, 30, another Iranian grandmaster, in 2009. Mr. Maghami said after he finished playing Wednesday that he believed he had set a new record. He also said it was irrelevant that he was trying to break a record held by an Israeli. &ldquo;Iran is great and deserves the best,&rdquo; he told Agence France-Presse.        

Damien Field, a representative of Guinness World Records, said in an e-mail that the group had received a claim on behalf of Mr. Maghami but that it was awaiting supporting evidence. For the record to be official, a player has to win at least 80 percent of the games. Opponents must meet certain minimum standards of skill.
