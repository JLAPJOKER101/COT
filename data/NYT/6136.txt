A Mexican human rights lawyer, Netza&iacute; Sandoval, filed a complaint on Friday against President Felipe Calder&oacute;n with the International Criminal Court in The Hague, claiming that Mr. Calder&oacute;n covered up and tolerated war crimes and crimes against humanity. The document, signed by 23,000 Mexicans, also accuses organized crime syndicates, Public Security Minister Genaro Garc&iacute;a Luna, and the country&rsquo;s army and navy of partaking in the &ldquo;systematic repetition&rdquo; of abuses against civilians. Mr. Sandoval said he wanted to ensure that the court&rsquo;s chief prosecutor, Luis Moreno-Ocampo, begins monitoring the situation in Mexico, where more than 45,000 people have been killed since Mr. Calder&oacute;n began his offensive against drug traffickers in 2006.
