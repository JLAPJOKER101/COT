A month after the authorities began taxing Romania&rsquo;s witches and fortunetellers on their trade, Parliament is considering a new bill that would subject them to fines or even prison if their predictions do not come true. Superstition is taken seriously in Romania, and officials passed the tax bill in an effort to increase revenues. The new bill would also require witches to have permits and provide their customers with receipts, and it would bar them from practicing near schools and churches. Witches argue they should not be blamed for the failure of their tools. &ldquo;They can&rsquo;t condemn witches; they should condemn the cards,&rdquo; said Bratara Buzea, above, a &ldquo;queen witch.&rdquo;
