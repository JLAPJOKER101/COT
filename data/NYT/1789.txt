The International Court of Justice on Friday rejected a claim by the former Soviet republic of Georgia accusing Russia of ethnic cleansing in two rebel enclaves. The court, the judicial arm of the United Nations, ruled that it had no jurisdiction to decide the case, but made no decision on the merits of the accusation. In a statement on its Web site, the court said Georgia violated procedure by failing to hold direct talks with Russia over the dispute before going to court. Georgia filed the complaint in the midst of its war with Russia in August 2008, accusing Moscow of complicity in the forceful expulsion of ethnic Georgians from Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Both sides leveled accusations of ethnic cleansing during the war, though there has been no independent legal confirmation that such crimes occurred.
