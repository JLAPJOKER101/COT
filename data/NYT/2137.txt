Belarus announced Tuesday that it would allow its flagging currency to trade freely between banks, all but ensuring a devaluation of the ruble in an effort to ease an increasingly dire economic situation. The exchange rate had previously been fixed. Economists have said that the move would help jump-start the economy by lowering prices on exports, slowing the outflow of dollars and euros. But the decision will probably cause inflation to spike, further undermining confidence in Belarus&rsquo;s authoritarian president, Aleksandr G. Lukashenko. Soviet-style economic policies have depleted Belarus&rsquo;s foreign currency reserves, and people have been waiting in long lines to exchange rubles for increasingly scarce dollars and euros. The sense of crisis was compounded last week by a bombing at a subway station in the capital, Minsk, that killed 13 people.
