The American official responsible for overseeing how the billions of dollars in American aid to Afghanistan are spent resigned Monday, the White House said. The resignation of Arnold Fields, who was appointed special inspector general for Afghanistan&rsquo;s reconstruction by President George W. Bush in 2008, comes weeks after he was criticized by some members of Congress as not having been aggressive enough in tracking how the money had been spent. A senior White House official said Mr. Fields had not been asked to leave. In Mr. Fields&rsquo;s tenure, a White House statement said, his office &ldquo;produced numerous critical reports that have improved reconstruction efforts, and helped ensure that U.S. funded programs are achieving their objectives.&rdquo;
