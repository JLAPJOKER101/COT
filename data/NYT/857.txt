KABUL, Afghanistan &mdash; Afghanistan&rsquo;s top female official began a sustained verbal assault on women&rsquo;s shelters on Tuesday, accusing them of corruption and mismanagement, and insisting that the government was determined to take control of them, whether or not donors continue to give financial support.        

The shelters, nearly all of them supported by Western charities and governments, provide  havens for women and girls fleeing sexual and physical abuse, and give the runaways an alternative to seeking help from the authorities, who often forcibly return them to their families &mdash; and sometimes subject them to further abuse.        

The new rules would put government officials in charge of the shelters, provide close monitoring of their activities, and could subject unmarried girls in them to virginity tests, critics complain.        

&ldquo;These shelters do not care about the women in them, there are thousands of women living around them and they are not concerned about those women, they are not concerned about these women in the shelters, they are only concerned about their budgets,&rdquo; said Hussan Ghazanfar, the acting minister of women&rsquo;s affairs, at a news conference she called to defend the government&rsquo;s proposed new rules.        

Asserting that the country&rsquo;s 11 registered shelters spent $11 million last year taking care of 210 women, she said that was far more than needed. &ldquo;This is corruption, you can just count,&rdquo;  Ms. Ghazanfar said, claiming that the entire women&rsquo;s ministry has a total budget of only $1 million. &ldquo;The shelters do not need this much money.&rdquo;        

However, 210 is the number of women in those shelters when officials checked on Monday, she conceded. Many of the women stay briefly until they can reconcile with their families or find an alternative living arrangement. They range from girls forced into child marriage to rape victims fleeing relatives who would kill them to assuage family honor.        

Referring to Ms. Ghazanfar&rsquo;s statistics, Manizha Naderi, whose organization Women for Afghan Women runs four shelters, said, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a total lie.&rdquo; Her shelter in Kabul, with a population of 40 on a given day, takes care of 350 women in a year, at a total cost of $100,000, she said. &ldquo;There is no shelter in Afghanistan with a million dollar budget.&rdquo;        

Many women&rsquo;s rights advocates have been alarmed by the government&rsquo;s proposals. &ldquo;What we&rsquo;ve heard from our donors is they will not fund the government to run shelters,&rdquo; Ms. Naderi said. &ldquo;No shelters are going to accept that.&rdquo; Her group is supported by private donations from Americans and by foreign aid grants from Finland, Sweden, the European Union and the United States.        

Ms. Ghazanfar suggested that she was unconcerned about the possibility that international financing for the shelters would dry up. &ldquo;The international community gives $11 million and we can work with much less of a budget,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;If they are not ready to give us this money, only one million will take care of this. This budget we can find from anywhere.&rdquo;        

A statement issued by the United Nations recently recommended that the government consider revisions to the new regulations, as proposed by a legal review commission including human rights advocates as well as government officials.        

&ldquo;The U.N. recognizes that government monitoring and oversight of these centers is needed,&rdquo; the statement said. &ldquo;At the same time, civil society organizations should continue to operate women protection centers/shelters independently.&rdquo;        

Ms. Ghazanfar said government control of the shelters reflected the growing maturity of the Afghan government and the increased professionalism of the police, and was part of the broader transition process from dependency on foreign agencies.        

Many women&rsquo;s advocates, however, complain that shelters are needed because women cannot trust the police to act on their behalf. Many women, even very prominent ones, say that in many places women will not go into a police station without a male protector for fear of being abused by the police.        

Ms. Ghazanfar &ldquo;is being used by the Afghan government to further their policy of trying to negotiate with the Taliban,&rdquo; Ms. Naderi said. &ldquo;Targeting women&rsquo;s shelters is the first step, and they&rsquo;ll keep at it until all rights for women are taken away and the Taliban can come back in.&rdquo;        

The acting women&rsquo;s minister, who has held the job for more than a year but never was confirmed by Parliament, said the new regulations came about as the result of the still-secret report of a presidential commission that spent a year studying the shelters.        

&ldquo;There are a series of violations we can see,&rdquo; she said. Asked for details, she listed some. &ldquo;Lack of order and discipline, and chaos in some of them. Lack of activities. Shifting women from one province to another. Not following their court cases responsibly. Lack of health facilities. Women kept two weeks when one week was enough. Failure to report problems. Lack of proper reports. Corruption in spending their budgets.&rdquo;        

&ldquo;There was $10 million in U.N.D.P. funds for women,&rdquo; she said, referring to the United Nations Development Program. &ldquo;How was it spent? No one knows.&rdquo;        

&ldquo;We would be happy to sit down with the minister at any time to fully explain how funds have been spent and look forward to being able to do this as soon as possible,&rdquo; said the United Nations spokesman in Kabul, Dan McNorton. &ldquo;The United Nations works closely with the Ministry of Women&rsquo;s Affairs and other ministries on these critical issues to ensure that Afghan women receive the protection they deserve.&rdquo;
