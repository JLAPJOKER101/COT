An Israeli soldier was killed in a clash on the Gaza border on Friday by a mortar shell fired by his own forces, an Israeli Army spokesman said, speaking anonymously according to military regulation. Four other soldiers were wounded by the mortar. The episode occurred after Israeli forces spotted a group of Palestinians trying to plant an explosive device at the border, the army said.
