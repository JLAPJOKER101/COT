Reports are trickling into to our tipline that Ooma, a popular VOIP service, is currently experiencing major network issues. Currently, Oomas phone service seems offline nationwide, and their website and support forums are working sporadically if at all. Some users (mostly in California) are reporting that their service is returning, but right now, it would appear that a majority of subscribers are unable to make or receive phone calls. Another outage similar in scale to this one occurred in 2009, with service remaining offline for nearly 6 hours. Concerned customers who attempted to reach out to Oomas main office were treated to a canned message stating that the office was closed, and the voice mailbox was soon filled. Rumors have begun to swirl among affected customers on the DSL Reports forums that Ooma is in the process of shutting down, but we can confirm that this is not that case.A few calls to the Ooma customer service line yielded a brief conversation with a rep, who states that they are aware of the problem, and that service would we be restored within two hours. Apparently, once service is restored, the Ooma hub in customers homes will begin to work again without any input from the user. Affected customers should keep their eyes peeled for the tell-tale blue light on their hubs. This timetable will likely be little comfort to those affected, some of whom use Ooma as their business phone service. Updates are coming at a blistering pace, so all you Ooma users should stay tuned.UPDATE #1: The Ooma Status Twitter account is acknowledging the issue, no update on ETA. Ooma website is still down.Sporadic failures on our Internet connectivity is affecting many customers. We are working to resolve the issue ASAP. ooma support (@ooma_status) August 17, 2011UPDATE #2: Word on Oomas Facebook page and on DSLReports is that service is slowly coming back online. Keep looking for that blue light on the hub.
