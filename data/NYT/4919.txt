A suicide bomber on a motorbike blew himself up outside a district police headquarters in a generally peaceful area of northern Afghanistan near the Turkmenistan border, killing four people. The attack was in the Aqcha District of Jowzjan Province, known for its carpet weavers. In a separate attack in Jowzjan Province, five border police officers were killed by a roadside bomb. Mullah Khudai Nazar Qumsayee, the chief of the provincial elders&rsquo; council, accused the government of neglect. &ldquo;The Taliban are now in the stage of infiltration in Jowzjan,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and are prodding mullahs to preach in their favor.&rdquo;
