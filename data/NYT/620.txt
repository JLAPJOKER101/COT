The  former telecommunications minister whose handling of the sale of mobile  telephone spectrum licenses may have cost the government as much as $39  billion in revenue has been arrested, officials said. A government  report released last year accused the former minister, Andimuthu Raja, of selling the airwaves at giveaway prices to favored companies. The ensuing scandal shook what had been India&rsquo;s most stable government in decades and raised questions about whether the nation&rsquo;s rapid growth could be at risk because of rampant corruption. Mr. Raja and several associates were arrested on Wednesday.
