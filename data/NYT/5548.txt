ISLAMABAD, Pakistan &mdash; A potential military and diplomatic crisis was averted Sunday after an Indian Army helicopter that had strayed into Pakistan&rsquo;s airspace and was forced to land by its military was allowed to return home, according to Pakistani officials.        

The Indian Cheetah helicopter had violated the airspace in the disputed Kashmir region about 1 p.m. on Sunday and was forced by air force fighters to land in the Skardu region of northern Pakistan, a military spokesman said. Four Indian Army officers &mdash; two pilots, a technician and a lieutenant colonel &mdash; were detained for several hours.        

Pakistan and India are bitter rivals, both armed with nuclear weapons, who have fought three wars and share a disputed border. Each side maintains a heavy military presence along the Line of Control, which divides Kashmir.        

After an investigation on Sunday, Pakistani military officials agreed with the Indian government&rsquo;s assertion that bad weather had caused the helicopter to fly into Pakistan&rsquo;s airspace.        

&ldquo;The airspace violation was not intentional,&rdquo; said a Pakistani Army official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.        

In recent months, both countries have taken steps toward repairing their relationship. It had worsened after the 2008 terrorist attack in Mumbai, which was carried out by Pakistan-based militants.
