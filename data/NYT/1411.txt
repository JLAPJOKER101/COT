RAS AJDIR BORDER CROSSING, Tunisia &mdash; There is no civil war in Libya, they say, no bombs, no fighting, no fear.        

&ldquo;There are no revolutionaries,&rdquo; said Fouzi Ali Khalefa Lagerebi, 22, a trim, newly minted Libyan policeman. &ldquo;I recommend you watch the national Libyan channel. Everyone is with Qaddafi.&rdquo;        

Such is one of the surreal mantras of the Libyans who cross in and out of Tunisia every day at this dusty, dilapidated border station. They enter alongside the thousands of migrant workers who continue to flee the violence the Libyans often deny. &ldquo;Mia, mia!&rdquo; many Libyans say &mdash; &ldquo;Everything is fine!&rdquo; &mdash; on their way to the nearby towns where they sell Libyan clothes and gasoline, and buy the food and medicine they cannot find on their side of the border.        

Most refuse to speak to reporters, peeling off in battered Mercedes sedans and low-slung Toyota Hiluxes. Those who are willing to describe the situation in western Libya typically tell of a state of total calm, or else, like Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, the Libyan leader, assert that what little violence is occurring is carried out by Al Qaeda fighters and drugged youths. There are rumors of spies recording license plate numbers, and reports of detention of Libyans who stop to speak to journalists.        

Some of the muddled accounts are testament, experts suggest, to the climate of fear that still pervades the west of Colonel Qaddafi&rsquo;s Libya, where rebels and loyalist forces continue to battle for control. Other accounts seem to reflect a wholesale denial of reality, a remarkable willingness to take Colonel Qaddafi at his every hyperbolic word, or at least a decided taste for conspiracy narratives.        

Mr. Lagerebi had come from the small northwestern city of Zaltan to fill prescriptions for his family. A strip of green cotton hung from the rearview mirror of his car, a symbol of his support for the Qaddafi government.        

&ldquo;He is the guide of the revolution, a true leader,&rdquo; Mr. Lagerebi said, and &ldquo;he subsidizes everything.&rdquo;        

Foreign reporters have concocted lies about violence in cities across Libya, he said, though he could not suggest why. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing happening,&rdquo; he insisted. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re faking it.&rdquo;        

&ldquo;That is not my Libya,&rdquo; he said.        

The 230,000 migrant workers who have left Libya since mid-February did so at the behest of the Libyan people, Mr. Lagerebi went on. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want them here anymore,&rdquo; he explained, saying they brought sickness and filth into the country.        

Many appear less certain than Mr. Lagerebi of the narrative they ought to offer to outsiders. Hussein Aead Alaffe, 36, had come to Tunisia from the embattled city of Zawiyah to escape the &ldquo;stress&rdquo; of the fighting there, he said.        

&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t go outside at all; I&rsquo;m scared of the rebels,&rdquo; he said, explaining that the fighters were &ldquo;people taking drugs, and Al Qaeda, or something else.&rdquo;        

&ldquo;In Zawiyah,&rdquo; said Mr. Alaffe, wearing a worn leather jacket and seated behind the wheel of a new black Mazda S.U.V., &ldquo;if you raise the green flag of Muammar el-Qaddafi, the rebels will shoot you.&rdquo;        

Moments earlier, though, he was describing the calm that he said reigned in the city. He had neither seen nor heard small-arms or artillery fire, he said, despite widespread reports of heavy shelling and fighting in the streets before loyalist forces took control in recent days. What little fighting there was had been confined to the city center, he said, and was wildly exaggerated by the news media.        

&ldquo;Praise be to God, everything in Zawiyah is quite good,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s odd what I see on television.&rdquo;        

Mr. Alaffe drove off as a dozen Tunisian men crowded the driver&rsquo;s side window of his car, shouting, &ldquo;You are telling lies!&rdquo;        

A lanky young man from Zuwarah said Libyans seen speaking with journalists were being detained by the police. &ldquo;Everything there is possible,&rdquo; said the man, 21, sweating nervously in a Mercedes jalopy.        

His heart seemed to race beneath a thin sweater. He declined to give his name, fearing repercussions.        

There has long been an ingrained culture of fearful obedience and paranoia in Libya, as under other similar governments, experts and former residents say.

&ldquo;Libyans are accustomed to not speaking about Qaddafi,&rdquo; said Luis Martinez, the director of the Center for Research on Africa and the Mediterranean, in Rabat, Morocco. After 42 years under Colonel Qaddafi&rsquo;s rule, he said, &ldquo;They have assimilated the notion that one doesn&rsquo;t speak about all of this.&rdquo;        

He judged Libyan concerns about spies unsurprising, and perhaps well founded. &ldquo;The power of this regime has been in making people believe it is everywhere,&rdquo; Mr. Martinez said, adding that the secret police had long been a widely felt presence in Libya and that critics of the government had long been known to &ldquo;disappear.&rdquo;        

&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t have the culture of expressing themselves,&rdquo; said Mounia Kaddour, 23, a Tunisian student who lived with her family in Zawiyah until she was 20. Libyans are &ldquo;crazy&rdquo; with fear and paranoia, she said, though she acknowledged that their concerns were probably legitimate. Asked what became of Libyans who spoke against the government, she grimly drew her thumb across her neck.        

Lazhar Taieb, 45, a craggy Tunisian selling cigarettes and chewing gum from a wooden box on the pavement of this border station, claimed to know several Tunisians paid by Colonel Qaddafi&rsquo;s government to spy on Libyans here.        

&ldquo;Tunisia is full of Qaddafi&rsquo;s spies,&rdquo; he exclaimed. He said he understood the hesitance of many Libyans here to speak of the violence in Libya.        

&ldquo;They know the trouble that would be coming for them in Libya,&rdquo; he said, but added, &ldquo;When they feel the regime is going to fall, then you&rsquo;ll begin to hear many stories.&rdquo;        

A small number of people have described the fighting in Libya, with caution.        

Behind the lonely cafe and general store at the border crossing, one Libyan man dressed in black spoke in hushed tones as he siphoned Libyan gasoline out of a black late-model Chevrolet into plastic canisters for sale in Tunisia, at a 1,000 percent markup.        

&ldquo;There are Libyans here who are listening,&rdquo; explained the man, 28, from Zawiyah. &ldquo;This is normal, it&rsquo;s Qaddafi&rsquo;s regime.&rdquo; He repeatedly asked a visitor to hide a notebook, burying his chin inside a raised jacket collar, his eyes following passing Libyan cars and trucks. He said Libyan customs officials kept a list of citizens not to be permitted out of the country.        

Libyans &ldquo;want to speak out,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but they can&rsquo;t.&rdquo; He declined to give his name. &ldquo;If I were in Benghazi, I would,&rdquo; he said, smiling, referring to the rebel stronghold in eastern Libya.        

How he could be sure a reporter was not a spy for Colonel Qaddafi&rsquo;s government?        

&ldquo;That,&rdquo; he replied, laughing, &ldquo;I leave in God&rsquo;s hands.&rdquo;        

And why had he chosen to speak? He threw up his hands and grinned.        

&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t spoken,&rdquo; he said.
