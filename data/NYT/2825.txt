The United States imposed sanctions on Venezuela&rsquo;s national oil company, Petr&oacute;leos de Venezuela, for its deliveries of two shipments of fuel valued at $50 million to Iran. The sanctions do not directly affect the operations of Citgo, the company&rsquo;s American subsidiary, or prohibit Venezuelan oil exports to the United States. But they prevent Petr&oacute;leos de Venezuela from competing for United States government contracts, obtaining export licenses or receiving financing from the Export-Import Bank. The State Department also imposed sanctions on six smaller oil and shipping companies, based in the United Arab Emirates, Singapore, Israel, Britain and Monaco, for dealings with Iran.
