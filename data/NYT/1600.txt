Gunfire rocked Ouagadougou, the capital, for more than three hours overnight on Wednesday in what an army source said was a protest by soldiers against arrests of their colleagues. The shooting came from two military camps, one in Ouagadougou and one on its outskirts. Defense Minister Yero Boly called for calm but did not give an explanation for the episode, which he said had wounded about a dozen people. A source at army headquarters said soldiers had been angered by the arrests and detentions of five colleagues found guilty of attacking a civilian when an argument went out of control.
