A federal grand jury in Brooklyn indicted a house painter in Edmonton, Alberta, on Friday for aiding in a 2009 suicide bombing that killed five American soldiers in Iraq. In addition to five murder charges, the suspect, Sayfildin Tahir Sharif, was charged with conspiring to kill Americans abroad and providing material support to a terrorist conspiracy. Mr. Tahir Sharif, 39, who also goes by other names, has been jailed since his arrest in Edmonton in late January. His lawyer, Bob Aloneissi, said Mr. Tahir Sharif denied the charges, adding that officials seem to have exaggerated the impact of his client&rsquo;s remarks about the war in Iraq. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard to understand how he had a hand in murder in Iraq when he was here in Edmonton,&rdquo; Mr. Aloneissi said. An extradition hearing is scheduled for next month.
