The prime minister, Essam Sharaf, said Monday that he would reshuffle the cabinet within a week and would try to hold public trials of former government officials and police officers accused of killing protesters during the revolution. The announcement, broadcast on state television, was a bid to appease thousands of people who have taken to the streets recently protesting what they say is the slow pace of reform by Egypt&rsquo;s ruling military council. Also on Monday, military officials said that four American citizens were detained in Suez by local citizens and handed over to the military authorities.
