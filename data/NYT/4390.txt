The Borno State police said three officers and a civilian were shot to death at a residence in northeastern Nigeria by suspected members of a radical Muslim sect. The police commissioner, Simeone Midenda, said the victims were watching television when gunmen burst into the room and shot them. Mr. Midenda blamed the attack on a group known locally as Boko Haram, which is responsible for a rash of killings aimed at security officers, local leaders and clerics over the last year. Boko Haram seeks the strict implementation of Shariah law in northern Nigeria.
