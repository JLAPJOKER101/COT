LIANGJIAHE, China &mdash; The cave is dim and narrow and musty. A platform bed covered with a reed mat sits by the door. A green canvas satchel and a lantern hang from two rusty nails on a wall &mdash; possessions supposedly left behind by a lanky teenage boy from Beijing sent here four decades ago to do hard labor.        

&ldquo;He liked reading books,&rdquo; said L&uuml;  Nengzhong, 80, a farmer who housed the boy, Xi Jinping, for three years. &ldquo;They were thick books, but I don&rsquo;t know what they were about. He read until he fell asleep.&rdquo;        

These days, Mr. Xi&rsquo;s reading materials veer more toward speeches and government planning documents &mdash; the vice president of China, age 57, he is expected to take over from Hu Jintao next year as the nation&rsquo;s top leader. His official biography is being airbrushed. Village officials here have received orders to bar journalists from sniffing around Mr. Xi&rsquo;s old home.        

Liangjiahe is the foundation of a by-the-bootstraps creation myth that Mr. Xi has long cultivated. In an essay for a 2003 book Mr. Xi said his seven years here led to a life transformation. Using standard Marxist-Leninist-Maoist language, he wrote about learning to serve the people.        

We &ldquo;mustn&rsquo;t stand high above the masses nor consider the masses as our fish and meat,&rdquo; he said. He went on: &ldquo;The hard life of the grass roots can cultivate one&rsquo;s will. With that kind of experience, whatever difficulties I would encounter in the future, I am fully charged with courage to take on any challenge, to believe in the impossible and to conquer obstacles without panic.&rdquo;        

The village is in a narrow valley about 70 miles from Yan&rsquo;an, the city in the northern province of Shaanxi that served as the Communist Party&rsquo;s revolutionary base for 12 years during the Chinese civil war. Mr. Xi&rsquo;s father, Xi Zhongxun, a native of Shaanxi, helped build the base and became a venerated party leader. He was purged during the Cultural Revolution, and his son was sent here from Beijing at age 15 to toil in a work brigade.        

The village comprises  100 households, twice as big as in Mr. Xi&rsquo;s day. The people&rsquo;s homes are caves built into the dry hillsides. The elders farm fields of corn, pumpkins and potatoes; younger people have left for cities seeking work. A fine yellow silt covers the landscape, the signature feature of the Loess Plateau. Mr. Xi once wrote that he was &ldquo;a son of the yellow earth.&rdquo; Donkey carts plod down the road. Women shuffle home with bundles of wood lashed to their backs.        

The son of a revolutionary hero, Mr. Xi parachuted in from a life of aristocracy in Beijing. He was one of about a dozen youths sent to the area from the capital.        

&ldquo;He was very different from us,&rdquo; said Mr. L&uuml;, now a stooped man in a blue Mao suit and black-rimmed glasses. &ldquo;His look was different, and his speech was different. We couldn&rsquo;t understand his Beijing accent, and he couldn&rsquo;t understand us at first.&rdquo;        

Farming was not in Mr. Xi&rsquo;s blood. Even after one year here, he struggled to balance two buckets of water on a bamboo pole across his shoulders, Mr. L&uuml; said. &ldquo;He slid down hills on his butt instead of walking down them,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;He was very careful, very cautious.&rdquo;        

&ldquo;He said to me: &lsquo;You Shaanxi people are really something. You can spot stones in the fields that I can&rsquo;t,&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; Mr. L&uuml; said. &ldquo;And I said, &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t look for the stones, you feel for them.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;        

Many of the other youths sent here came from military families, and Mr. Xi befriended them. But most joined the army after only half a year. &ldquo;I felt very lonely,&rdquo; Mr. Xi wrote. &ldquo;But after I got used to the local life, especially after I lost myself in the local people, I felt happiness in life.&rdquo;        

Mr. Xi moved among several cave homes. During his three years in Mr. L&uuml;&rsquo;s care, Mr. Xi became close to Mr. L&uuml;&rsquo;s son, L&uuml; Housheng. Later, after Mr. Xi became governor of Fujian Province, he sent money to the younger L&uuml; to help with a leg operation; the son flew to Fujian for the procedure. On Mr. L&uuml;&rsquo;s wall is a photo of his wiry son standing next to Mr. Xi. &ldquo;He was like one of the family,&rdquo; Mr. L&uuml; said. &ldquo;We all lived together. When there was something the matter, he would come talk to me.&rdquo;
