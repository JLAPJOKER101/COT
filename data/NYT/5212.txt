At least 224 people have died in flooding in Thailand since mid-July, and water has inundated the 400-year-old Chai Wattanaram temple in the ancient city of Ayutthaya, a World Heritage Site, officials said Tuesday. The temple is by the Chao Phraya river, which flows down to the capital, Bangkok, about 65 miles to the south.        

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Thailand has been hit by major flooding caused by a tropical storm followed by seasonal monsoon rains. In neighboring Cambodia, 164 people have been reported killed in floods since Aug. 13.
