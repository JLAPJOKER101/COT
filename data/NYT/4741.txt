Six people were shot dead by a soldier as families scrambled for food aid in the capital on Thursday, witnesses said. Families had stood in line for hours at a food aid distribution center in Mogadishu before finally rushing guards and carrying off food, a witness said. He said the guards tried to beat them back with rifle butts but then opened fire. A district official said he could only confirm one death.
