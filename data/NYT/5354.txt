WASHINGTON -- The official military investigation into a helicopter shoot-down that caused the largest loss of American life during a single day of the war in Afghanistan has found no wrongful actions by personnel involved in the mission, nor were there equipment failures.        

The inquiry examined how the mission was planned, how it was executed, how the air crew was trained and even how the commandos were loaded on the helicopter, and found that all were adequate and not responsible for what happened.        

The inquiry concluded that &ldquo;this mission, and the tactics and resources employed in its execution, were consistent with previous U.S. Special Operations missions.&rdquo; The review also ruled that &ldquo;the strike forces selected to execute the mission were appropriate.&rdquo;        

The Aug. 6 crash was blamed on a rocket-propelled grenade fired by a Taliban fighter. All 38 people on board were killed: 17 members of the elite Navy Seals, 5 members of a Naval Special Warfare unit that supports the Seals team, 3 members of an Air Force Special Operations unit, 5 members of an Army helicopter crew, 7 Afghan commandos and a civilian Afghan interpreter.        

The findings had been predicted by a variety of officials involved in Special Operations missions, although retired military personnel - and family members of those who perished - were especially concerned by why so many commandos were aboard a single helicopter.        

The inquiry found that the decision to load all of the personnel onto one helicopter was &ldquo;to mitigate risk by minimizing aircraft exposure to ground fire and to mass the assault force.&rdquo; This, the inquiry found, &ldquo;was tactically sound.&rdquo;        

The insurgents were not awaiting the arrival of the helicopter because of some prior knowledge of the landing site, and the inquiry dismissed suggestions that it was &ldquo;a baited ambush.&rdquo;        

Instead, the insurgents were in a position to fire with such lethality on the Chinook because they were &ldquo;at a heightened state of alert&rdquo; owing to several hours of air operations in the Tangi Valley of Wardak Province.        

Because of that, a set of specific criticisms were raised: the Special Operations task force commander &ldquo;did not reallocate the intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance aircraft to ensure surveillance coverage&rdquo; for the ongoing assault. And the report called for better planning of aircraft overhead during such missions &ldquo;to minimize possible early warning to the enemy of imminent ground operations.&rdquo;        

Officials said the report on the inquiry was released after its findings were discussed with family members of the military personnel killed in the mission.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
