Tunisian security forces used tear gas and truncheons on Monday to disperse a crowd of protesters in the capital demanding that the government step down for failing to prosecute supporters of the ousted president, Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali. Thousands of people also gathered for protests in towns and cities elsewhere, in the biggest show of popular anger in months in Tunisia, a North African country whose revolution at the start of this year inspired the so-called Arab Spring uprisings. &ldquo;We need a new revolution,&rdquo; said one protester, Mounir Troudi. &ldquo;Nothing has changed.&rdquo; Mr. Ben Ali has been tried and found guilty in absentia on charges including theft and corruption, receiving sentences of up to 35 years. However, many Tunisians contrast that with Egypt, where former President Hosni Mubarak and his sons have been put on public trial.
