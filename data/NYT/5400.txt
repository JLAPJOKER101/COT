A court has allowed the captured American fugitive George Wright to leave jail and stay at his home in Portugal while he fights extradition to the United States, his lawyer said Friday. A judge released Mr. Wright from custody on the condition that he stay at his home near Lisbon and wear an electronic tag that monitors his movements, said his lawyer, Manuel Lu&iacute;s Ferreira. Mr. Wright spent seven years in a United States prison for a 1962 killing in New Jersey before escaping in 1970, and he was on the run for 41 years until his arrest in Portugal almost three weeks ago.
