Assailants attacked more than 20 tankers in Pakistan on Thursday that were carrying fuel for American and NATO troops in Afghanistan. Several hundred trucks have been stranded at poorly guarded terminals around Pakistan since the country closed the border last month to protest coalition airstrikes that killed 24 of its soldiers. The police said rockets were fired at a terminal for the tankers near the southwestern city of Quetta, setting fire to at least 23 tankers, right. There were no immediate reports of casualties. Until the border closing, about 40 percent of nonlethal supplies for foreign troops in Afghanistan crossed through Pakistan.
