After 128 days, 7 Beta releases, and 1 gold master, its finally arrived. iOS 5 has just been released to everyone (or at least, everyone with a compatible iOS device).For those who hadnt finagled their way into the developer Betas: 1) youre a more patient human than I could ever hope to be, and 2) youre in for a treat. This is the biggest update iOS has seen since the addition of the App Store, and its jam-packed full of good stuff.The iOS 5 update is compatible with the iPhone 3GS, iPhone 4 (GSM and CDMA), iPod touch 3rd/4th generation, and the iPad/iPad 2. Itll also come preloaded on the 4S, of course, when that device launches later this week.Its been a while since iOS 5 was announced to the world, so heres a quick recap of some of the biggest features:Downloading the update is pretty simple: just plug in, pop into iTunes, tap on your devices name in the left-hand navigation, and click the Update button found on the page that pops up. If youre not seeing the update, give it a few minutes â€” the servers are getting hammered pretty hard right now.
