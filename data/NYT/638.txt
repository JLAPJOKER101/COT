A court on Thursday extended by at least eight days the detention of an American official suspected in the shooting deaths of two Pakistanis as the police pursued possible murder charges. The United States says the American, identified by Pakistanis as Raymond Allen Davis, has diplomatic immunity and should be released immediately. He has said he acted in self-defense last week when he shot two armed men who were intent on robbing him at gunpoint.
