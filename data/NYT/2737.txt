A company controlled by the dissident artist Ai Weiwei evaded a &ldquo;huge amount&rdquo; of taxes and intentionally destroyed financial documents, Xinhua, the government&rsquo;s official news agency, reported Friday. Xinhua, quoting the police, said that the authorities were focusing on Beijing Fake Cultural Development Ltd. The artist&rsquo;s sister, Gao Ge, told Reuters that Mr. Ai is neither the company&rsquo;s legal representative nor its chief executive. &ldquo;So even if the company is accused of these crimes, Ai Weiwei should not be detained,&rdquo; she said. Mr. Ai has been detained at an undisclosed location since April 3.
