Election observers in southern Sudan said on Monday that the region&rsquo;s referendum on independence last week was transparent and credible and that southern independence was likely. &ldquo;The referendum process to date is broadly consistent with international standards for democratic elections,&rdquo; said the Carter Center of Atlanta, based on election monitoring. On Sunday, early polling results released in the capital, Juba, showed voters choosing independence from the north by an average margin of over 95 percent, with a 95 percent voter turnout. Southern independence would take effect July 9.
