The police force in the port city of Veracruz was dissolved on Wednesday, and Mexican officials sent the navy in to patrol. The Veracruz State government said the decision was part of an effort to root out police corruption and start over in the state&rsquo;s largest city. A state spokeswoman, Gina Dominguez, said 800 police officers and 300 administrative employees were laid off. She told reporters that the former officers could apply for jobs in a state police force but would have to meet stricter standards. Thirty-five bodies were dumped in Veracruz in one of the worst gang attacks of Mexico&rsquo;s drug war. The Mexican Army has taken over police operations several times, notably in the border city of Ciudad Ju&aacute;rez. But Veracruz is the first state to disband a large police department and use marines for law enforcement.
