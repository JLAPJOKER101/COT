The Gillmor Gang — Robert Scoble, John Borthwick, John Taschek, Kevin Marks, and Steve Gillmor — gears up for a rough and tumble Social Shakedown. Facebook, Path (?), Gmail filters, News.me, Media Redefined — were swimming in signal without a paddle. But some of us (@scobleizer) are happy to see the big get personal and the little get better.Whether you live to serve the social beast, or prefer to stand back and see how big this is going to get, it really doesnt matter whether this is early innings as @jtaschek and @borthwick suggest or reaching an @mention moment as @stevegillmor expects. The culture of business and the politics of the personal have swapped personalities, and work and play are meeting up in the middle.@stevegillmor, @borthwick, @scoblizer, @kevinmarks, @jtaschekProduced and directed by Tina Chase Gillmor. recorded live Friday, December 2, 2011.
