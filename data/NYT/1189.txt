Queen Elizabeth is to make a state visit to the Irish Republic this year, the first by a British monarch in 100 years and the only one since Ireland broke from Britain to become an independent country. The visit, which will likely take place in early summer, is of huge symbolic importance and illustrates how far relations between Britain and Ireland have come since the struggles over independence and the worst days of the Troubles between the nationalists and unionists in Northern Ireland. Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, criticized the trip as &ldquo;premature&rdquo; but said that he respected the Irish president&rsquo;s right to invite the queen to come.
