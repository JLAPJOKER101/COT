We took a break from the Android round-up in December because, well, to be honest I was on vacation. But January gave us a few extra smartphones and the holidays are over, so were back. What weve got for you today leans into more expensive turf, and unfortunately, our favorite Android devices for the past two months are also exclusively at Verizon, so Big Red subscribers should pay attention. Without further ado, these are our favorite December/January releases of the Android persuasion: The Samsung Galaxy Nexus, the LG Spectrum, and the Motorola Droid RAZR Maxx. Enjoy!Features:Pros:Cons:If youre looking for Android, the Galaxy Nexus is where youll find it. Ice Cream Sandwich is a joy compared to Gingerbread, and this coming from someone who is quite hard on Android. Of course, the screen on this bad boy is amazing, but as MG points out in his review, sometimes the phone is just too big to perform one-handed actions. We also expected image quality to be better out of that 5-megapixel rear camera, but it simply cant compete with the iPhones 8-megapixel shooter. (And no, Im not saying that based on megapixels Image quality is simply better with the 4S.) But that doesnt really matter  an Android fan is an Android fan, and this is as good as Android gets.
