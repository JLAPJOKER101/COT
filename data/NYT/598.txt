A Pakistani court ordered the government on Tuesday not to release an American official arrested in the shooting deaths of two Pakistanis despite American insistence that he had diplomatic immunity. Chief Justice Ijaz Chaudhry of the Lahore High Court also told the government to place the American, Raymond A. Davis, on the &ldquo;exit control list&rdquo; so that he could not leave the country. The American Embassy in Islamabad has argued that Mr. Davis acted in self-defense when he shot the two men in Lahore on Thursday. He has said the men were trying to rob him at gunpoint. The ruling came after a petition from a local lawyer who feared Mr. Davis would be released as a result of American pressure.
