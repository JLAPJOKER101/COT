Eight Chinese-born pro-democracy advocates filed suit in Federal District Court in Manhattan on Wednesday against one of China&rsquo;s largest Internet companies, Baidu, accusing it of colluding with the government in censoring Web search results. The suit charges that there is a &ldquo;conspiracy&rdquo; between Baidu and the government to censor &ldquo;any political speech that is pro-democracy.&rdquo; Jiang Yu, a Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, said Thursday that China guaranteed freedom of speech online and that American courts had no jurisdiction in the country, the news agency Xinhua reported.
