Iraqi authorities have arrested a high-ranking police official in connection with the purchase of a British-made bomb detector that the British government says does not work, officials said Thursday. Iraq spent about $122 million on the devices, which are widely used by police and soldiers at security checkpoints and were meant to be a key defense against insurgents. Hundreds of people have been killed in bombings in recent years after militants were able to get trucks, buses and cars packed with explosives through Baghdad&rsquo;s numerous checkpoints. The government began investigations after reports that the ADE 651 bomb detection devices purchased from a British-based company were practically useless. Maj. Gen. Jihad al-Jabiri, the commander of the bomb squad, was arrested five days ago, officials said.
