Brazil&rsquo;s Supreme Court ruled Thursday night that civil unions between same-sex couples must be allowed in the nation, which has more Roman Catholics than any other. In a 10-0 vote, with one abstention, the justices said gay couples deserve the same legal rights as heterosexual pairs when it comes to alimony, retirement benefits of a partner who dies and inheritances, among other issues. The ruling, however, stopped short of legalizing gay marriage.
