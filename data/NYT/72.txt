A Zambian judge has issued arrest warrants for two Chinese coal mine managers after the defendants failed to appear in court on accusations of shooting at striking workers. The managers, Xiao Lishan, 48, and Wu Jiuhua, 46, have been charged with several counts of attempted murder. About a dozen miners were wounded in the shooting on Oct. 15. The two managers were released on bail in October amid public fears that the pair might return to China instead of facing trial. The Chinese Embassy in Lusaka refused to comment on Tuesday on why the coal mine managers had not shown up in court.
