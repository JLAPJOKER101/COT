If your company doesnt have a Facebook Timeline app yet, youre late to the party. 3,000 Timeline apps have spawned since Facebook launched the platform 3 months ago, and today Foursquare, VEVO, The Onion, Fandango, BandPage, and more big companies are unveiling theirs to cash in on the free virality. Pinterest and others have already seen wild growth from the platforms ability to automatically publish to the Facebook Ticker, news feed, and Timeline when users take action.These new launches, and especially Nikes, are likely to convince more brands and startups that Timeline app development is worth the investment. That means soon there will be even more apps feeding user behaviors into Facebooks content feeds and ad targeting engine.The Onion definitely wins for most the ridiculous integration Ive ever seen Facebook promote. Its website now explains Shove The Onion down your friends throats. Log in to Facebook now to see what your so-called friends are reading and watching, and to let them see every fucking thing youre reading and watching. Kudos to Facebook for being chill enough to approve this.Facebook notes that Pinterest has seen its Facebook user base grow 60% since it launched its Timeline app in January when Facebook opened the platform to all developers. Meanwhile Goodreads has boosted daily traffic by 77% and Pose has had 5X growth of web and mobile signups. Facebook has previously announced big growth stats for news readers and music apps.Todays announcement could be the tipping point where the rest of the worlds companies realize, Hey, we can get buckets of free traffic and exposure through a Timeline app. Facebook sure hopes so. Since Open Graph Timeline apps contribute user behavior data in a structured way, it can use that data to let advertisers target them based on where they check in, whether they work out, or what movies theyve actually seen  not just Liked.Heres what Facebook says the new apps do (Ive deleted the unnecessary pep talk and added some growth stats Ive pulled from the companies):Foursquare: Foursquare uses many of the new features announced last week to bring its location app to Timeline.
