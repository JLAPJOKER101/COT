Arda Kara and Alexander Blessing are from two pretty different places  Turkey and Germany, respectively  but as students pursuing masters degrees in computer science at Stanford, they both faced very similar problems when it came to communicating with their family and old friends. Because of the massive time zone differences between California and Europe, it was pretty much impossible to schedule a time to talk daily on the phone or via Skype. Texts and emails were a bit too cold. Video messages through mobile apps such asSocialCam and Viddy were just a bit too high-maintenance  who wants to have to shave before sending a quick Hi to mom and dad?So they teamed up to build VoiceGem, a simple app for the web and the iPhone that lets you send and receive personal voice messages. VoiceGem, which is part of the current Summer 2012 class at Silicon Valley startup incubator Y Combinator, is launching in public beta today. Some of the most key things about VoiceGem are negatives, things it *doesnt* require from users: It doesnt cost any money. It doesnt require special software. It doesnt have you send or open any kind of attachment. It doesnt require a special international calling plan or card  or even a phone number at all. It doesnt need a high-quality microphone system. The initial use case was for communicating with family of all ages, Kara and Blessing tell me, so the aim was to make it as simple as possible.A screenshot of a VoiceGem I received from co-founder Arda Kara (click to enlarge)
