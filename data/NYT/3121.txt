China has rejected pressure from a United Nations human rights panel to provide information on &ldquo;the fate and whereabouts&rdquo; of more than 300 Tibetan monks who have been missing since April, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said Thursday. The spokesman, Hong Lei, said local authorities were &ldquo;conducting legal education&rdquo; for the monks to &ldquo;maintain religious order.&rdquo; He said there had been &ldquo;no such thing as enforced disappearance&rdquo; of the monks from the Kirti monastery in Sichuan Province.
