NAIROBI, Kenya (Reuters) &mdash; A Kenyan court on Monday ordered the government to arrest President Omar al-Bashir of Sudan, who is wanted by the International Criminal Court on genocide charges, should he ever return to Kenya.        

The ruling prompted Sudan to order the expulsion of Kenya&rsquo;s ambassador and summon its own envoy from Nairobi.        

Kenya was heavily criticized by the International Criminal Court and foreign governments for failing to arrest Mr. Bashir when he attended a ceremony in Kenya last year.        

The African Union has told its members not to enforce the arrest warrant for Mr. Bashir, which is linked to his government&rsquo;s crackdown on rebels in the Darfur region, saying the court was singling out African leaders. However, as a signatory to the court, Kenya is obliged to cooperate with it.        

The Kenyan court ordered Mr. Bashir&rsquo;s arrest in response to a suit against the attorney general and the internal security minister seeking a new arrest warrant for Mr. Bashir. Judge Nicholas Ombija ordered that Mr. Bashir should be apprehended &ldquo;should he set foot in Kenya in future.&rdquo;        

In response, Sudan gave Kenya&rsquo;s ambassador in Khartoum 72 hours to leave the country and summoned its ambassador from Nairobi, according to Sudan&rsquo;s Foreign Ministry spokesman, El-Obeid Morawah.
