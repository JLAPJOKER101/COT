Twenty-six bodies were found inside three abandoned vehicles on a busy road in the heart of Guadajalara, Mexico&rsquo;s second-largest city, state officials said Thursday. Many victims had &ldquo;Milenio Zetas&rdquo; written on their chests. A message was left in one of the vans clarifying that this is a battle between cartels and not with ordinary citizens. It also referred to the governments of Jalisco, where Guadalajara is located, and Sinaloa, where 16 people were found charred on Wednesday.
