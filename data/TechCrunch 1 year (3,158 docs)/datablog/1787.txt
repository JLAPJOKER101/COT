Exercise gadgetry seems to be all the rage this season, with products like the Jawbone UP and MotoACTV entering the marketplace. Nike of all companies will certainly not be left behind, and has today announced a new wristband called the FuelBand. Not unlike its competitors, the FuelBand measures time, steps and calories during your fitness routine. Its incredibly similar to the Jawbone UP, as its a fitness tracking wrist band. The most poignant difference is that Nikes FuelBand measures something called NikeFuel  a measurement of your wrist movement. Nike claims that the more you move, the more NikeFuel you earn, according to Business Insider. The FuelBand can either sync to your PC through a USB connection or via Bluetooth to an iPhone app. From there you can keep all your stats in one place and set goals for yourself. We havent seen the MotoACTV gain a whole lot of traction thus far, and we all remember what a failure the Jawbone UP was. Hopefully Nikes offering will have more success than the competition.
