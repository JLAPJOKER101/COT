An estimated 120,000 people demonstrated across Germany on Monday, protest organizers said, demanding an end to the use of nuclear power and increasing pressure on Chancellor Angela Merkel&rsquo;s government to speed up the closing of the country&rsquo;s 17 nuclear plants. Last month, after the nuclear accident in Japan, Mrs. Merkel imposed a moratorium on new nuclear plant construction and temporarily closed seven existing plants.
