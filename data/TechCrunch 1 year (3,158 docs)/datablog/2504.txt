MicroVentures, an online p2p investment service that aims to give accredited investors access to funding deals they might otherwise never see, has raised a $300,000 fund to invest in Facebook through the purchase of private company shares on secondary markets.Bill Clark, founder and CEO of MicroVentures, says it took about 10 minutes for investors to commit $40,000 to the fund in the first ten minutes after the investment was made available on the crowdfunding site, which speaks volumes about how eager people still are for grabbing hold of a (albeit super tiny) slice of the Facebook pie prior to its IPO. Thirty investors ultimately put up $300,000 in total through MicroVentures.The Facebook investment fund was created by MicroAngel Capital Partners, an Austin-based VC management company founded by Clark.Related: Private Stock Transactions Up 73 Percent This Year On SecondMarket
