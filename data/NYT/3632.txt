CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) &mdash; President Hugo Ch&aacute;vez went back to work on Thursday, addressing soldiers at a promotion ceremony and then talking for more than an hour while presiding over a cabinet meeting.        

Vowing to beat cancer, Mr. Ch&aacute;vez showed no apparent signs of weakness as he spoke to his cabinet members, who applauded for him as the meeting ended.        

&ldquo;Here is the government, demonstrating what it&rsquo;s capable of,&rdquo; he said during the meeting, which was broadcast live on state television.        

Raising the issue of his cancer diagnosis, Mr. Ch&aacute;vez said, &ldquo;We will win, and we will live.&rdquo;        

Mr. Ch&aacute;vez also criticized his political adversaries, suggesting the opposition had no chance of defeating him in a presidential election next year. &ldquo;You will never again govern the Venezuelan fatherland,&rdquo; he said.        

&ldquo;We&rsquo;re moving toward 2021,&rdquo; he added, referring to the year he has mentioned at times as a possible moment for his retirement from politics.        

Mr. Ch&aacute;vez shocked the nation when he announced on June 30 that he had undergone surgery in Cuba to remove a cancerous tumor. He provided no details.        

He appeared relaxed and comfortable as he addressed his ministers and reviewed government housing and railway projects.        

Mr. Ch&aacute;vez met earlier in the day with cadets and other soldiers at a military base, where he oversaw the promotion of several hundred soldiers standing in formation in a courtyard.        

The president scoffed at suggestions by some of his opponents and commentators that he had faked his illness, supposedly as part of a re-election strategy.        

&ldquo;After two operations, some have said it&rsquo;s a lie,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If only you saw my abdomen. I&rsquo;m not going to show you, but they&rsquo;re quite a few stitches.&rdquo;
