London Web Summit crowned Seedrs the winner of its startup competition against a crowded field of 19 other competitors today. Managing to gain Financial Services Authority approval for its crowd funding model (in the UK) was deemed an incredibly hard thing to do by the judges, who said they had high hopes its model could kick start a revolution in startup funding. Runner-up position went to BusyFlow, a dashboard for multiple web services. You can check out a run-down of all the other startups here. Deezer also broke the news on stage that its launching an offline browser, and Jolicloud launched its new Jolicloud Me service.Seedrs wins the offer of a £50,000 convertible note from DFJ Esprit, £15,000 in legal services from Orrick, £15,000 in advisory services from KPMG and £4,000 in hardware from HP.In a show which saw 1,000 people attend, London Web Summit just became the biggest tech startup event in the UK (at least until Le Web London arrives in June?).
