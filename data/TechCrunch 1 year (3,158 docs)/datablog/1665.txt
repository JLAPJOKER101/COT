Bad taste. Is nothing off-limits anymore? Im always up for a good satire but this Action Electronics video promo airing on Taiwanese for the Action Pad misses the mark. Its not the turtle neck, stage, or even the premise. For me its the angel wings and halo. The little props takes the ad from a tasteless parody to an absurd stunt. But personal feelings aside, this company won. Their ad spot went viral and the Action Pad wont go unnoticed.PC World spoke with an Action Electronics spokesperson who indicated theyre not trying to use his death. She added This is not meant to make fun of Jobs. The tablet in question is just another budget 7-inch Android tablet. It runs Android 2.3.3 and costs 6990 yuan ($236 USD)  nothing special besides the marketing.The commercial started airing on Taiwanese TV late last month. The company even held a mock press conference with the impersonator, which is slightly less offensive because of the lack of angel wings and halo.Apple is known to aggressively defend its image and Steve Jobs likeness and generally quickly releases the legal hounds. But this is a slightly different case. This isnt a Steve Jobs action figure. This is some company, desperate to sell their wares, turning to a dirty tactic that they knew would go viral. Its hard to hate on swaggering bravado even if the result is fucking ridiculous and rude.
