Why do so many great companies fail? Professor Clay Christensen of the Harvard Business School argued they fail because of something he called The Innovators Dilemma  a term he popularized to describe the way in which smart companies become prisoners of their own innovation. So is it possible to escape the innovators dilemma? I had the honor of interviewing Clay at The Economists Innovation event in Berkeley last week where the great man talked to me about how Google might escape the innovators dilemma, why he worries about Apples future, how to effectively innovate in education and healthcare and why most business school professors get the economy so wrong.This is the second in a week long series of interviews from the Innovation event. Tomorrow, check out my interviews with Vivek Wadhwa on racism in Silicon Valley and GE marketing chief, Beth Comstock, on the oldest start-up in the world.
