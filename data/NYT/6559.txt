Protesters who have driven the local authorities from their southern Chinese village of Wukan said Monday that they would march to a nearby town on Wednesday unless the police released four of their representatives and met other conditions. Huang Hancan said that about 6,000 protesters from Wukan would try to march the nearly three miles to Lufeng unless the detainees are freed, farmland is returned and local officials are replaced. A march could pose a direct challenge to the police, who have set up checkpoints on main roads to Wukan.
