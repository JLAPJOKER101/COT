Parliament approved a referendum on Friday to extend President Nursultan Nazarbayev&rsquo;s  rule for a third decade, clearing the way for him to bypass two elections. The proposed referendum averts potential challenges to Mr. Nazarbayev, 70, left, in elections scheduled for 2012 and 2017. More than half of Kazakhstan&rsquo;s nine million registered voters have also signed a petition to extend Mr. Nazarbayev&rsquo;s term until 2020. &ldquo;The will of our people is law,&rdquo; said Yerlan Nigmatulin, a member of Parliament. Mr. Nazarbayev has led the former Soviet republic since 1989.
