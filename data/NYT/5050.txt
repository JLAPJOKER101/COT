KATMANDU, Nepal &mdash; Nineteen people, including three Americans, died in a plane crash in Nepal on Sunday as they headed back to the capital, Katmandu, after a sightseeing tour of the mountains, including Mount Everest, officials said.        

The 3-member crew died in the crash of the Buddha Air flight, as did 10 Indian citizens, 2 Nepalis and a Japanese citizen, according to the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal at the Tribhuvan International Airport, which is not far from the crash site.        

A spokeswoman for the United States Embassy, Heather Steil, said the embassy was in touch with Nepalese authorities to confirm the identities of the Americans on board. &ldquo;Consular officials will reach out the families of the victims and offer whatever service we can provide,&rdquo; she said.        

According to Rishikesh Sharma, a senior official at the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal, the plane lost contact with the Tribhuvan airport 42 minutes after taking off.        

Raj K.C., a witness, told Kantipur Television that the plane was flying low amid thick fog in the skies above Badegaun, a few miles from the airport.        

&ldquo;I heard the plane exploding and saw fire as it crashed on the land,&rdquo; he said.        

Television channels showed the debris of the plane scattered at the crash site.        

Nepal&rsquo;s government announced an investigation into the cause of the crash a few hours after the accident. The flight passenger list and hotel records showed that the Indian citizens were traveling in a group.
