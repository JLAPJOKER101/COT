The Netherlands said Monday that it would recall the Dutch ambassador to Iran for consultations over the execution of a Dutch-Iranian woman. A Dutch Foreign Ministry spokesman said the ambassador would make a formal protest to the Iranian Foreign Ministry before he returned to The Hague on Thursday. The Netherlands froze diplomatic contacts with Iran after the woman, Zahra Bahrami, was reported to have been hanged last month for drug smuggling. Her family said the charge was fabricated after she was arrested for joining antigovernment protests in 2009.
