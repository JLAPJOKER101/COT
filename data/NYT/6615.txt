The American linguist Noam Chomsky, a prominent source of intellectual inspiration for President Hugo Ch&aacute;vez, made a new appeal on Wednesday for the release of Mar&iacute;a Lourdes Afiuni, a judge arrested two years ago by the secret intelligence police. The detention of Judge Afiuni, who was given two additional years of house arrest in December, has raised concern over the erosion of judicial independence in Venezuela. In July, Mr. Chomsky requested clemency for Judge Afiuni, who was arrested after she released a Venezuelan businessman from detention. The new appeal, made in a public letter to Mr. Ch&aacute;vez, detailed the death threats and other abuses suffered by Judge Afiuni during more than a year in a women&rsquo;s prison, and her inability now to leave her home. &ldquo;After more than two years in custody, there are no guarantees of a fair trial,&rdquo; Mr. Chomsky wrote. &ldquo;I am convinced that Judge Afiuni has suffered enough.&rdquo;
