The police in Tunis used tear gas on Friday to disperse thousands of people protesting the TV broadcast of &ldquo;Persepolis,&rdquo; an animated film Islamists have called blasphemous, and a mob firebombed the home of the TV station&rsquo;s owner. The owner, who has apologized for broadcasting the film, was not at home, and no injuries were reported. The movie, about growing up in Iran during the 1979 Islamic Revolution, includes a depiction of God, which is considered sacrilegious. There have been protests in five other cities, and another on Sunday in Tunis.
