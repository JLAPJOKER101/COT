Afghanistan got a new line of credit on Tuesday from the International Monetary Fund, which said the government had taken steps to address governing and accountability issues that had surfaced during a scandal at the Kabul Bank. The fund suspended its credit program for the country more than a year ago, in part because of fraud at the bank, the country&rsquo;s largest private financial institution, which had caused losses that initially exceeded $900 million. The fund said Tuesday it had approved a three-year $133.6 million loan for Afghanistan. The decision is expected to reassure international donors, some of whom had withheld aid in recent months.
