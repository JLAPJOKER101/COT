A court refused bail Thursday for a human rights activist who had been sentenced to life in prison on charges of aiding Maoist rebels, despite an appeal for his freedom from 40 Nobel laureates. The activist, Binayak Sen, 60, a physician and government critic, sought bail while appealing his conviction. Dr. Sen and his supporters say he treated rebels  at a prison in Raipur but deny that he passed notes between jailed rebels and their compatriots in the field. His lawyer said he would appeal the bail decision to the Supreme Court.
