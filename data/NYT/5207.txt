Japan will go ahead with whaling in the Antarctic this year under heightened security to fend off activists who have vowed to disrupt the annual hunt, the country&rsquo;s fisheries minister said Tuesday. Japan&rsquo;s whale hunts have become increasingly tense because of clashes with the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society. The most recent expedition was cut short after several confrontations. But the fisheries minister, Michihiko Kano, said that measures would be taken to ensure the whalers&rsquo; safety. The hunt is expected to begin in December.
