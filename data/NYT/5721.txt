British lawmakers published internal documents from Rupert Murdoch&rsquo;s now-defunct tabloid The News of the World on Tuesday, raising further questions over the extent to which the phone hacking scandal there was covered up. The documents, unearthed during Parliamentary investigations into allegations the tabloid illegally intercepted the voice mails of thousands of newsworthy figures, include e-mails between senior executives at the British arm of Mr. Murdoch&rsquo;s global media empire and their lawyers.        

Several News of the World journalists are named in the correspondence, appearing to contradict statements the company made until early this year that the practice was limited to one &ldquo;rogue reporter.&rdquo; Mr. Murdoch&rsquo;s son James, who runs his father&rsquo;s European and Asian operations, has denied any knowledge of widespread wrongdoing and will give evidence to Parliament for the second time this year on Nov. 10.
