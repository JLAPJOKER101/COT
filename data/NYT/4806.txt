Gunmen bombed a police station in northern Nigeria and robbed a nearby bank on Monday, in an attack similar to others carried out by an extremist Muslim sect in the region. Heavy gunfire could be heard throughout the city of Misau in Bauchi State as the attackers detonated a powerful explosive inside a police precinct, reducing it to rubble, witnesses said. The gunmen killed at least four police officers and a civilian in the attack, said a witness, Adamu Misau, who follows local custom in using the name of the city for his last name. The attack bore similarities to others carried out by a sect known as Boko Haram, which is trying to impose strict Islamic law in the country.
