Some stores in Norway are removing certain computer games and war toys from their shelves out of respect for victims of the recent killings on the island of Utoya and in Oslo, Swedish Radio News reported Tuesday. Coop, a supermarket chain, removed the online game World of Warcraft and about 10 other games; Anders Behring Breivik, who claimed responsibility for the murders, was a regular in talk forums for players of World of Warcraft.
