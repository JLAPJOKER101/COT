To celebrate the opening of their new AT&T Foundry in Palo Alto, AT&T is talking about some of the ambitious projects that they and their partner developers have been cooking up. One of the most interesting so far is AT&T Messages, which attempts to make all of your messages, voicemails, and call logs accessible from multiple devices.Their cloud communications concept sounds quite a bit like the messaging half of Google Voice, but AT&T Messages has a few distinct advantages. One big one is the fact that it integrates with your existing AT&T phone number without any extra legwork. Any message sent to an existing AT&T number gets pushed into the cloud, where its viewable from any other compatible device.Another thing: while Google Voice does an excellent job of making text messages and voicemails viewable on nearly anything with a web connection, it simply cant deal with MMS messages. AT&T Messages plays with multimedia messages just fine, meaning that users who bounce between devices wont have to live without all the funny cat pictures their friends send them.A beta version of the Android app has been floating around for a few weeks, but it was just updated today, presumably to fix a few usability issues. Once the app has been installed, users can log into AT&Ts messaging portal from a computer to pick up from exactly where they left off. AT&T says that there is an iOS version in the works, and that a tablet compatible version will be released this fall.
