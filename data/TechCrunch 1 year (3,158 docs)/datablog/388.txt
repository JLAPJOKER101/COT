And like that, Google is officially in the tablet hardware business. Google is mere minutes away from kicking off its yearly I/O conference and perhaps the biggest news of the show, the announcement of the Nexus 7, was spoiled by the Google Play Store. Here is the Google/Asus Nexus 7 in all its glory.Both 8GB and 16GB models pack a 7-inch 1280800 HD display (216 ppi) back-lit IPS display covered in Scratch-resistant Corning glass. A Tegra 3 SoC powers Jelly Bean (Android 4.1) and Google promises the 4325 mAh battery should provide up to 8 hours of use. Theres NFC, GPS and a 1.2MP front-facing camera.Contrary to the leak early today, ICSs menu bar is still intact with a row of icons positioned above it. You can see Jelly Beans slightly tweaked interface in the video below.Pricing is inline with the rumors. The 8GB will go for $199 with the 16GB hitting at $249. For a limited time, buyers will get $25 in Google Play store credit with the purchase. Google is taking pre-orders now with shipping expected in 2-3 weeks.The video might not work.
