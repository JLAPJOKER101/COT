PARIS &mdash; Gunther von Hagens says he is dying, and he wants to put his preserved corpse on display  as part of his popular &ldquo;Body Worlds&rdquo; exhibitions.        

Mr. Hagens is the anatomist and artist who invented a process that infuses body parts with synthetic resin, the basis of the touring exhibitions of skinless bodies in lifelike poses or dissected, their muscles, nerves and tendons revealed in morbid detail. Other animals are also plastinated, including a giraffe that reportedly took three years to process. Mr. Hagens&rsquo;s shows have drawn more than 20 million viewers and pulled in more than $200 million.        

But Mr. Hagens, who turns 66 on Jan. 10, has told the German tabloid Bild that he is suffering from Parkinson&rsquo;s disease and that his wife &ldquo;will plastinate my body,&rdquo; and &ldquo;my plastinated corpse will then stand in a welcoming pose at the entrance of my exhibition.&rdquo;        

A man who has always loved publicity and controversy, Mr. Hagens gave no indication of how long he expected to live, but typically patients with Parkinson&rsquo;s, a degenerative disorder of the central nervous system, live for years after a diagnosis.        

Born Gunther Liebchen in a part of Germany that is now in Poland,   he grew up in East Germany. He managed to get to the West and got a doctorate in 1975 from the University of Heidelberg.        

In 2002, Mr. Hagens &mdash; who is also a medical doctor &mdash; performed a public autopsy in a London theater before a paying audience of some 500 people, an event that was also televised. But despite advance warnings that he was breaking 19th-century laws requiring special licenses for public dissection, the police did not arrest him. In 2009, in Berlin, he drew criticism by showing plastinated corpses in sexual congress.        

In Germany he is sometimes called Dr. Tod, or Dr. Death.
