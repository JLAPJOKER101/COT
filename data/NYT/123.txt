The president of Ghana, John Atta Mills, said Friday that his country was not able to send troops to oust the leader of Ivory Coast, Laurent Gbagbo, who is unwilling to cede office after losing last month&rsquo;s presidential election. The announcement could complicate a move by a regional bloc of 15 nations in West Africa to mount a military intervention in order to allow the internationally recognized winner of the election, Alassane Ouattara, to take office. He and his staff are barricaded inside a hotel, their exits blocked by soldiers loyal to Mr. Gbagbo.    The United States, the European Union, the African Union and the United Nations General Assembly have recognized Mr. Ouattara as the president.
