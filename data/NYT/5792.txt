MAIDUGURI, Nigeria (AP) &mdash; Militants staged a series of attacks in northeast Nigeria on Friday, including bombing a military base and a theological college, police and military officials said.        

It was not clear how many people were killed or wounded, and no group claimed responsibility. But suspicion immediately fell on a radical Muslim sect, Boko Haram, which has staged bombings and assassinations across Nigeria&rsquo;s Muslim north. This year alone, the group&rsquo;s attacks have killed more than 240 people, according to The Associated Press.        

The attacks on Friday appeared to be the boldest and most coordinated ever carried out by Boko Haram, whose name means &ldquo;Western education is sacrilege.&rdquo;        

The attacks struck in Maiduguri, the sect&rsquo;s spiritual home in Nigeria&rsquo;s arid and impoverished northeast. One explosion was detonated outside the El-Kanemi Theological College, where parents had gathered and others were attending Friday Prayer at a mosque on campus, said the police commissioner of Borno State, Simeon Midenda.        

Witnesses said they saw ambulances carry away at least six wounded people from the college.        

A short time later, suicide bombers in a black S.U.V. tried to enter a military base, said Lt. Col. Hassan Ifijeh Mohammed, a military spokesman. When the S.U.V. was stopped from entering, the explosives inside were detonated outside a gate, damaging buildings and wounding several soldiers, Colonel Mohammed said.        

There were three other explosions in Maiduguri, but no one was killed, Colonel Mohammed said. Government officials routinely play down such attacks in Nigeria, however, because of political considerations.        

Hours later, another powerful car bomb was detonated in Damaturu, the capital of Yobe State, about 80 miles from Maiduguri, said a police commissioner. Two soldiers were wounded, and the militants who parked the vehicle apparently escaped, he said.
