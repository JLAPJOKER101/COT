Prosecutors filed a second criminal case against former President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo on Thursday, this time over a deal with the Chinese company ZTE to create a national broadband network. Mrs. Arroyo, detained on separate electoral fraud charges, has denied wrongdoing in the latest case, which involves accusations of huge kickbacks. Under public pressure in 2008, she canceled the deal. Her husband, Jose Miguel Arroyo, and a former elections chief, who are among those named in the case, have previously denied accusations of receiving millions of dollars in kickbacks in the deal.
