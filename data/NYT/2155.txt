BEIRUT, Lebanon &mdash; Protests erupted Wednesday in the town that unleashed Syria&rsquo;s five-week uprising, and security forces detained a prominent organizer in the restive city of Homs, casting into doubt government pledges to repeal the harsh emergency laws and grant civil rights in one of the Arab world&rsquo;s most repressive countries.        

Though the demonstrations in Dara&rsquo;a and elsewhere paled before those of past days, organizers vowed to turn out their largest numbers yet on what protesters have begun to call &ldquo;Great Friday.&rdquo; Some residents said security forces were already deploying in the hopes of dampening the turnout, and organizers across Syria called the day potentially decisive for the uprising&rsquo;s momentum.        

The demonstrations may serve as a referendum of sorts on the declaration by President Bashar al-Assad&rsquo;s government that it would repeal the emergency laws in place since 1963 and institute a series of reforms like allowing civil liberties and abolishing draconian courts. Some have called the promises a hard-won gain of an uprising that has shaken the Assad family&rsquo;s 40 years of control, while others have been dismissive of initiatives that may prove elusive and that seemed aimed at blunting the demonstrations&rsquo; momentum.        

&ldquo;People don&rsquo;t trust the regime anymore,&rdquo; said Haitham Maleh, a former judge and an often imprisoned human rights activist in Damascus, Syria&rsquo;s capital. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that the Syrian people are going to stop before they bring down this regime.&rdquo;        

But Syria is a complicated country, with sizable minorities of Christians and heterodox Muslim sects that have looked with trepidation to the example offered by Iraq&rsquo;s civil war. The prospect that Mr. Maleh raised &mdash; the government&rsquo;s fall &mdash; has alarmed some, particularly among the minorities, who worry about society&rsquo;s lack of independent institutions to navigate a transition and the fearsome prospect of score-settling in chaos.        

&ldquo;Everything is possible today,&rdquo; said Michel Kilo, another government critic in Damascus. &ldquo;If the regime believes that with security they can handle everything, then they will be turning Syria into a breeding ground for all kinds of extremist movements.&rdquo;        

Residents said that thousands turned out for a protest in Dara&rsquo;a, a city in southwestern Syria where the uprising was galvanized last month. Demonstrators headed toward the Omari Mosque, which has served as a rallying point. Sheik Ahmed Siasna, a cleric at the mosque, said the march ended peacefully.        

Human rights groups said that other protests occurred at the University of Damascus, Aleppo University and Baniyas, a town near the coastal city of Latakia, where Syrian state television said the head of political security had been dismissed, apparently to mollify angry residents. Though the protests were relatively small, they defied an Interior Ministry warning, issued a day earlier, that the government would tolerate no protests.        

In Homs, more funerals were organized for demonstrators killed Tuesday in a government crackdown on one of the country&rsquo;s largest gatherings so far, in which organizers sought to replicate a Cairo-style sit-in.        

&ldquo;It&rsquo;s O.K., don&rsquo;t worry, we will finish it on Friday,&rdquo; an organizer who gave his name as Abu Haydar quoted people as chanting at the funerals on Wednesday.        

&ldquo;There are security forces everywhere, in every corner of the city, and it is not clear what is going to happen,&rdquo; he said by telephone from Homs, Syria&rsquo;s third largest city.        

Mr. Assad&rsquo;s government, which seems to have staggered amid the breadth and persistence of the protests, has hewed to a policy of crackdown and promised compromise, with Tuesday&rsquo;s decrees the latest to suggest it is willing to end decades of authoritarianism. One of its newspapers, Al Watan, called those decrees &ldquo;a strategic program of political reforms aimed at strengthening the democratic process.&rdquo;        

But human rights advocates said arrests had continued. Wissam Tarif, the executive director of Insan, a Syrian human rights group, said 14 people had been detained since the declaration, seven of them in Homs. Among them was Mahmoud Issa, an opposition figure who was arrested at his house after giving an interview to Al Jazeera television.        

&ldquo;The emergency law might have been erased from the papers, but practically speaking, nothing has changed,&rdquo; said a protester in Homs who gave his name as Mohammed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just talk and talk, promises and more promises. And it&rsquo;s all untrue.&rdquo;        

The question of credibility may prove to be one of the state&rsquo;s greatest challenges. Had the reforms been announced weeks before, they would probably have been a turning point in Syria&rsquo;s modern history, or at least a pivotal fissure in the facade of an enduring dictatorship. Some intellectuals in Syria have already deemed it as such.        

&ldquo;Is this enough to satisfy the protesters? I think we have to wait and see,&rdquo; said Sami Moubayed, a professor of international relations at the University of Kalamoon, Syria&rsquo;s first private university. &ldquo;But they&rsquo;ve really accelerated the pace of reform.&rdquo;        

&ldquo;An unpopular cabinet was sacked,&rdquo; Mr. Moubayed added. &ldquo;Unpopular governors were sacked. Wages were raised. There will be citizenship for the stateless. All the demands that were spoken on Day 1 of the protests are coming into effect.&rdquo;        

But the very timing may prove the reforms&rsquo; undoing. While the government has insisted that the uprising is led by militant Islamists and supported from abroad, the protesters themselves seem to have a momentum that force has so far failed to blunt.        

&ldquo;They can&rsquo;t go forward, and they can&rsquo;t go backward,&rdquo; said Amr al-Azm, a professor of Middle Eastern history at Shawnee State University in Ohio. &ldquo;They can&rsquo;t really escalate the pace of reform because that will mean dismantling the regime, and they can&rsquo;t escalate the violence without bringing on other serious problems.&rdquo;        

&ldquo;They&rsquo;re contradicting themselves,&rdquo; he added.
