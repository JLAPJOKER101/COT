The state withdrew a charge of criminal abuse of office on Monday against Energy Minister Elton Mangoma, a leader of the Movement for Democratic Change that has opposed President Robert Mugabe. Mr. Mangoma had been scheduled to go on trial on Monday. The state also further downgraded charges against Munyaradzi Gwisai and five other activists who had been accused in February of plotting to topple Mr. Mugabe after watching videos of the uprising in Egypt. The original treason charge has been replaced by a charge of conspiring to commit public violence and participating in a gathering to promote violence. They are scheduled for trial on Aug. 22.
