OTTAWA &mdash; When the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, or William and Kate to the crowd here, arrived in Canada on Thursday for their first official foreign visit as a married couple, comparisons to Princess Diana&rsquo;s inaugural visit here in 1983 were probably inevitable.        

&ldquo;When Diana was here you couldn&rsquo;t walk down the streets because of the crowds,&rdquo; said Lucie Desjardins, who was among the crowd at Canada&rsquo;s National War Memorial on Thursday trying to catch a glimpse of the royal couple. While the thousands there could not match the crushing scale of 28 years ago, they were loud and enthusiastic, repeatedly chanting the duchess&rsquo;s name.        

Ms. Desjardins said she hoped that the celebrity newlyweds would rekindle interest in the monarchy in Canada, which is subject to the British throne. Queen Elizabeth II still enjoys widespread respect here, but years of royal scandals, the divorce that spoiled the Diana dream and growing apathy have raised the possibility that the institution could wither away from lack of interest.        

On Thursday, the royal couple offered little beyond their presence to generate excitement. They laid a wreath at the war memorial, shook some hands, then moved on to the governor general&rsquo;s residence, where they were to spend the night, and shook some hands.        

William began a brief speech in French, mocking his lack of fluency, before switching to English to praise Canada and Canadians.        

&ldquo;The geography of Canada is unsurpassed and famous for being matched only by the hospitality of its peoples,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re so very excited to have this opportunity to experience both and learn much more about this amazing country.&rdquo;        

At the war memorial, Ms. Desjardins&rsquo; hourlong stakeout atop a park bench produced a digital snapshot of the royal visitors emerging from their Cadillac.        

&ldquo;They&rsquo;re royalty but they&rsquo;re real people,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;She used to wear off the rack.&rdquo; (On Thursday, however, Kate sported couture from design houses in Toronto and Montreal.)        

Randy McIntyre, who was clinging to a lamppost for a view, said the best thing Prince Charles could do for the monarchy would be to give up the throne to William after the queen&rsquo;s death. No one in the crowd challenged the idea.        

Robert Finch, the chairman of the Monarchist League of Canada, said the visit had already increased membership inquiries. He said he had been trying to move his group away from &ldquo;the coronation commemorative plate set&rdquo; to make it into a group that can &ldquo;Canadianize&rdquo; the symbolism of the monarchy and promote its value as head of state.        

It is not, he admitted, an easy task. &ldquo;Many Canadians may think we&rsquo;re dreadfully boring,&rdquo; he said. He added that while the royals enjoy a life of great wealth and privilege, it is not without costs to their personal lives.        

&ldquo;The fact that the queen can&rsquo;t change her hairstyle because she has to look like the person on her money, that&rsquo;s an example of a big sacrifice,&rdquo; Mr. Finch said.        

While William and Kate will help the monarchy&rsquo;s cause, he added, most Canadians see the visit as little more than a fashion show and a chance to gawk at celebrities. &ldquo;So few Canadians are engaged in the monarchy-republican question, that it&rsquo;s a fringe issue,&rdquo; he said.
