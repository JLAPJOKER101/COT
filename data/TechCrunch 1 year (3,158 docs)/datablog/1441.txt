Tello, a SaaS and mobile app that allows customers to give businesses realtime feedback on customer service, has raised $2.7 million in new funding led by True Ventures and Bullpen Capital. The company, which debuted at TechCrunch Disrupt in 2010, previously raised $1 million in seed funding from Dave McClure, True Ventures, Founder Collective, Chris Sacca, Aydin Senkut, Russ Siegelman, Marc Goines, Ron Conway, Naval Ravikant, and Shervin Pishevar.On the consumer side, Tello is a free web and mobile service that aggregates ratings for businesses from across the web and allows users to post comments about their experience at a business. Users can provide feedback on specific employees, recommend an employee and share a positive or negative story about them. Via iPhone and Android apps, users can select a specific business, choose an employee at the business and rate the service with a thumbs up or a thumbs down.With Tello’s mobile apps, people can even specify employee names and provide specific feedback on an individual.Today, Tello is also launching Tello for Business, a new service that helps businesses of any size improve by enabling instant feedback via customers’ mobile devices. Tello for Business allows businesses to be immediately notified of feedback and can respond instantly to acknowledge praise or resolve issues in real-time. The basic version of Tello for Business is free to businesses with up to three locations, while the premium version is $99 per location per month, and adds the ability for businesses to respond both publicly and privately to the ratings.Tello for Business customers can view detailed dashboards with a live ratings feed that provide customized views of customer feedback, business metrics and employee ratings. Until now, Tello has been manually forwarding any complaints or requests to the business, so giving businesses the ability to manage customer feedback in real time should be attractive to consumers using Tello as well.Founder and CEO Joe Beninato tells us that the new funding will be used for growth, specifically hiring for the engineering and product team as well as for sales and marketing. The funds will also be used to acquire businesses to join Tello.
