Alphonso Labs, the fledgling company behind Pulse, a nifty social news reader for iPhone, iPad and Android devices used by roughly 5 million people, aims to pose a challenge to simple bookmarking tool Instapaper (and a range of other bookmarking and read it later apps).The startup is today debuting both a bookmarklet and a Chrome add-on that enables users to save stories to Pulse with a mouse click. Extensions for other browsers are in the works, Im told.Saving to Pulse of course means you can bookmark interesting stories you find on the Web in order to read them later on your Android or iPhone handset, or your iPad. No other bells and whistles at this point, but its a clean and functional bookmarking app.Its also clearly pretty much what Instapaper does (quite elegantly, I might add), but more than anything it is a welcome addition to the Pulse service that will likely not affect Instapaper usage all that much  I see myself using both alongside each other, actually.Like Safaris new Reading List feature, none will kill the other. As Instapaper creator Marco Arment once wrote, the market is big enough for multiple modern-day bookmarking services to thrive.
