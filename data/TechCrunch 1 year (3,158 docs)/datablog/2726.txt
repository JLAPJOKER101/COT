Aloha! You know where I wish I were right now? Thats right, Maui! You know who else is in Maui? Some of the Google Social team. Note: I am really jealous of anyone who is a Googler in Maui right now, because it sure beats being someone who has to write about being a Googler in Maui right now.According to unpaid blogger Michael Arrington, Im not alone in my jealousy, as some other people who worked on Google+ apparently werent included in the Google Maui trip, and wish they were. Makes sense.Meanwhile, Facebook PR just invited me to a meeting next Wednesday to discuss the recently introduced Facebook Timeline features. According to our sources, Facebook also plans on announcing its iPad app and unveil Project Spartan early next week. And, as far as I can tell from trolling Instagram, there are not 450+ Facebookers hanging out by the beach right now (Ive emailed Facebook PR for confirmation of this.)Facebookers? We never really had a formal term, I think thats a reasonable portmanteau, said a person familiar with the matter. I think Yahoo! made it uncool.Click through Googler Chris Messinas Hawaii pics, below.Circles image above: Eider OliveiraÂ via Liz Gannes
