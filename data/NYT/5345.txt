Prime Minister David Cameron has taken the first formal step toward a constitutional change that would allow girls and women to ascend to the British throne before their younger brothers. Mr. Cameron told the House of Commons on Wednesday that he had written to the governments of 15 other Commonwealth nations that recognize Queen Elizabeth as head of state urging their acceptance of a change in the succession rules set by the Act of Settlement, adopted in 1701, which stipulates that male children have precedence over their older sisters in succession to the throne. Mr. Cameron also urged that the law be changed to eliminate a prohibition on the accession of any monarch who is married to a Roman Catholic, calling the ban an &ldquo;historical anomaly.&rdquo; The changes are said to have broad support in the other Commonwealth nations, though some are said to have reservations about opening a discussion out of concern that it might reopen potentially acrimonious debate on whether the monarchy should be abolished.
