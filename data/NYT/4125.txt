The United Nations declared three new regions in Somalia to be famine zones on Wednesday, expanding the area where the highest rates of malnutrition and deaths are taking place, including the refugee camps in the capital of Mogadishu. Two other areas had earlier been declared famine zones, and the United Nations said that famine is likely to spread across all regions of Somalia&rsquo;s south in the next four to six weeks. Earlier on Wednesday, an official with the African Union said a donor conference to raise aid money had been postponed for at least two weeks because it had not been scheduled with enough notice to allow heads of state to attend.
