A team of election experts will recommend that Haiti&rsquo;s government-backed candidate be eliminated from a presidential runoff ballot due to strong evidence of fraud in voting that led to riots, according to a draft of the report. The report by the Organization of American States team has not been released, but officials confirmed its conclusions, including that the disputed Nov. 28 vote should neither be thrown out nor recounted, and that enough fraudulent or improper ballots should be invalidated to drop the governing-party candidate, Jude C&eacute;lestin, into third place and out of the second-round runoff. That would favor a singer, Michel Martelly, a populist candidate who was in third place and out of contention. A former first lady, Mirlande Manigat, would remain in first place.
