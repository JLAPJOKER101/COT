Brazil&rsquo;s agriculture minister, Wagner Rossi, resigned Wednesday amid accusations of influence peddling leveled in the news media. Mr. Rossi is the fourth official to fall &mdash; and the third to step down because of corruption accusations &mdash; since President Dilma Rousseff took office just eight months ago. &ldquo;Accusations in the past 30 days have been false and without any proof of improper or illegal actions,&rdquo; Mr. Rossi said in his resignation letter.
