Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed. Send the Trend had previously raised $3 million from Battery Ventures and Founder Collective.Send the Trend offers its customers personalized, affordable accessories such as fashion jewelry, sunglasses, scarves and more.

You can then buy any of the items for $30, with free shipping included for U.S. customers.As weve written in the past, Send The Trend aims to differentiate itself through curation and personalization features. Last year, the startup launched MyStyle, which allows you to create an online Send the Trend store filled with your favorite accessories from the site. You can upload your picture, choose the words that describe your style and Send the Trend will pre-select products based on your preferences. You can also manually add items you like to your MyStyle page.The startup was founded by Divya Gugnani, Mariah Chase and Project Runway winner Christian Siriano.So what does QVC want with Send The Trend? According to the company, QVCs e-commerce could be paired with Send the Trendâ€™s use of customization and personalization. Additionally, Send the Trend will continue to operate as a separate e-commerce site. The New York Post reported a few days ago that the startup was set to be acquired by a TV company but it was unclear who the acquirer was.
