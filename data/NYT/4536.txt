CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) &mdash; President Hugo Ch&aacute;vez thanked Venezuelans on Sunday for praying for his health as he undergoes a third round of chemotherapy at a military hospital in Caracas, this time getting the cancer treatment at home rather than Cuba.        

Mr. Ch&aacute;vez walked into the Dr. Carlos Arvelo Military Hospital late Saturday, accompanied by his daughter Rosa and aides. He said his treatment has been going well and aims to prevent the reappearance of cancer cells more than two months after he underwent surgery to remove a cancerous tumor.        

&ldquo;From here, I join all these prayers and Masses for the health of all of us,&rdquo; Mr. Ch&aacute;vez wrote in a Twitter message on Sunday. &ldquo;God bless you!&rdquo;        

State television broadcast footage of a prayer meeting in the president&rsquo;s home state of Barinas, where dozens of Venezuelans listened to a priest who urged government supporters to pray for the quick recovery of Mr. Ch&aacute;vez.        

&ldquo;We love you &mdash; your mother, your father and your brothers and all of your family and friends,&rdquo; Hugo de los Reyes Ch&aacute;vez, the president&rsquo;s father, said at the prayer meeting.        

&ldquo;Take care of yourself in this battle,&rdquo; he added.        

Before entering the hospital, President Ch&aacute;vez said on television on Saturday that he and his team of Cuban and Venezuelan doctors had decided after his latest round of medical tests Friday that it would be all right for him to undergo chemotherapy in Venezuela.        

&ldquo;I&rsquo;m determined to continue living,&rdquo; he said at the hospital. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not time to die. What we have to do still is a great deal.&rdquo;        

Mr. Ch&aacute;vez said he was making arrangements with his vice president, El&iacute;as Jaua, and other officials in order to &ldquo;continue with this rhythm of treatment.&rdquo;        

Mr. Ch&aacute;vez has appeared with his head shaved the past few weeks after his hair began to fall out as a result of chemotherapy.        

The president said Saturday that he expected to disappear from public view in the coming days but would remain in contact with government officials and his supporters by phone and Twitter.        

&ldquo;In the coming hours, between today and tomorrow, we&rsquo;ll be preparing for the third cycle,&rdquo; Mr. Ch&aacute;vez said.
