CHAMAN, Pakistan (AP) &mdash; Eight gunmen attacked tankers carrying fuel for United States and NATO forces in Afghanistan, setting 14 of the vehicles ablaze on Saturday, officials said. The trucks were parked at a roadside restaurant in southwest Pakistan, they said.        

The Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for the assault, in which one driver was wounded.        

Islamist militants and criminals in Pakistan frequently attack trucks carrying supplies for United States and NATO troops. The supplies typically arrive in Pakistan&rsquo;s southern port city of Karachi and travel to neighboring Afghanistan. The latest attack occurred near the town of Dera Murad Jamali in Baluchistan Province, said Fatteh Muhammad, a local government official.        

Azam Tariq, a Pakistani Taliban spokesman, said the militant group was behind the Saturday strike. The police would not speculate on who was responsible.        

&ldquo;We have assigned our fighters to go after the NATO supply tankers wherever in Pakistan,&rdquo; Mr. Tariq said by phone. &ldquo;We want to make very, very difficult all land routes for NATO in Pakistan.&rdquo;        

Meanwhile, in Karachi, Reuters reported that the police had announced Saturday that unidentified gunmen had shot dead at least 17 people in the previous three days in a new wave of violence in the commercial hub.
