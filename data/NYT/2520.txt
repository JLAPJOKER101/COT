India&rsquo;s Supreme Court on Monday overturned a lower court ruling that called for the country&rsquo;s most disputed religious site to be divided between Muslims and Hindus. The Mughal emperor Babur built a mosque at the site, in Ayodhya, in the 16th century. Some Hindus believe that the same spot is the birthplace of the god Ram, and that Babur had destroyed a Hindu shrine to build his mosque. In 1992, Hindu activists tore down the mosque, unleashing sectarian violence in which about 2,000 people were killed, mostly Muslims. In October a court ruled that the site should be split between the two religions, but the Supreme Court rejected that solution, calling it &ldquo;strange.&rdquo; The Supreme Court is expected to rule later on the question of how to resolve control of the site.
