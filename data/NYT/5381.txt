Former President Chen Shui-bian was sentenced Thursday to 18 years in prison, on top of the 17 years he is already serving for corruption. The High Court overturned a lower court&rsquo;s acquittal and said that Mr. Chen took $20 million worth of bribes from two banks involved in merger cases. In 2009, he had been sentenced in a separate case of accepting about $9 million in bribes. A court spokesman said that his total time in prison could not exceed 30 years. Mr. Chen, 61, can appeal the latest ruling.
