The European Union strengthened export controls Tuesday on drugs that can be used to administer the death penalty. European companies producing drugs like sodium thiopental, a sedative legally required for lethal injections in the United States, must now provide assurances that their products will not be used for executions before they can export them. The move further tightened a drug supply shortage that has slowed executions in the United States. The death penalty is banned in the European Union, and since 2008 the 27-member bloc has called for its abolition worldwide.
