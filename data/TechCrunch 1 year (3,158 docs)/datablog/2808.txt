Were just about a year away from the next Presidential election. That means one thing: campaign ads. A shit ton of them. Everywhere.And that includes Twitter.Yes, the old: This message has been approved by. is coming to Twitter starting today. Mitt Romneys campaign is the first to buy one. While they are still technically a part of the Promoted Products suite, Twitter is rolling out small UI changes to distinguish political ads from regular ones, they say. And yes, the FEC disclaimers will be a included in the hover overlay.This project is being led by Twitters Peter Greenberger, a guy they just hired who previously ran political sales for Google. With campaigns looking to spend more online than ever before, this is a smart move by Twitter. And as we get closer to the election, Twitter will undoubtedly play a key role in the political discourse. Of course, both that and the ads will likely piss plenty of users off as well.Ive asked Twitter who will see these political ads — everyone, or just those following candidates (or those tweeting political things)? Ill update when I hear back.Update from Twitter: Theyll function exactly as existing Promoted Products do. The only difference is that political advertising will have a special icon to help users distinguish between political ads & normal promoted stuff, and when people hover over those ads, we will display a pop-up disclaimer identifying who paid for the ad.The key is that theyre not testing these ads in the main timeline at this time. That will be welcomed news for many. Though I imagine that may change as the ads take off.More from Twitter:
