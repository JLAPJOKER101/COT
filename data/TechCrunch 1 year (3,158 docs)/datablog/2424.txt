By any measure Drew Houston and his Dropbox team are having a hugely successful run. In Houstons final Founder Stories episode with TechCrunch editor, Erick Schonfeld, Houston says he plans to maintain this momentum by focusing on mobile, and just about everything else.Houston says Dropbox has secured a new agreement with HTC, where it is going to be baked into tens-of-millions of [Android] phones and like Facebook, Dropbox plans to stamp its product on everything. In 18-months you are going to see little Dropbox buttons everywhere.But will Dropboxs strategy be strong enough to fend off popular sites like Instagram and Twitter, which also store digital content submitted by large user communities? Or put more bluntly five years from now, will I even need Dropbox? asks Schonfeld.Houston believes the answer to both questions is yes.We can help you get stuff out of each of those little silos or little boxes and put them all in one place so that all that content can be more useful to you and we can help you share it and we can help you see it on your iPad or see it on your TV.Well see how it all plays out.Until then, make sure to watch episodes I, II and III of Schonfelds interview with Houston.Past episodes of Founder Stories featuring Eric Ries, Julia Hartz and Christopher Poole are here.
