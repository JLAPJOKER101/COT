Turkey launched a military offensive in the predominantly Kurdish southeast in retaliation for an ambush by Kurdish separatists that killed 13 soldiers on Thursday. Army helicopters were joined by civilian village guards in the operation, the semiofficial Anatolian News Agency reported. The army provided no details on the number of troops involved. The attack on Thursday, near Diyarbakir, was the deadliest ambush by Kurdish separatists in recent years, and Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan vowed that the rebels would pay a heavy price.
