PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti &mdash; President Ren&eacute; Pr&eacute;val and his party, bowing to pressure from regional leaders, including the United States, have begun to encourage their candidate for the coming presidential runoff to drop out, according to party officials.        

But the candidate, Jude C&eacute;lestin, gave no indication that he would follow the request, and on Wednesday, his lawyers filed another petition to election officials elaborating on the reasons he believed he had won a spot in the runoff.        

Haiti has been riveted in recent days by the mounting pressure on Mr. C&eacute;lestin to withdraw as a way to end the stalemate that threatens to ignite more political unrest and block billions of dollars in international assistance.        

Mr. C&eacute;lestin&rsquo;s position became especially precarious after the Organization of American States issued findings that he had come in third in the first round of voting, which would disqualify him from the runoff.        

Mr. Pr&eacute;val had picked Mr. C&eacute;lestin, an engineer with little political experience, to succeed him and has resisted the O.A.S. findings for weeks.        

But after senior Obama administration officials made it clear that Washington would withhold more than $1 billion in aid from Haiti unless there was an election the United States deems credible,  Mr. Pr&eacute;val reversed course, according to party officials and an analyst close to him.        

The funds are crucial as Haiti struggles to rebuild from last year&rsquo;s earthquake.        

The governing party issued a statement on Thursday pressing Mr. C&eacute;lestin to leave the race, but it did not specifically refer to the position taken by Mr. Pr&eacute;val, the party&rsquo;s leader.  The party officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said Mr. Pr&eacute;val had begun encouraging Mr. C&eacute;lestin this week to step down.        

The stalemate arose after the first round of voting in November. Haitian and international monitors acknowledged that the election was rife with fraud. The Haitian government&rsquo;s results &mdash; which found that a former first lady, Mirlande Manigat, and Mr. C&eacute;lestin had won the right to compete in a second round &mdash; were widely considered suspect.        

The O.A.S., which was called in to conduct a review of the results, found that a popular musician, Michel Martelly, narrowly beat Mr. C&eacute;lestin.        

Some here question those results, saying that the conclusion was part of an effort by the United States, France and Canada to guarantee that Mr. Pr&eacute;val would no longer be able to wield any influence over Haiti&rsquo;s highest office.        

The governing party&rsquo;s support for Mr. C&eacute;lestin began to crumble not only over American threats to withhold aid, but also after the United States revoked the visas of several electoral officials close to the candidate.        

Mr. C&eacute;lestin is the only person who can end his candidacy before a ruling by Haiti&rsquo;s electoral council. It is expected to announce by Feb. 7 which of the candidates will compete in the runoff.        

&ldquo;I think he&rsquo;s trying to teach the country a lesson,&rdquo; said one senior international election monitor, referring to Mr. C&eacute;lestin. &ldquo;There is a process in place to determine which candidates have won enough votes to go to the runoff.        

&ldquo;If anyone is going to appear to cave to the will of the United States,&rdquo; the official said, &ldquo;C&eacute;lestin doesn&rsquo;t want it to be him.&rdquo;
