HTC has produced devices running a handful of operating systems over the years, from big names like Android to lightweight options like Qualcomms BREW. What weve never seen though is a device that is HTC through and through  HTC hardware meets HTC OS. The Taiwanese smartphone manufacturer seems to have been thinking the same thing, as company chairwoman Cher Wang has revealed that HTC is considering purchasing their own mobile operating system for use in forthcoming devices.Though the companys intentions have now been outed, Wang makes clear that their next steps are not set in stone. Taiwans Central News Agency has learned that HTC is taking the cautious approach here: while HTC brass have internally discussed their options, Wang makes it clear that their OS purchase (if it ever happens) is not going to be an impulse buy.In spite of their commitment to taking their time, HTC seems a bit nonchalant about introducing a new operating system to their already-ambitious line up. Its likely because they realized that whatever operating system they purchase is only going to be a template upon which the HTC experience will be built. We can use any OS we want, Wang said. We are able to make things different from our rivals on the second or third layer of a platform.At least one of those layers refers to HTCs near-ubiquitous Sense UI, which in one form or another has sat on top of numerous operating systems in recent years. That, coupled with the companys new focus on delivering services like HTC Watch mean that no matter what OS they end up purchasing, the end result should be full-featured and recognizable. Whether or not it will be enough to claim any significant market share is still up in the air, but itll be a real treat to see them try.
