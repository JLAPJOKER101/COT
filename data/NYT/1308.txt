Secretary General Ban Ki-moon is asking his senior managers to help trim the United Nations&rsquo; next spending plan by 3 percent. A spokesman for the United Nations, Martin Nesirky, said Wednesday that Mr. Ban hoped that his top executives would find ways to &ldquo;do more with less&rdquo; as they examined the current $5.5 billion two-year budget for possible cuts while preparing spending proposals for 2012 and 2013.
