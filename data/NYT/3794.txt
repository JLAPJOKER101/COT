A former army officer accused of killing 69 peasants during Peru&rsquo;s war against the Shining Path Maoist guerrillas in the 1980s has been extradited to Peru from the United States to face charges, the police said Friday. The former officer, Telmo Hurtado, is accused of commanding a military patrol that took part in a 1985 massacre in Quebrada de Huancayoc, where army units herded villagers into houses and set them on fire, killing dozens, including 30 children and 27 women. Mr. Hurtado was included in a blanket amnesty granted to military officers in the 1990s but lost his immunity when the Supreme Court nullified the law in 2002, at which point he moved to Miami. He was arrested in 2007.
