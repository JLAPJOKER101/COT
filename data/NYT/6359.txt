After two high-profile killings this week, legislators approved a decree late Wednesday banning motorcyclists from riding with passengers. Alfredo Landaverde, a former antidrug and security adviser to the government, was killed in the capital, Tegucigalpa, on Wednesday. On Tuesday, a radio journalist, Luz Marina Paz Villalobos, and her driver were killed. The suspects in both cases were passengers on motorcycles, who got away. The killings come amid a widening scandal of accusations of police involvement in killings and drug trafficking. Mr. Landaverde was an outspoken critic of police and political corruption.
