PARIS &mdash; The stunning reversals in the criminal case against Dominique Strauss-Kahn, a putative French presidential candidate, have reawakened a dormant anti-Americanism here, fueled by a sense that the raw, media-driven culture of the United States has undermined justice and fair play.        

There was shock in France after the arrest of Mr. Strauss-Kahn in May and intense criticism of the manner in which he was displayed in handcuffs, pulled unshaven into a televised court session and stuffed into a Rikers Island cell under suicide watch. There was confusion and criticism over the glee with which the New York tabloids in particular highlighted every humiliation and turned to clich&eacute;s about the French &mdash; &ldquo;Chez Perv&rdquo; and &ldquo;Frog Legs It&rdquo; &mdash; in the coverage. And there was a sense that it was not just Mr. Strauss-Kahn who was being so jauntily humiliated, but France itself.        

Now, with the case appearing to collapse over questions about the credibility of the hotel housekeeper from Guinea who accused him, and Mr. Strauss-Kahn freed from house arrest, the French are feeling a kind of bitter jubilation of their own, and renewing their criticisms about the rush to judgment, the public relations concerns of elected prosecutors and the somehow uncivilized, brutal and carnival nature of American society, democracy and justice.        

Former Prime Minister Lionel Jospin said Friday that &ldquo;he was thrown to the wolves&rdquo; in the American system; a former justice minister, Robert Badinter, called Mr. Strauss-Kahn&rsquo;s treatment &ldquo;a lynching, a murder by media.&rdquo;        

In an editorial this weekend, Le Monde wrote that &ldquo;the least one can say is that the vagaries of the American procedure&rdquo; had &ldquo;condemned Dominique Strauss-Kahn before even the start of a serious inquiry.&rdquo; Criticizing the &ldquo;media-judicial machine,&rdquo; the paper said the costs to Mr. Strauss-Kahn were heavy, including the loss of his job and his political future. The paper said that with the American system of an elected prosecutor dependent on the voters and the way it functions with the press, with police leaks and &ldquo;terrible photos illegally transmitted to the press and then also illegally reproduced by certain newspapers &mdash; everything was done to place Mr. Strauss-Kahn in a situation of extreme weakness before even the beginning of an inquiry.&rdquo;        

No&euml;lle Lenoir, a former European affairs minister, said many French felt insulted. &ldquo;People were shocked by the media circus,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;They thought the prosecution was making common cause with the tabloids. So there is a bit of revenge for what is seen as very anti-French behavior.&rdquo;        

Though it was the American prosecutors who revealed the housekeeper&rsquo;s various fabrications about her background, her asylum application and her taxes, the turnabout &ldquo;does wake up this slumbering anti-Americanism, and the great losers are American justice and the New York police,&rdquo; said Dominique Mo&iuml;si, a longtime analyst of French-American relations who has studied and taught in the United States. &ldquo;The case does damage to the image of America and recreates negative stereotypes that existed before.&rdquo;        

Even in the 1990s, &ldquo;when we were so close, when the cold war was over and before the second Iraq war, we were divided along the line of the death penalty,&rdquo; Mr. Mo&iuml;si said.        

&ldquo;There is a sense in Europe that you can&rsquo;t be fully civilized with the death penalty,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Now this feeling is reinforced &mdash; that the United States is not a fully civilized country with a police that behaves like that, that wants to humiliate,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;There is a sense that it&rsquo;s a dangerous country.&rdquo;        

These cultural differences, highlighted by the brashness of the American news media coverage, prompted the indulgence in cultural clich&eacute;s on both sides of the Atlantic, reminiscent of the period when France refused to support the Bush administration&rsquo;s war in Iraq and some Americans responded with &ldquo;freedom fries&rdquo; and called the French &ldquo;cheese-eating surrender monkeys.&rdquo;        

The French writer Bernard-Henri L&eacute;vy, an outspoken friend and defender of Mr. Strauss-Kahn, was ubiquitous, writing and speaking of his continuing anger at the &ldquo;pornographic&rdquo; nature of Mr. Strauss-Kahn&rsquo;s treatment and the &ldquo;obscene&rdquo; press conference that the accuser&rsquo;s lawyer held detailing her physical injuries as he tried to rescue her status as victim. Writing for The Daily Beast, the American media Web site, Mr. L&eacute;vy criticized the black-and-white handling of the case, &ldquo;the cannibalization of justice by the sideshow.&rdquo;
