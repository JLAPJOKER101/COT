The United States and Egypt have canceled joint military exercises planned for this year because the Egyptian military is preoccupied running the government since the ouster in February of President Hosni Mubarak. The semiannual exercises, known as &ldquo;Bright Star,&rdquo; have become one of the most significant bonds between the two allies since they were begun 30 years ago after Egypt signed the Camp David accords with Israel. The United States provides Egypt about $1.3 billion in military aid each year as a legacy of the Camp David accords. Military officials in both countries have said they expect to hold the joint military exercises again in 2013.
