We know that many of you visit TechCrunch on the regular for a hearty dose of startup coverage, general tech news and opinionated coverage of the tech zeitgeist.But we also know that the trainwreck posting on our hirings and firings, Aol spats, tech gossip and quibbles between staff is what really gets your fingers clicking and blood boiling.I mean, its like a car accident, you cant help but stare.So to cater to everyone who just visits here just for the drama, were today launching a drama-only new channel, TechCrunch.com/Drama, where you can find such conflict-infused fare as Im Leaving TechCrunch. Heres Why or How The Hell Is It My Fault? or CrunchPad Federal Lawsuit Filed; Some Additional Thoughts.But its not just about navel-gazing and staff changes (though theres plenty of that) certain actual news also qualifies as dramatic, simply by virtue of the spools and spools of comment threads it produces, e.g.Â the leaked Twitter documents.Theres not really a way to define what constitutes a dramatic post, other than when it hits it causes an Internet explosion.Weve heard time and time again that youve missed TechCrunchs swagger, and we agree; So the next time your eyes glaze over while reading the umpteenth re-written press release, click on the Drama link up there on the navigation bar and relive some our sites most superfluous, gut wrenching and annoying coverage.You know you love it.
