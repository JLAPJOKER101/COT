The Samsung Galaxy S II is a very special phone. Even though its been on the market for quite some time now, its still one of the more beastly competitors on Android-flavored shelves. Of course, its always had the price tag to prove it, going for between $230 and $250 just about everywhere. But T-Mobile has a pretty sweet deal going on a white Samsung Galaxy S II for this weekend only, and it could save you up to $130. The white Galaxy S II hasnt been available for that long, so if the new new thing is all that matters to you then fear not. The deal is only available online, so dont go traipsing into a T-Mobile asking for your $99 Samsung Galaxy S II. After a $50 mail-in rebate and a signature on the dotted line of a two-year contract, T-Mobile is slashing $130 off one of the most popular phones of the year. I have yet to see such a great deal on the GS II, so if youre into white phones and are ready to sign your soul over to T-Mobile (possibly, again), head over to T-Mos web site and get the ball rolling.
