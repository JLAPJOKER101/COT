The United States ordered Ecuador&rsquo;s ambassador to leave the country on Thursday and scrapped a round of talks in retaliation for the expulsion of its ambassador in Quito. The State Department spokesman Charles Luoma-Overstreet said Ecuador&rsquo;s &ldquo;unjustified&rdquo; expulsion of the American ambassador, Heather M. Hodges, &ldquo;left us no other option.&rdquo; Ecuador ordered Ms. Hodges out of the country on Tuesday over comments she made in a leaked diplomatic cable that suggested that senior Ecuadorean police officials, and possibly the president, were aware of police corruption.
