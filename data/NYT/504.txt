Armed men raped 60 people in eastern Congo in the last 10 days, the latest in a spate of mass sexual attacks in the region, the United Nations said Friday. Charline Burton, a United Nations spokeswoman, said it was not clear who carried out the attacks in the  Fizi area of South Kivu Province from Jan. 19 to Jan. 21. She said the health organization  Doctors Without Borders had treated 60 people, including men, women and children, who said they had been raped. Several armed groups operate in the area and sexual violence has become common. &ldquo;This is no longer a crisis, it&rsquo;s becoming a culture,&rdquo; said Nene Rukunghu, a local doctor.
