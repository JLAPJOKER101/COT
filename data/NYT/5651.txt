The Palestinian and Arab refusal set off widespread fighting, then Arab militaries attacked Israel after it declared independence the following year, a war the Arab states lost. &ldquo;It was our mistake,&rdquo; the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, above, said in a rare interview on Israeli television. &ldquo;It was an Arab mistake as a whole.&rdquo; Referring to Israel, he added, &ldquo;But do they punish us for this mistake for 64 years?&rdquo;
