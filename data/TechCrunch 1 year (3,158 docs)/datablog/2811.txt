Exclusive - Starting today, Home Shopping Network will begin selling  for the first time  an online storage product on air. With a reach of about 89 million households per week in the United States, this could be quite a big deal for the online storage provider in question.So who is it? Dropbox? Box.net? Mozy? Carbonite? No Sir Ree Bob, its MiMedia (earlier coverage)!Sure, HSN has sold electronics before, but this is actually the first time theyre selling an online file storage service on the air, so consider this a sign that this type of product is going mainstream.MiMedia tells me Home Shopping Network had a number of parameters they needed to adhere to, namely: a lifetime service that costs no more than $50. Also, the product needed to be tangible and shippable. Wait, what?Yes, its kind of ridiculous to sell a 100% digital service as a physical product, but HSN knows its audience very well, so MiMedia complied with everything they asked.What they came up with is an offering that comprises 25 GB of storage, for life, which will be sold for $49.95. To achieve a shippable product, MiMedia will be sending buyers a USB drive with a software loader pre-installed. Yes, still kind of ridiculous, but who knows, it might just work for them.
