One of the most prominent female executives in France was pushed out of her job on Thursday when the French government said it would replace Anne Lauvergeon as chief executive of Areva, one of the world&rsquo;s largest nuclear power companies. Areva, which she created in 2001 in a merger of other nuclear companies, is majority-owned by the state. Ms. Lauvergeon, 51, will be succeeded by Luc Oursel, also 51, who had headed Areva&rsquo;s nuclear reactor business before becoming chief operating officer. Her departure at the end of the month caps a struggle with Henri Proglio &mdash; a favorite of President Nicolas Sarkozy &mdash; who runs the state electric utility, an important Areva customer.
