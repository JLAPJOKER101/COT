S&Atilde;O PAULO, Brazil &mdash; A missing witness to the death of a Roman Catholic bishop during Argentina&rsquo;s military dictatorship was found safe early Thursday after unknown people took him hostage and warned him to back down from testifying in an inquiry into the death, the witness&rsquo;s lawyer said on Thursday.        

The witness, V&iacute;ctor Mart&iacute;nez, 52, had been missing since Monday afternoon and the Argentine president, Cristina Fern&aacute;ndez de Kirchner, had ordered the country&rsquo;s security forces to try to find him, fearing he could be killed.        

Kidnappers grabbed Mr. Mart&iacute;nez, a spokesman for Amnesty International in Argentina, near his home in the Palermo neighborhood of Buenos Aires, then drove away in a windowless van and held him captive in a house, his lawyer, Gabriela Scopel, said.        

Ms. Scopel added that he was found wandering in a sedated state in the Caballito neighborhood.        

&ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t hit him,&rdquo; Ms. Scopel said. &ldquo;They gave him a lot of sedatives to keep him semiconscious.&rdquo;        

She said the government&rsquo;s swift response and the media attention to the disappearance had probably prompted the kidnappers to release him.        

&ldquo;They ordered him to be careful with what he does and what he says in the trial, and they told him to not bother anybody and leave the country,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;They tried to fill him with fear for his life and for his family.&rdquo;        

Mr. Mart&iacute;nez has returned home and is &ldquo;doing much better,&rdquo; but remains in a state of shock, Ms. Scopel said.        

Nilda Garr&eacute;, Argentina&rsquo;s security minister, said early Thursday on Twitter that Mr. Mart&iacute;nez would be examined by a doctor, but the government did not share more details.        

The kidnapping rekindled memories of the 2006 disappearance of Julio L&oacute;pez, a witness in a trial against a senior police official charged with crimes against humanity during the military regime that ruled Argentina from 1976 to 1983. He was never found.        

On July 11, 1977, Mr. Mart&iacute;nez was with Bishop Carlos Horacio Ponce de Le&oacute;n when the bishop was killed in an automobile crash that supposedly was an accident. Mr. Mart&iacute;nez, at the time a 19-year-old conscript, survived the crash and over the years has pressed for an investigation into what happened.        

A federal judge conducting the inquiry was planning to call him to testify. The government has called Manuel Fernando Saint Amant, a former lieutenant colonel, a prime suspect in the bishop&rsquo;s death. He has been prosecuted in the disappearances of several people that occurred during the dictatorship and remains free pending verdicts in those cases.        

Mr. Mart&iacute;nez &ldquo;knew a lot&rdquo; about the bishop, who had treated him as his &ldquo;right-hand man, and like a son,&rdquo; Ms. Scopel said.        

The inquiry has been delayed several times, in part because of tensions between the judge and the prosecutor, she said.
