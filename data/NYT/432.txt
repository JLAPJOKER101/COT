President Ali Abdullah Saleh, left, tried to defuse calls for his ouster, denying claims by opponents that he planned to install his son as his successor and raising salaries for the army. He delivered a televised speech on Sunday night describing talk of his aiming to bequeath power to his son as the &ldquo;utmost rudeness,&rdquo; and announcing pay increases for the armed forces, a step apparently meant to ensure their loyalty. Students and opposition groups, inspired by the revolt in Tunisia, have staged several days of protests calling called for Mr. Saleh&rsquo;s removal. Mr. Saleh has also cut income taxes in half and ordered price controls.
