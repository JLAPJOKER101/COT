Google is launching Chrome for iOS today. Many pundits assumed that Google was holding back Chrome from iOS because it couldnt use its own rendering engine, however, Google just told us that Chrome will actually use the same rendering engine that Apple makes available to every other third-party developer on iOS.Apple famously only makes a sandboxed, slower version of its rendering engine available to developers. Whats slowing this engine down is that , for security reasons (at least thats what Apple says), third-party developers dont get direct access to Apples Nitro JavaScript engine. According to some developers, UIWebView is often up to 3x slower in rendering pages than Safari. You can find a more in-depth discussion of how this works in practice on Quora.Given these limitations, chances are that Chrome on iOS will be significantly slower than on other platforms  and also slower than Apples own Safari browser. Despite all of its convenient features, then, its hard to imagine that Chrome on iOS will find too many regular users (and the fact that Apple doesnt let you switch default browsers doesnt help here either, of course).Here is Googles official statement about this:Our goal was to bring the same fast, secure and stable web browsing experience youâ€™ve come to enjoy when using Chrome on your desktop or Android device, while also adapting to platform specific technical specifications.Rendering and the javascript engine are provided by iOS through UIWebView.
