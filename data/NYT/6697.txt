The United States on Tuesday extradited a Muslim Bosnian woman suspected of killing six Croats in 1993 during a war that ripped the region apart, the prosecutor&rsquo;s office in Sarajevo, Bosnia, said. The woman, Rasema Handanovic, 39, is suspected of taking part in the mass killings of Croatian civilians in Bosnia and Herzegovina in April 1993, when she was a member of a special unit of the Bosnian Army, the prosecutor&rsquo;s office said in a statement. More than 100,000 people were killed during the Bosnian war of 1992 to 1995, and Muslims and Croats fought each other in 1993 and 1994 even though they had entered the conflict as allies against the Bosnian Serbs. Ms. Handanovic, who moved to the United States after the war, is accused of executing by firing squad three civilians and three soldiers of the Croatian Defense Council who had surrendered in the village of Trusina, the statement said. Ms. Handanovic is one of only a few women accused of war crimes committed during the Bosnian conflict.
