Protesters occupying land around St. Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral, part of a worldwide movement against economic inequality, defied a deadline from London authorities on Thursday to remove their sprawling encampment or face legal action. City officials left eviction notices across the camp on Wednesday, saying that unless tents were removed by 6 p.m. Thursday, the city would seek a court eviction order. Hundreds of tents remained after the deadline. Protesters said they had no intention of moving and were wary after forceful police evictions in similar camps across the United States. The legal action will be likely to take weeks, the city said, though the initial hearings could take place as soon as next week. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d still like to sort this without court action,&rdquo; a spokesman said, &ldquo;but from now on we will have to have any talks in parallel with court action, not instead.&rdquo;
