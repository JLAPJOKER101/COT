PESHAWAR, Pakistan (AP) &mdash; A suicide bomber in a school uniform attacked Pakistani troops during morning exercises at an army training camp on Thursday, killing 20 soldiers and wounding 20 others, the police and the military said.        

The attack,  in the northwestern town of Mardan, showed that despite years of army operations against militant hide-outs along Pakistan&rsquo;s border with Afghanistan, the Taliban and fighters linked to Al Qaeda retain the ability to strike back. It was one of the worst attacks on security forces in recent months.        

The army confirmed the casualties and circumstances. A police official, Abdullah Khan, said some of the wounded were in critical condition.        

Despite his apparent disguise, the bomber&rsquo;s ability to get his explosives into the facility undetected signaled a failure by the military. Such army areas are usually heavily guarded, though an attack on the same training facility in 2006 killed 35 soldiers.
