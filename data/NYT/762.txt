MARDAN, Pakistan &mdash; A teenage suicide bomber walked onto the parade ground of a major military training school in northwest Pakistan on Thursday and blew himself up, killing 27 cadets, officials said.        

The attack at the Punjab Regimental Center in Mardan was the second by militants against the school in the last three years.        

The attacker on Thursday, a 15-year-old boy, chose the morning parade lineup to inflict maximum casualties, an army colonel said. He was dressed in the uniform of a civilian school near the military academy compound.        

&ldquo;The boy, dressed in the school&rsquo;s uniform, walked up to the training center and blew himself up,&rdquo; said the colonel, who declined to be identified.        

The complex is one of the biggest training centers for the Pakistani Army.        

In addition to the 27 dead, more than 40 cadets were injured, according to local police officials.        

The army training center is easily accessible on a main road in Mardan, one of the busiest cities in northwest Pakistan.        

The Pakistani Taliban attacked the army&rsquo;s headquarters in Rawalpindi in 2009, and militants have continued to target military and police installations.        

The attack came as the Pakistani Army has asserted that it has made major inroads into militant strongholds in the tribal areas close to Mardan.
