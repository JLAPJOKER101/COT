Thousands of protesters calling for the government to step down marched in several cities on Friday in an outpouring of anger over economic hardship and a lack of democratic reforms.  The protesters, who represented a broad section of the opposition, including the Muslim Brotherhood, left-wing groups and trade unions, demanded that Jordanians be allowed to elect their prime minister and the rest of the cabinet rather than have them appointed by King Abdullah II. The government has tried to defuse the situation by announcing $125 million in subsidies on basic goods and fuel and a pay increase for civil servants.
