Thieves working for at least six months dug a tunnel underneath a bank in Buenos Aires and robbed 143 safety deposit boxes containing an estimated $6.5 million during New Year&rsquo;s weekend, a bank official and prosecutor said. At least three robbers entered Banco de la Provincia in the Belgrano neighborhood on Dec. 31 and left on Jan. 3 at 7 a.m., three hours before the bank reopened after New Year, Mart&iacute;n Niklison, a prosecutor, said on television on Monday. The thieves rented a former dentist&rsquo;s office nearly 100 feet from the bank and then dug a tunnel that ran about 16 feet underground before reaching the basement of the bank. The bank&rsquo;s alarm sounded at least twice during the robbery but the police, lacking keys to the bank, left after not seeing anything from outside the bank, he said.
