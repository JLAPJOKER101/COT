During Apples Q3 earnings call today, the companys CFO Peter Oppenheimer announced that Apple now has 150 Million iCloud users. Thats up from 125 million users the company cited in its last quarterly earnings call in April.As Apple announced at its annual developer conference earlier this year, iCloud will be tightly integrated into Mountain Lion, the next version of OS X thats scheduled to launch tomorrow. Apple sold 26 million iPhones and 17 million iPads in the last quarter, which surely helped to push the number of iCloud users up as well, though the growth in iCloud users is obviously lagging behind the overall growth in the iPhone and iPad ecosystem.The company also announced that it made $1.8 billion in revenue from iTunes (thats from music, movies, TV shows and apps). During its earnings call three months ago, Apple CFO Peter Oppenheimer announced that there were 28 million songs and 45,000 movies available in iTunes. The company did not release any updated numbers for the size of its iTunes music and movie stores today.
