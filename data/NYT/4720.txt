The finance minister, Uhuru Kenyatta, said Wednesday that the government could not afford to hire new teachers as demanded by the thousands who went on strike this week, paralyzing schools in the East African nation. Classrooms have remained shut for more than 10 million students as about 200,000 members of the Kenya National Union of Teachers stayed away.        

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;The union says it wants 28,000 new teachers hired on a permanent basis to cope with a surge in students after President Mwai Kibaki introduced free primary and secondary education. Mr. Kenyatta told Parliament that some of the teachers had agreed to short-term contracts and that he had used most of the spare cash at his disposal to pay higher salaries to the military.
