All of us at TechCrunch recognize that CrunchBase is a hidden gem. As a resource for finding data about startups, funding activity, acquisitions and exits, it is invaluable, as this recent study supports.To keep you up-to-date on the huge stream of data in Crunchbase, we are launching a weekly email digest of the latest startup news and activity called CrunchBase Weekly. Out first edition goes out today at 10am PDT. In this first phase, each weekly email will contain a summary of the top funding rounds, acquisitions, and executive moves in the week past. Over time, we plan on adding more interesting data and analysis.The first newsletter will go out to everyone who has a registered CrunchBase user account with an email address. If you do not have a CrunchBase account and would like to receive this weekly digest, feel free to sign up. And if you receive the newsletter but would rather not, there is a link at the top of the email that allows for a quick unsubscribe.We would love to hear your feedback here or in the comments below. Lastly, while it may seem that we have gone quiet on CrunchBase, we can assure you that is definitely not the case. We are working on a number of things behind the scenes to make CrunchBase an even better and comprehensive source of reliable data. As we build on these ideas, you will see them come to light over the next few months.
