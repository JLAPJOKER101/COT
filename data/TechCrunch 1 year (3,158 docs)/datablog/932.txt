This is a few days old but its well worth revisiting if you havent seen it yet. Its by English rapper Dan Bull and its about everyones favorite time-waster, TheFacebook. The best part?He also does a Twitter one. Give it a listen and then download it for free to help Bull hit the record books.See, Bull is aiming to have the first torrented single in in the UK and global charts so hes giving the tracks away on BitTorrent and asking for a small donation once youre hooked. Its a noble venture and the music, needless to say, is really good and its a wild proof-of-concept for future artists.via BB
