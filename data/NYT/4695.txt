A Palestinian militant in Gaza was killed Tuesday by an attack helicopter after Israeli forces carried out an incursion into Gaza near the southern city of Khan Yunis and clashed with members of a small militant group, shooting at them and receiving mortar fire back, according to the Israeli military and officials of the group, the Popular Resistance Committees. The militant was identified by his group as Khaled Sahmoud, 23. Israeli forces said members of that group carried out the terrorist attack from the Sinai region of Egypt on southern Israel last month that killed eight Israelis.
