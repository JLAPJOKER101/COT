LONDON &mdash; News International, Rupert Murdoch&rsquo;s British newspaper company, knew the practice of phone hacking was widespread at the News of the World newspaper as early as 2008, a lawyer who acted for the company told lawmakers here Wednesday.        

Julian Pike, a partner at the law firm Farrer and Co., said he knew the company&rsquo;s claim that the practice was limited to one &ldquo;rogue reporter,&rdquo; was untrue but admitted that he &ldquo;had not done very much,&rdquo; with the information, as he was not obliged to reveal it. He insisted that he was &ldquo;not party to any cover-up.&rdquo;        

The company eventually admitted to wider wrongdoing early this year, and shuttered the newspaper this summer amid a cascade of revelations. But the company was told in 2008 that three other journalists at the tabloid had been involved, Mr. Pike told a committee of lawmakers gathering evidence on a scandal that continues to pervade a wide swath of British life.&nbsp;        

The committee will take evidence from Mr. Murdoch&rsquo;s former chief lieutenant, Les Hinton, next Monday, and has said it will likely call Mr. Murdoch&rsquo;s son James to give further evidence later this year. Both men face allegations, which they vehemently deny, that they were complicit in covering up phone hacking.
