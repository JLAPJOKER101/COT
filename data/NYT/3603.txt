Fighting erupted between the Mauritanian Army and suspected Islamists in the eastern part of the country on Tuesday, with witnesses reporting heavy weapons fire and aircraft flying overhead. Few details were available about the clash, which came after Al Qaeda&rsquo;s North Africa branch said it had killed 20 Mauritanian soldiers in fighting in Mali last month. Countries in the region are battling an increased threat from gunmen linked to Al Qaeda who frequently cooperate with rebels and bandits.
