Well, this morning seems like its going to be all about sequels. Not only do we have a shiny new Droid Incredible to wait for, AT&T has just pulled back the curtains on a new device in their Focus series of Windows Phones  the LTE-friendly Focus 2, which will launch on May 20 for a mere $49.99 with a two-year contract.The Focus 2 may lack the star power and the marketing muscle behind devices like the Lumia 900, but it has managed to turn a few heads in recent weeks back when it was still known as the Samsung Mandel.Neither AT&T nor Samsung have disclosed some of the juicier technical details, but the Focus 2 sports a 4-inch Super AMOLED display presumably running at the standard 800480 as well a 5-megapixel rear camera and a VGA front-facer.Early reports also pointed out that the device only comes with 8GB of internal memory, though whether or not that little detail has carried over into the final build is still frustratingly unclear. All of that fits nicely into a glossy white body (longtime readers may recall how fond I am of those) that comes in at just under 11mm thick.AT&T aficionados may recall that the Samsung whipped up two Focus Windows Phones last year, the budget-friendly Focus Flash and the slightly-more-robust Focus S. I half-expected AT&T and Samsung to keep that trend going with yet another pair of differently-targeted Windows Phones, but this year AT&T already has those premium bases covered with devices like the Lumia 900 and the HTC Titan II.
