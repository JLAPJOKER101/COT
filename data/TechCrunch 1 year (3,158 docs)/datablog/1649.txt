So its Saturday night and youre out with friend. Are they the inconsiderate jerk who cant stop checking their smartphone? Or is that you?Either way, heres one way to make dinner a little more interesting.Ive seen/heard this described as both The Phone Stacking Game and Dont Be a Dick During Meals. Its been mentioned on a couple of blogs, but a quick  straw poll of my friends suggests that it hasnt become widespread yet, at least on the West Coast. Which is a shame, because its perfect for folks in tech.Heres how it works: At the beginning of the meal, everyone puts their phone face down at the center of the table. As time goes on, youll hear various calls, texts, and emails, but you cant pick up your phone. If youre the first one to give in to temptation, youre buying dinner for everyone else. If no one picks up, then everyone pays for themselves.You can explain the game in a few different ways. Most obviously, it could be a protest against the incessant, unthinking use of cell phones during social gatherings. Or maybe its a game that acknowledges the new reality and tests your willpower accordingly. Personally, I like to think of it as a free market exercise. After all, people love to say, Sorry, but I have to take this. Do you have to answer it? Really? Is it that important to you? Great, then you can pay.No matter what the explanation, it could make for a tense meal. And I look forward to defeating MG Siegler.[image via Kempt]
