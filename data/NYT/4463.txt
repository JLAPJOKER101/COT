Prime Minister Ali Mujawar returned to Yemen on Tuesday after weeks of recuperating in Saudi Arabia from injuries sustained in a deadly attack on the presidential compound in Sana in early June, said a spokesman for Yemen&rsquo;s government, Mohammed Albasha. Mr. Mujawar is the first high-ranking official to return from being treated in Saudi Arabia after the attack, which also wounded President Ali Abdullah Saleh and a handful of other high-ranking officials.        

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; Mr. Mujawar&rsquo;s return comes one day after another high-level official injured in the attack died in Riyadh. Abdel Aziz Abdul-Ghani, former head of the Shura Council, died on Monday, according to state-run media. Mr. Saleh remains in Saudi Arabia and vows that he will return to Yemen.
