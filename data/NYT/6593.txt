A long-awaited contingent of soldiers from Djibouti arrived in Mogadishu, Somalia&rsquo;s capital, on Tuesday to join the African Union peacekeeping force. After a few hours of confusion about where the Djiboutians would be based, about 200 soldiers wearing helmets and flak jackets marched off the plane and headed to a camp along the ocean. Djibouti had promised for years to send peacekeepers to Somalia. It is the third country to contribute combat units, along with Uganda and Burundi. Djiboutian officials say they expect to send several hundred more troops in the coming months. The total African Union force is now about 10,000 soldiers.
