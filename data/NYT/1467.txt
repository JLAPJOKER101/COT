CAIRO &mdash; The governing military council in Egypt released the younger brother of Ayman al-Zawahri, Al Qaeda&rsquo;s second in command, from prison on Thursday after detaining him for a decade on charges of conspiracy to overthrow the government, his lawyer said.        

The brother, Mohammed al-Zawahri, was extradited to Egypt in 2000 from the United Arab Emirates, where he had been in hiding, and had been in Tora Prison in Cairo since then. Security officials said he was the head of the Special Action Committee of Islamic Jihad, which organized terrorist operations.        

Mr. Zawahri was one of 59 political detainees released Thursday by the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, the military-led transitional government, security officials said.        

Since taking power after President Hosni Mubarak was toppled on Feb. 11, the Supreme Council has released 1,659 prisoners, security officials said. Of those, 904 were held on criminal charges and 755 were political prisoners.        

Mr. Zawahri, who is in his 50s, is the latest high-profile Islamist to be freed. Last Friday, the government released Abboud and Tareq al-Zomor, two Islamic Jihad leaders imprisoned in connection with the 1981 assassination of President Anwar el-Sadat.        

Mr. Zawahri&rsquo;s lawyer, Nizar al-Ghurab, said his client was held primarily to &ldquo;extract information from him about his brother.&rdquo; He accused the authorities of torturing Mr. Zawahri during his 10-year incarceration.        

&ldquo;Of course, his brother was a main reason for his detention,&rdquo; Mr. Ghurab said. &ldquo;He might have been harmed because of his brother.&rdquo;
