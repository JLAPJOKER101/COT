Myanmar&rsquo;s first Parliament in more than two decades nominated five candidates on Tuesday, one of whom will become president and lead the new military-dominated government. The army has held power since 1962 and is now essentially handpicking the country&rsquo;s president. Through representatives of its party and their allies, it holds an 80 percent majority in the new legislature, so the new leader is certain to be a top member of the departing junta. The country&rsquo;s ruler for the last 18 years, Senior Gen. Than Shwe, was not one of the nominees. The most prominent person vying for the presidency and the three vice presidents seats is Gen. Thein Sein, who served as prime minister in the junta. A vote is expected Thursday.
