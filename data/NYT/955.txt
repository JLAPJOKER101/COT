CIUDAD JU&Aacute;REZ, Mexico (AP) &mdash; A shoot-&rsquo;em-up video game set in the border town of Ciudad Ju&aacute;rez has angered local officials who are busy fighting all-too-real violence.        

Chihuahua state legislators said Sunday that they have asked federal authorities to ban &ldquo;Call of Juarez: The Cartel,&rdquo; which is based on drug cartel shootouts in Ciudad Ju&aacute;rez. About 6,000 people died in drug-related violence in Ciudad Ju&aacute;rez, across the United States border from El Paso, in 2009 and 2010.        

The Web site of the game developer Ubisoft Entertainment says the title is scheduled for release this summer. Screen shots from the game show three characters armed with a pistol, an assault rifle and a shotgun ready to open fire on a city street.        

No one answered a message left at the company&rsquo;s San Francisco office.        

Ricardo Boone Salmon, a congressman for Chihuahua State, where Ciudad Ju&aacute;rez is located, said the state legislature unanimously approved a request asking the federal Interior Department to ban the game.        

&ldquo;It is true there is a serious crime situation, which we are not trying to hide,&rdquo; Mr. Boone Salmon said. &ldquo;But we also should not expose children to this kind of scenario so that they are going to grow up with this kind of image and lack of values.&rdquo;
