The confessed killer of the governor of Punjab Province was charged with murder on Monday in an antiterrorism court in Rawalpindi. The man, Mumtaz Qadri, said he shot Gov. Salman Taseer in January while serving as one of his bodyguards because the governor opposed blasphemy laws that impose the death sentence for insulting Islam. When asked by the judge if he intentionally killed Mr. Taseer, Mr. Qadri said that he did not consider his actions illegal and that he had dealt with &ldquo;an apostate&rdquo; as required under Islamic law, his lawyer said. Lawyers on both sides said the statement was equivalent to a guilty plea.
