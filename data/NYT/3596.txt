The European Union banned imports of some seeds and beans from Egypt on Tuesday after investigators said a single shipment of fenugreek seeds from there was the most likely source of a highly toxic E. coli epidemic that has killed 49 people. The ban will last until Oct. 31, said the European Union&rsquo;s health commissioner, John Dalli. It covers imports of legumes, fenugreek and soybeans.
