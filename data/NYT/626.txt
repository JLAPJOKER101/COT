A court found a Somali man guilty of terrorism for using an ax to break into the home of a Danish cartoonist who had caricatured the Prophet Muhammad. The defendant, 29, entered the home of the cartoonist, Kurt Westergaard, in Aarhus last year. Mr. Westergaard, 75, who was unharmed, had drawn one of 12 cartoons published by a Danish newspaper in 2005 that set off violent protests around the Muslim world. Sentencing is expected Friday.
