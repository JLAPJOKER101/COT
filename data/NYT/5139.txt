MOSCOW &mdash; President Dmitri A. Medvedev of Russia explained in a television interview shown on Friday that he had decided to step aside and allow Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin to return to the presidency because Mr. Putin is more popular.        

&ldquo;There remains a fairly high level of trust to the current president,&rdquo; said Mr. Medvedev, referring to himself in the third person. &ldquo;But on the other hand, I would like to turn your attention to the fact that, at the moment, Prime Minister Putin is the most authoritative politician in our country, and his approval ratings are somewhat higher.        

&ldquo;For some reason, nobody is talking about that,&rdquo; Mr. Medvedev said, in an interview taped Thursday, which aired Friday evening on Russian television. &ldquo;But in fact this is a very practical and very important thing which any politician must take into account, if he wants to serve the good of his country and not just jockey for position.&rdquo;        

Mr. Medvedev announced last week that Mr. Putin would run for the presidency, a post that he held from 2000 to 2008 and can now occupy until 2024. In what Russians describe, with a chess term, as a &ldquo;castling move,&rdquo; Mr. Medvedev will take Mr. Putin&rsquo;s job as prime minister. Both Mr. Putin and his party, United Russia, are assured of winning, in a political environment that is largely under Kremlin control.        

The announcement has not gone smoothly. Hours after the decision was made public, Finance Minister Aleksei L. Kudrin &mdash; one of Mr. Putin&rsquo;s most trusted and respected aides &mdash; said he would refuse to serve under Mr. Medvedev. He was fired the next day in a televised meeting. Meanwhile, Mr. Medvedev, who now leads the party slate for United Russia, apparently feels pressure to make sure people turn up to vote.        

&ldquo;The choice is made by the people &mdash; these are not empty words, this is absolutely so,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Only people, only our citizens are capable of determining the final accents, by voting for this or that person or this or that political force, or otherwise rejecting them. This is what democracy is.&rdquo;        

He condemned calls to boycott elections, which are already circulating among opposition-minded Russians, as &ldquo;irresponsible, cunning and even provocative.&rdquo;        

Political observers spent much of the year speculating about what factors would drive the choice between Mr. Putin and Mr. Medvedev, and Mr. Medvedev did shed some light on the question.        

Mr. Putin&rsquo;s popularity, which soared a decade ago against the backdrop of war with Chechen separatists, is seen by insiders as central to the survival of Russia&rsquo;s political system. Though the Kremlin has some ability to manipulate ratings via television coverage, the government also spends lavishly to gather public opinion data and uses it to guide policy making.        

Mr. Medvedev said he and Mr. Putin long ago reached an agreement about succession, but were waiting to see &ldquo;if voters&rsquo; preferences changed for some reason,&rdquo; which is why he repeatedly said that no decision had been made. He also said that as members of the same political team, he and Mr. Putin could not engage in direct competition, offering an example from American politics.        

&ldquo;Can you imagine if, for instance, Barack Obama started to compete with Hillary Clinton?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I remind you that they were both candidates for the post of the president. Well, it&rsquo;s impossible for you to imagine this! They&rsquo;re both from the Democratic Party, so they made a decision based on who was capable of bringing the best result. We made the same kind of decision.&rdquo;        

Mr. Medvedev&rsquo;s remarks did little to soothe the frustration of liberal commentators, some of whom had invested hopes in him as a proponent of reform.        

Aleksei A. Venediktov, the editor in chief of the Ekho Moskvy radio station, was scathing about the example of the 2008 Democratic primary race, noting that Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton held televised debates, and that though Mrs. Clinton held the lead in polls and early primaries, the party did not simply &ldquo;make a decision&rdquo; based on those factors.        

&ldquo;Who told you such a stupid thing, that you decided to repeat to the whole world?&rdquo; he wrote. &ldquo;How sad this is.&rdquo;        

Mr. Medvedev&rsquo;s approval ratings have tracked closely with his mentor&rsquo;s, generally a few points down. Gleb O. Pavlovsky, a longtime political consultant to the Kremlin whose contract was discontinued this spring, said the two men were supported by the same set of voters, and the difference between them was so small that at times this summer it fell within the margin of error.        

&ldquo;There is no reason to pay much attention to this kind of explanation,&rdquo; Mr. Pavlovsky said. &ldquo;It just confirms the suspicion that in the previous weeks, something happened which we do not know about.&rdquo;        

Mr. Medvedev&rsquo;s interview, Mr. Pavlovsky said, offers only a &ldquo;very vague explanation,&rdquo; as well as an &ldquo;explanation of his previous explanation.        

&ldquo;He missed a very good opportunity to remain silent,&rdquo; he said.        

Meanwhile Igor Y. Yurgens, one of Mr. Medvedev&rsquo;s advisers, said the outcome could have been different if liberals and businessmen had been willing to openly support him. He described an &ldquo;important meeting of entrepreneurs&rdquo; at which Mr. Medvedev urged the group to make a choice and was met with blank stares.        

&ldquo;There was a mute scene as in &lsquo;The Inspector General,&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; a play by Nikolai Gogol whose final act shows a roomful of people shocked into silence, he said in an interview with the Web site Gazeta.ru. &ldquo;Nothing more. But then what &mdash; well, they got what they wanted.&rdquo;
