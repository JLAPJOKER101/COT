Haiti will not be able to hold a runoff election for president before February as it awaits a report from experts at the Organization of American States who are reviewing the controversial results of the first round of voting, a senior electoral official said Tuesday. The final outcome of the November election has remained in question since violent protests greeted the preliminary results and verified cases of fraud and disenfranchisement have surfaced. The original electoral timetable had called for final first-round results to be announced on Dec. 20 and a runoff to be held on Jan. 16.  Pierre-Louis Opont, director general of Haiti&rsquo;s Provisional Electoral Council, said the country would need at least one month from the announcement of the final results of the first round before it could hold a second round.
