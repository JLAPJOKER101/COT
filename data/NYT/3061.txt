Dozens of doctors and nurses who treated injured antigovernment protesters during the months of unrest in Bahrain went on trial on Monday on charges that they had participated in efforts to overthrow the monarchy. The 47 health professionals were arraigned in a closed hearing in a security court. The Shiite majority had been protesting to demand greater freedom, equal rights and an elected government from the Sunni monarchy. During the unrest, the medical professionals said it was their duty to treat everyone and rejected accusations that treating protesters was akin to supporting their cause.
