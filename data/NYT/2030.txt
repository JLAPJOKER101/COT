Germany&rsquo;s Parliament says its human rights committee is protesting the conditions in which a United States Army private suspected of giving classified material to WikiLeaks is being detained. A statement from Parliament&rsquo;s lower house on Wednesday said that committee members appealed in a letter to President Obama for him to ensure &ldquo;humane&rdquo; conditions for Pfc. Bradley E. Manning. Private Manning&rsquo;s defense lawyer has complained that his client is being held under unjustifiably restrictive conditions, including being largely isolated in his cell 23 hours a day and being stripped of his clothing each night and given a suicide-proof smock to wear to bed.
