MEXICO CITY &mdash; The once thriving resort area of Acapulco suffered another blow on Saturday with the discovery of 28 bodies, 15 of them headless, from a round of assaults overnight that bore the earmarks of organized crime.        

Unlike many other tourist areas, Acapulco sits in a Pacific Coast state hotly contested by at least three drug-trafficking organizations and has paid the price with a rash of grisly killings in recent years and a sharp decline in foreign tourists.        

The authorities in Guerrero State said the decapitated bodies, with the heads scattered around them, belonged to men in their 20s. They were found shortly before 1 a.m. outside the Plaza Sendero shopping center, an area not frequented by tourists,  near two messages apparently left by a drug-trafficking organization.        

Beheading is  a common tactic among warring drug organizations. In 2008, nine decapitated bodies were found in a pile outside Guerrero&rsquo;s capital, Chilpancingo, north of Acapulco.        

The other bodies, from killings that stretched from Friday night to early Saturday morning, include six found in a taxi behind a supermarket, four riddled with bullets in two residential neighborhoods and three others in other locations.        

Gory crime in resort areas is an especially delicate issue with promoters of the multibillion-dollar  tourism industry here. Most drug-related violence, which has killed more than 30,000 people since 2006, occurs in a handful of states, particularly along the United States-Mexico border.        

Acapulco, a city once synonymous with beach tourism, has sought to revive its fortunes as a destination for Mexicans. The tourist areas near the beachfront hotels are heavily patrolled by the police.        

But a wave of anxiety hit in November when the bodies of 18 men, abducted  as they arrived for what their families said was an Acapulco vacation, were found in a mass grave outside the city.
