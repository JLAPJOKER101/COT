It looks like Amazon Web Services may be launching a new workflow manager called SWF. First spotted by TechCrunch reader Michael Hood, SWF is listed as a service under AWS Free Usage Tier. Unfortunately, clicking on SWF takes you to a 404 page.Upon further digging, it looks like SWF stands for Amazon Simple Workflow Service. It basically starts, runs, and retains workflow executions, as well as schedules tasks, adds markers, receives signals, and starts timers for those workflow executions. According to the information listed, with the free usage tier, 1,000 Amazon SWF executions can be initiated for free. A total of 10,000 activity tasks, signals, timers and markers and 30,000 workflow-days can also be used for free.Amazons free usage tier allows users to run a free Amazon EC2 Micro Instance for a year, and use Amazon S3, Amazon Elastic Block Store, Amazon Elastic Load Balancing, and AWS data transfer for free as well. AWSâ€™s free usage tier can be used to run an application in the cloud, including launching new applications, testing existing applications in the cloud, or more. SWF would be included for free in this package. Obviously, with so little information, its hard to determine the exact details of what SWF does or who it will compete with at this point, but it appears to be new. Weve reached out to Amazon for comment and will update when we hear back. Update: Amazon has taken all mentions of SWF off of the AWS Free Usage Tier Site; and has yet to comment. Weve embedded screenshots below:
