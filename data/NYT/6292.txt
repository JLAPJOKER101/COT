Activists from the environmental group Greenpeace infiltrated two nuclear power plants on Monday, and breached or tried to breach security at least two other nuclear sites, authorities said. Nine activists were arrested at a site in Nogent-sur-Seine, southeast of Paris, and two in Cruas, in the south. Greenpeace called security measures at the plants &ldquo;insufficient,&rdquo; and called for French leaders to shut down the country&rsquo;s 58 nuclear reactors, which account for more than three quarters of the electricity consumed in France. French officials acknowledged a need to reinforce security around nuclear facilities.
