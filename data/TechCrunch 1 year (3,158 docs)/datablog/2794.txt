Im sitting here at Facebooks F8 conference with Spotify CEO Daniel Ek and hes just told me that Spotify will no longer be invite-only in the US, and that the service will have no limitations (essentially be free) for an unpaid users first six months using the service  the clock will start ticking, and be retroactive, after a user signs up.This six months leeway will be available both internationally and in the US.The service is slowly rolling out the new features, so it might take a little time for invites to drop completely says Spotify community manager Andres Sehr. Users will need Facebook to bypass the invite system.For music to be inherently social it needs to be an open model, and thats why we decided to do it today, says Spotify representative Angela Watts. After the allotted six months have passed, music you encounter on Facebook will count towards your monthly Spotify limit, as you have to go through the Spotify app to listen to it.Spotifys tiered plans include a free version, which allows you to listen to up to ten hours free monthly, a $4.99 unlimited version which drops ads and $9.99 premium version which gives you unlimited mobile access in offline mode. Paid users will continue to enjoy the service they have, says Sehr.
