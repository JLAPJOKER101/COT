At least 15 people were killed Monday and another 30 wounded after government forces clashed with each other in Mogadishu, witnesses said. The shooting started when a government soldier tried to enter a hospital with a gun and was repelled by government security guards. A fierce firefight erupted, which killed soldiers and civilians in a nearby market.
