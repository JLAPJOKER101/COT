Prosecutors have opened an investigation into a report that two Italian men tried to bribe a Moroccan official to falsify the birth records of a teenager whom Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi is accused of having paid for sex. Mr. Berlusconi has been charged with paying Karima el-Mahroug for sex last year when she was under 18, and with intervening with the police to cover up his connection with her. Mr. Berlusconi denies the charges. An Italian newspaper, Il Fatto Quotidiano, reported that two Italian men offered a registry official in Fkih Ben Salah, Morocco, thousands of euros to change Ms. Mahroug&rsquo;s birth date to 1990 instead of 1992.
