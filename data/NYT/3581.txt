Japan&rsquo;s new disaster reconstruction minister submitted his resignation on Tuesday after making remarks that were widely criticized as offensive. During a visit to the country&rsquo;s earthquake-devastated northeast coast over the weekend, the minister, Ryu Matsumoto, refused to shake a governor&rsquo;s hand, scolding the official and threatening to withhold aid. After dressing down the governor, Yoshihiro Murai, Mr. Matsumoto warned journalists in the room not to report his words. They were widely reported in the media.
