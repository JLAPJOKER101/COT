ArtSpotters new iPhone app has just gone live in the App store and if you like art you should check it out. Its an interactive art map that lets you discover art around you and add to the map. This is version one, but the next one will allow sharing on Facebook and Twitter. Think Foursquare meets Timeout for art. Venues can get data on what people are doing via the app.
