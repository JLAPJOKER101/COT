Two competitors at the World Scrabble Championships in Warsaw were asked to empty their pockets when a &ldquo;G&rdquo; tile disappeared. The contestants, Edward Martin from Britain and Chollapat Itthi-Aree from Thailand, noticed a missing tile, which led to a search of the area that included asking the players to show the contents of their pockets. The missing letter was nowhere to be found, so the referee added another &ldquo;G&rdquo; tile to the set.
