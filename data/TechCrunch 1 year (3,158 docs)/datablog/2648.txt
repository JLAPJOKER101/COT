Streaming music service Grooveshark is today announcing it has signed new licensing deals with worldwide distribution network DashGo and indie label NuGroove Records. DashGo is the larger deal, representing 115 labels, more than 4,5000 banks and over 50,000 tracks. NuGroove, meanwhile, is a small label with just over two dozen signed artists.DashGos top labels include Delicious Vinyl and Time Records, and its top bands are Coconut Records and Rock Mafia. NuGroove is more jazz-focused, with acts like Michael Lington and Bob Baldwin.Grooveshark now has a library of over 15 million songs and sees over 35 million unique visitors monthly. However, its questionably legal service has resulted in its app getting rejected by Apple and even banned by the Android Market in the past. Its now available as an app for jailbroken iPhones and via the mobile Web at m.grooveshark.com.Full mobile access is available for $9/month, which is an increasingly hard sell when for just a buck more you can get still large, but legal, catalogs from MOG (12M), Rdio (12M) or Rhapsody (13M), for example.That said, Groovesharks fans love the selection, the apps design and offline access the service provides via its apps and websites. And considering its issues, growing to 35 million uniques per month is rather impressive.Update: As is typical, Grooveshark PR immediately (and repeatedly) emailed us to correct the part where we call the service questionably legal. Analysis has been done to death on this one, so well just link out to TechDirts smart take on the situation.
