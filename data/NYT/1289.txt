AJDABIYA, Libya &mdash; A short walk from the morgue, men gathered at noon Wednesday before a billboard that read &ldquo;Free Libya&rdquo; and listed the dead and wounded in the fighting that had raged for days a couple of hours away along the Mediterranean. No. 15 was Mahmoud Abdel-Hamid, from Benghazi. No. 43 was Ibrahim el-Sharif, from Ajdabiya.        

&ldquo;These are the new names,&rdquo; one man said, pointing at the board.        

Some looked for friends, others relatives. A few were curious about whether they knew anyone. Osama Moghrabi simply nodded in recognition. &ldquo;More will have to die,&rdquo; he said.        

At Ajdabiya Hospital, a low-slung affair trimmed in cream and salmon, the guns have fallen silent, save for an occasional volley in the distance. Left to reckon with the aftermath are doctors who have volunteered from abroad, nurses who have traveled here from the rest of opposition-held Libya and what remains of the hospital&rsquo;s staff, thrust into the middle of a protest that became an uprising and an uprising that has become a war.        

The conflict here feels anarchic, even bewildering, like a prisoner liberated from a cell and squinting into the sun. In the chaos, where men in mismatched uniforms amble around town with rifles, and pickups careen through streets with machine guns mounted in back, the hospital offers another narrative: the commitment to see a country through this trial.        

In stretches of calm punctuated by drama, there is the fervor of the quiet.        

&ldquo;I never thought I would come here this way,&rdquo; said Dr. Rida Mazagri, a soft-spoken volunteer neurosurgeon from Charleston, W.Va., who arrived two weeks ago. &ldquo;But we have been waiting for 30 years for a spark. We&rsquo;re not going to let it extinguish. Either he leaves or he finishes all of us. This land does not accept both of us here.&rdquo;        

Dr. Mazagri said he felt helpless as he watched the war from afar, a once-disdainful expatriate who no longer felt estranged from his native country. After days of watching television, he had had enough. &ldquo;&nbsp;&lsquo;Change the call schedule,&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; he recalled telling his colleagues at the hospital. &ldquo;&nbsp;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m leaving. When I&rsquo;m going to come back, I have no idea.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;        

He booked a ticket that took him to Atlanta, Rome and Cairo, then went overland across a border that had crumbled to Benghazi, the capital of opposition-held Libya.        

&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like a member of your family is ill and they might die without you saying goodbye,&rdquo; said the doctor, 50, who grew up in Tripoli but left 23 years ago.        

Doctors here say 100 volunteers have joined him, from the United States, Egypt and South Africa, as well as from towns stretching from Benghazi to the Green Mountain region to Tobruk in the east. Aid organizations have sent supplies from Egypt and Qatar, and relief workers have managed to recover the dead and wounded from a mercurial battlefield where they said government troops seized two of their own this week.        

The staff takes pride in an oasis of organization in a region without it.        

&ldquo;It functions,&rdquo; said Dr. Walid Saad, a surgeon who was scheduled to begin training in the United States this summer. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not like the cities, where there are no police. It&rsquo;s not like the rest of the country, where there are no more structures of government.&rdquo;        

As in much of Libya these days, rumors were volunteered as freely as predictions of the war&rsquo;s imminent end &mdash; two days, a week, no longer. One doctor heard that Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi was headed on a personal jet to Greece, then Egypt. Another insisted that the government had deprived reluctant pilots of parachutes to stop them from deserting.        

In the cafeteria, an Arabic satellite channel blared the latest from the front. Residents of besieged Zawiyah, a town near Tripoli, appealed for medical aid. A frantic witness in Ras Lanuf shouted inaudibly to an announcer about government attacks.        

&ldquo;Can you hear me, Mr. Muhammad?&rdquo; the anchor pleaded.        

&ldquo;It&rsquo;s crazy, crazy,&rdquo; Dr. Omar Ali said as he watched. &ldquo;The inhumanity.&rdquo;        

The Ajdabiya Hospital is not the region&rsquo;s best. One in Benghazi is far larger, far better equipped. Ajdabiya is farther from the front line than a smaller hospital in Ras Lanuf, but doctors have had to evacuate it at times, as fighting neared. That leaves Ajdabiya as the place where the wounded come first, and it bears the scars of three weeks of fighting.

Six rickety caskets, belonging to the Bab al-Salam Mosque, sat outside the morgue, next to an olive tree. The lid of one was scabbed with dried blood. Under a pallid gray sky, a pool of rainwater turned red gathered in another. Slogans crowded nearby walls. &ldquo;No to tribalism, no to East and no to West, Libya is one tribe,&rdquo; one read.        

The hospital&rsquo;s parking lot felt like the whirlwinds that gather in the desert outside &mdash; force without direction. Relief vehicles barreled into the compound, in cinematic scenes of a post-apocalypse. &ldquo;Free Libya&rdquo; was scrawled on the hood of one by hand. Soldiers walked around in every version of camouflage: tan, green and an odd dark blue. Occasionally, a car pulled up to drop off another wounded fighter. At 5:30 p.m., it was a shivering Hassan Adam Mohammed, whose left eye was swollen shut by an explosion.        

&ldquo;He maybe lost it,&rdquo; said Dr. Wanis Obeidi, who was treating him.        

He surveyed the room, where each casualty seemed to harden the resolve of the staff. Since the uprising began, he has worked in Darnah, Bayda, Benghazi and now here.        

&ldquo;Where they go, I&rsquo;ll go,&rdquo; he said of the fighters.        

Upstairs was Ibrahim el-Sharif, No. 43 on the list. After eight operations for a gunshot wound, his left leg still wasn&rsquo;t right, blood leaking through the soiled bandages.        

&ldquo;No regrets,&rdquo; he said.        

Next door was Mamhoud Abdel-Hamid, No. 15, wiry and looking much younger than his 25 years. He faded in and out of consciousness as his father, Abdel-Hamid Humaiti, entered. He leaned down to kiss his son&rsquo;s forehead, then looked away.        

&ldquo;If he wants to go back, I&rsquo;ll let him go,&rdquo; his father said loud enough for his son to hear. He repeated the words, a little more vehemently, before stepping out of earshot.        

Much of his son&rsquo;s right hand was amputated, he whispered, shaking his head.        

&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not able to fight anymore,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
