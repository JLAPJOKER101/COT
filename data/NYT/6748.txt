Iran A senior commander of Iran&rsquo;s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps said on Thursday that the United States was not in a position to tell Iran &ldquo;what to do in the Strait of Hormuz,&rdquo; state television reported. Earlier in the week, Iran delivered a sharp threat in response to economic sanctions being prepared by the United States, saying it would retaliate against any crackdown by blocking all oil shipments through Hormuz, a vital artery for transporting about one-fifth of the world&rsquo;s oil supply. The United States responded on Wednesday by saying the Navy&rsquo;s Fifth Fleet would not allow any disruption to shipping in the gulf.
