Offers are a booming form of advertising in which consumers are presented with offers to try or buy products. It is particularly popular in social games where players receive virtual currency in return for looking at the offers. One of the leaders in this form of ecommerce advertising is TrialPay, which just raised $40 million from Greylock Partners, Visa, T. Rowe Price, DAG Ventures, DFJ Growth and QuestMark Partners.  The series C round brings TrialPays total funding to $56 million. Visas involvement in the round is significant in that its other major venture investment is in Square. As alternative forms of payment appear and gain traction, Visa wants to keep tabs on them.TrialPays offers reach 70 million active users a month around the world, and the amount of transactions flowing through its platform increased sevenfold last year (although the company does not say from what base). It is one of the partners that powers offers for Facebook Credits.
