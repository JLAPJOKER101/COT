European rabbis urged the Vatican on Wednesday to stop any attempts to reconcile with a group of&nbsp;ultra-traditionalist Catholics, the Society of St. Pius X, until the movement pledges to renounce members who the rabbis say are anti-Semitic. The Conference of European Rabbis said Bishop Richard Williamson, already known for publicly denying the scope of the Holocaust, was one of two members who recently revived the age-old accusation that Jews killed Jesus. The Roman Catholic Church said at the Second Vatican Council that it did not hold Jews responsible for killing Jesus.
