NEW DELHI &mdash; An Indian court sentenced 11 people to death on Tuesday for the burning of a passenger train in 2002 that killed 59 Hindu pilgrims and set off bloody communal riots that swept across the state of Gujarat. Twenty other defendants received life sentences.        

Hindus, seeking revenge for the burning of the train, attacked Muslim households and businesses in riots that left about 1,000 people dead in one of India&rsquo;s most searing episodes of religious violence.        

Last month, an Indian court convicted 31 people in the train case but acquitted 63 who had spent almost nine years in jail. Among the acquitted was the man accused of being the ringleader of the attack, Maulana Umarji. A special inquiry appointed by the state government concluded in 2008 that the burning of the train was a conspiracy.        

J. M. Panchal, a prosecutor, said after the sentencing that the court &ldquo;considered this case as the rarest of the rare cases of conspiracy and killing.&rdquo; He said he was still waiting for a complete copy of the 900-page verdict so he could understand why the court sentenced certain defendants to death and others to life in prison.        

Defense lawyers disputed the ruling. &ldquo;The prosecution changed the conspiracy theory twice, and that is enough ground to challenge the verdict,&rdquo; said one lawyer, I. M. Munshi.        

Prosecutors initially argued that flammable material was thrown into the train. But later, they changed their argument, saying that the incendiary material was thrown from inside.
