People suspected of being gang members killed 39 people in two days in Karachi, Pakistan&rsquo;s largest city, with many of the victims tortured, shot and stuffed in sacks that were dumped on the streets, officials said Thursday. The gangs are said to be affiliated with the city&rsquo;s main political parties and have been blamed for a surge in killings in recent months. The latest round of violence seemed to be driven by a mix of political and criminal motivations, said Sharfuddin Memon, the security adviser to the government in Sindh Province, where Karachi is located. The recent violence came after the Muttahida Qaumi Movement left the federal coalition led by the Pakistan Peoples Party in late June and joined the opposition.
