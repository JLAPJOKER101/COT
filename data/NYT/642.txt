A suspect who confessed to the killing of David Kato, a prominent gay-rights activist, said it was unrelated to Mr. Kato&rsquo;s activism, the police said Thursday. The suspect, Enock Nsubuga, 22, said Mr. Kato had reneged on a promise to pay Mr. Nsubuga for sex, officials said. Mr. Kato, left, had received numerous death threats because of his work. Parliament is considering a bill that would call for gays to be executed under certain circumstances, and a newspaper had published photos of Mr. Kato and other activists on the front page under the headline &ldquo;Hang Them.&rdquo; Mr. Kato was beaten to death in his home last week.
