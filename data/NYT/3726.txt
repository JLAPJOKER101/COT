PARIS &mdash; Lawmakers here on Tuesday reauthorized France&rsquo;s participation in the NATO-led bombing campaign in Libya against the forces of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, while French officials said they were increasingly optimistic about the possibility of a negotiated end to the conflict.        

&ldquo;A political solution in Libya is more indispensable than ever and it is beginning to take shape,&rdquo; Prime Minister Fran&ccedil;ois Fillon told lawmakers before the vote. He offered no details, except to say that such a solution would depend upon an &ldquo;authentic and verifiable&rdquo; cease-fire and &ldquo;the departure of Colonel Qaddafi from power.&rdquo;        

After four months of French airstrikes and patrols over Libya under NATO&rsquo;s auspices, the government was constitutionally bound to seek parliamentary approval to prolong military operations in the country. The lower house voted 482 to 27 in favor of continuing operations, with 7 abstentions. The Senate later voted overwhelmingly in favor.        

While popular approval of French military involvement in Libya has waned somewhat since March, when President Nicolas Sarkozy led the charge for an intervention, about 50 percent remain supportive, according to opinion polls.        

Earlier Tuesday, Foreign Minister Alain Jupp&eacute; described what he called a &ldquo;consensus on how to end the crisis&rdquo; among NATO states as well as the African Union, which has said it would broker talks between Colonel Qaddafi and the rebels fighting his rule.        

&ldquo;Ending the crisis entails the departure of Qaddafi from power,&rdquo; Mr. Jupp&eacute; told France Info radio. &ldquo;This was absolutely not a given two or three months ago.&rdquo;        

&ldquo;The question is no longer to know if Qaddafi must leave, but when and how,&rdquo; he added. Representatives sent by Colonel Qaddafi have indicated that &ldquo;Qaddafi is ready to leave&rdquo; and have called for negotiations, Mr. Jupp&eacute; said, but he denied a claim that those negotiations might directly involve France.        

In an interview Monday in the Algerian newspaper El Khabar, Seif al-Islam el-Qaddafi, Colonel Qaddafi&rsquo;s powerful second-eldest son, said the government was holding &ldquo;real negotiations with France and not with the rebels.&rdquo;        

Mr. Jupp&eacute; acknowledged French contact with Qaddafi &ldquo;emissaries&rdquo; sent to Paris and other European capitals.        

President Sarkozy met with Colonel Qaddafi&rsquo;s chief of staff, Bashir Saleh, one month ago, Le Monde reported Tuesday. The presidential office declined to comment on the report.        

Colonel Qaddafi has repeatedly said he would not leave Libya under any circumstance.
