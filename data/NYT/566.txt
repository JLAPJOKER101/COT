Iran has summoned an American woman to return to the country and stand trial on Feb. 6 along with two other Americans still in custody and accused of spying after crossing the border from Iraq, a judiciary spokesman said Monday. The Americans said they were hiking in northern Iraq and crossed the border inadvertently when they were arrested in 2009. The woman, Sarah Shourd, who was released on bail in September and returned to the United States, did not comment publicly on the summons.
