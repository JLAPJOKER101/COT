The Foreign Ministry rebuked authorities in Georgia on Monday for violating their citizens&rsquo; &ldquo;rights to the freedom of assembly and expression of opinions&rdquo; because the police dispersed an opposition protest over the weekend. The statement left out any comparison to Russia&rsquo;s own treatment of opposition protesters, who are routinely arrested, but did note the police action in Georgia could be interpreted as violating a European human rights convention.
