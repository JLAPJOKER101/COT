President Obama named the veteran diplomat Princeton Lyman to be his new special envoy to Sudan. Mr. Lyman, a former ambassador to Nigeria and South Africa, was called out of retirement last year to help mediate disputes between northern and southern Sudan before the south&rsquo;s secession vote in January. Now, Mr. Lyman will try to ease southern Sudan&rsquo;s transition to independence while trying to improve relations with the Sudanese government in Khartoum. He succeeds Gen. Scott Gration, who stepped down in February to be nominated for the Kenya ambassador post.
