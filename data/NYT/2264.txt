EL ARISH, Egypt (AP) &mdash; An explosion rocked a natural gas terminal in North Sinai near Egypt&rsquo;s border with Israel on Wednesday, sending flames shooting into the air and forcing the country&rsquo;s export pipeline to shut down, security officials said.        

The explosion occurred at the Al Sabil terminal near El Arish, a town 30 miles from the border with Israel. On March 27, gunmen planted explosives at the terminal, but they failed to detonate.        

The valves controlling the flow of gas from the main terminal in Port Said on the Mediterranean coast were shut down to stifle the flames, which sent residents fleeing from their homes. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press.
