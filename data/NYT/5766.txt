The government said Thursday that it would close its embassy to the Vatican, but Deputy Prime Minister Eamon Gilmore said the decision was made on &ldquo;purely economic grounds&rdquo; and not as a result of a rift with the Holy See over the handling of allegations of child sexual abuse. Mr. Gilmore said &ldquo;recent controversies&rdquo; had no bearing on the decision, citing the government&rsquo;s need to reduce expenses under the terms of a European Union bailout package. The government is also closing embassies in East Timor and Iran, he said. The Vatican withdrew its ambassador to Ireland in July after an Irish government report said the Vatican had discouraged bishops from reporting cases of sexual abuse to the police, a charge the Vatican rejects. The Vatican said Thursday that every state was &ldquo;free to decide&rdquo; whether or not to have an envoy in Rome, but what counts are diplomatic relations, &ldquo;and these are not in question with regards to Ireland.&rdquo;
