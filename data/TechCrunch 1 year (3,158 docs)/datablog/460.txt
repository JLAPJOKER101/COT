If 2012 turns out to be the year when the online privacy economy really takes off, then the private social network, EveryMe is likely to become one of the big new stories in Silicon Valley. Formed a year ago in Menlo Park out of the Y Combinator stable, EveryMe now boasts $1.5 million in start-up capital and over 500,000 users of its circles (heard that one before, eh?) product which is available as both Android and iPhone apps. As co-founder Vibhu Norby told me when he came into our San Francisco studio, EveryMe was originally founded as an address book company but pivoted to a private social network when it became obvious that the world was waking up to the problems of online privacy.We do not sell data to advertisers, Norby boldly told me.You cant get any more explicit than that.WE DO NOT SELL DATA TO ADVERTISERSThats EveryMes core idea. And so privacy, Norby explained, is built into the ethos of the EveryMe product. There is, therefore, no public sharing at all on EveryMe. And thats because, he explained to me, content is more valued when its private. Norby claims that EveryMe is changing the way in which advertisers are working with social networks by challenging them not to exploit private data. Brave words.Â  Lets hope that users agree with Norby that privacy is, indeed, better and make EveryMe one of Silicon Valleys poster children of the growing backlash against Facebook.
