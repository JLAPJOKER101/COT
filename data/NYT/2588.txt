Security forces have detained a woman believed to be at the center of a riot between Muslim and Christian mobs last weekend that left at least 12 dead and two churches in flames, Interior Ministry officials said on Thursday. Officials said the woman, who identified herself as Abeer Fakhri, 25, was a Coptic Christian who had left her Christian husband for a Muslim man and sought to convert to Islam. When the Muslim man and about 20 other men arrived at the church where he believed she was being held, sectarian street battles erupted. Ms. Fakhri, who has done television interviews, said church authorities had detained her while they encouraged her not to convert. She said she called her Muslim boyfriend, who called the police, but when an officer called she was afraid to speak to him. Her account could not be confirmed. The Coptic Church forbids divorce, and reports of Coptic women converting to end a marriage are common.
