Alright BlackBerry fans, the time has come for you to experience BBM Music. If you havent heard of it yet, its a somewhat inexplicable music subscription service that integrates BBM. As of yet, the app has only been available to beta zone members, but today the app went live in the BlackBerry App World for all to enjoy. And by all, I mean users in the U.S., Canada, and Australia. Heres how it works: For $4.99 a month, youll have the ability to store 50 songs on your BBM Music Profile. Powered by Omnifone, the BBM Music app lets you add friends through BBM integration, at which point you can then get access to the 50 songs on their profiles. So theoretically, you could end up with access to way more than 50 songs, but past your own music, the tracks youll be rocking out to wont necessarily be your style. Oh, and you can only swap out 25 songs a month from your BBM Music Profile. Then, of course, theres a free subscription model. But the catch with this free lunch is big: instead of access to 50 full songs, youll only be allowed to listen to 30-second clips. I cant imagine that the free model will do well  I mean, who enjoys a preview of a song? In any case, you cant blame RIM for trying, especially in such a viral way. The more friends you invite and add to the app, the more bang you get for your buck. Not a bad idea, but only time can tell if this app will fly or die.
