If Acers previous tablet effort was a bit too weighty for you, then consider this: Acer has just announced that their 7-inch WiFi-only Iconia Tab A100 is launching today at retail stores across the country.Its the first 7-inch tablet to sport the latest version of Honeycomb (Android 3.2, if youre keeping track), and it weighs in at a hair under 1 pound. The A100 comes bearing your typical complement of ports: MicroUSB and Micro HDMI (with support for mirroring) mean that this tiny tab works just as well plugged into your television as it does with your computer.Like its big brother, the A100 also supports media streaming through Acers clear.fi service, allowing users to connect and wirelessly share media between DLNA-compatible devices. Meanwhile, the 5 megapixel camera around the back makes sure youll always have a cache of embarassing photos ready to share.The A100 is no slouch when it comes to horsepower either: theres an NVIDIA Tegra 2 dual core processor and 1 GB of RAM running the show. Hopefully that power helps with Flashs often lackluster Android performance, as Flash 10.3 comes pre-installed.Two models will be available at launch: $329 nets you 8 GB of onboard storage, while $349 bumps you up to 16 GB. The media hoarders among you may scoff, but both tablets can accept MicroSD cards up to 32 GB  have fun filling it all up.
