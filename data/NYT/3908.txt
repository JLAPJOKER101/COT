Floods set off by monsoon rains in Bangladesh have killed 6 people, displaced more than 10,000 and washed away shrimp farms close to the Bay of Bengal, the authorities said Friday. The region&rsquo;s Matamuhuri and Bakhkhali Rivers overflowed after five days of heavy rain and inundated about 200 villages, the chief government administrator, Zainul Bari, said. The displaced have taken shelter in school buildings in the flood-hit district of Cox&rsquo;s Bazar, he said. Another government official, Shafiq Mia, said six flood-related deaths had been reported in the area, 185 miles south of Dhaka.
