A court on Monday convicted three former aides of Ichiro Ozawa, the embattled Japanese political kingmaker, of charges related to political campaign financing. The convictions dealt Mr. Ozawa a setback just as his own trial in the scandal was set to begin next week. The aides were sentenced to as many as three years in prison for misreporting almost $6 million in Mr. Ozawa&rsquo;s political funds. Widely credited with engineering the governing Democratic Party&rsquo;s historic victory two years ago, Mr. Ozawa&rsquo;s backroom-style of politics has made him the target of repeated investigations by prosecutors.
