HONG KONG &mdash; China plans to improve its emergency procedures in response to potential problems that became apparent after Japan&rsquo;s nuclear accident in March, the official newspaper, China Daily, reported Monday.        

Chinese nuclear power plant operators will work on ways to respond to multiple accidents that occur at the same time, strengthen flood control plans, reinforce external walls at reactors and make sure the national electricity grid can provide power even in an emergency, the newspaper said, citing Liu Hua, the top nuclear safety regulator at the Ministry of Environmental Protection.        

China is also considering whether to arrange for mobile power generators that can be sent to any nuclear power plant in difficulty, Mr. Liu told the newspaper, while adding that China&rsquo;s reactors meet international standards.        

China&rsquo;s cabinet, the State Council, temporarily suspended approval of new nuclear power plants after the Japanese earthquake, tsunami and nuclear accident, but construction continues at as many as two dozen reactors.
