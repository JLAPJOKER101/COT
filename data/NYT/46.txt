An army major and four other soldiers have been accused of killing three civilians and falsely presenting their bodies as those of guerrillas killed in combat, authorities said Monday. Maj. Juan Carlos Del R&iacute;o Crespo and four others were charged in the 2002 killings of three members of the Agudelo family in Antioquia State, the attorney general&rsquo;s office said in a statement. Investigators determined that troops under Major Del R&iacute;o&rsquo;s command seized the three defenseless men from a sugarcane field where they were working, killed them and later said the deaths happened during combat against the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, a rebel group. In November, the authorities said that they were investigating the extrajudicial killings of 2,650 civilians, and that about 1,100 soldiers were under investigation.
