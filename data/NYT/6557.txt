The initial inadequate response by the police to last summer&rsquo;s riots in London, Birmingham, Manchester and other places allowed the vandalism and looting to spread out of control, according to a parliamentary report released Monday. The report, by the home affairs committee in the House of Commons, said that the police in many areas, particularly London, had failed to take charge of the situation quickly enough, creating an &ldquo;absence of a police presence&rdquo; and the &ldquo;sight of police officers apparently standing by&rdquo; and allowing criminal behavior to occur. A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police in London said that it had already acknowledged its failures and developed new plans for dealing with future riots.
