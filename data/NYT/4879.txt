The Metropolitan Police Service is seeking a court order to force The Guardian to disclose confidential information about its reporting on the phone hacking scandal, The Guardian reported on Friday. Among the materials being sought are documents that would reveal the sources for articles by the reporters Amelia Hill and Nick Davies, including those that accused The News of the World of illegally intercepting the voicemail of a girl who was kidnapped and then murdered. The police say that Ms. Hill and Mr. Davies may have violated a law that forbids the dissemination of potentially damaging material leaked illegally by government officials.
