A special United Nations court convicted two men on Friday of helping mastermind the 1994 Rwandan genocide, and it acquitted two others. The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, based in Arusha, Tanzania, convicted Justin Mugenzi and Prosper Mugiraneza, the former ministers of trade and civil service, sentencing them to 30 years each. The tribunal acquitted two other senior members of Rwanda&rsquo;s former government, Casimir Bizimungu, the former health minister, and Jerome-Clement Bicamumpaka, the former foreign minister.
