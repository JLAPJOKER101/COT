The government said Monday that it was closing public universities to try to curb weeks of violent protests over the death of a student in police custody. The government has said the student, Justin Zongo, died of meningitis, but students say police mistreatment led to his death. They are demanding that the government fire top ministers. On Saturday, two police officers were charged with having beaten Mr. Zongo.
