The Vatican on Monday condemned the most recent ordination of a bishop in China without papal consent, saying that Pope Benedict XVI was &ldquo;deeply saddened&rdquo; by the illegitimate election that damages the unity of the church. The Vatican said that Paul Lei Shiyin, ordained last week by China&rsquo;s state-controlled Catholic Church as the bishop of Leshan, was not recognized as a bishop in the Roman Catholic Church and risked automatic excommunication. China&rsquo;s church ordained another bishop in November, a point of deep contention between Rome and Beijing.
