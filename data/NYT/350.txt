More than a week after torrential rains caused mudslides in mountain towns north of Rio de Janeiro, the death toll has risen to at least 747 people, while rescue workers struggle to locate an additional 333 people who are still missing.  A Red Cross helicopter involved in the rescue effort crashed in strong winds in Nova Friburgo, where the bodies of eight family members were found and carried out, above, on Thursday. A military spokesman said the crew and passengers suffered only light injuries.
