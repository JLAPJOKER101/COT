BEIJING &mdash; China&rsquo;s largest dairy company, the China Mengniu Dairy Company, says it has destroyed a batch of milk contaminated with a substance that can cause liver cancer.        

The contaminated milk was discovered by a government agency that ran spot tests on the milk on Saturday. Mengniu, which has operations in Sichuan Province, posted two notices on its Web site on Sunday apologizing to customers and saying that the rest of its products were safe.        

The substance in the bad batch of milk was aflatoxin, which is produced by a food fungus.        

Starting Sunday, news of the milk became the most popular topic on Sina Weibo, a microblog service. As of Monday morning, people had posted or copied posts on the bad milk nearly four million times.        

Chinese are especially watchful for food scandals, and especially involving milk. In 2008, a nationwide scandal erupted after reports emerged that a toxic chemical added to milk, melamine, had led to the deaths of six children and the illnesses of 300,000 children. That turned into a political controversy, and the Communist Party clamped down on parents who called for proper investigations.
