I was debating with myself whether this should be a post or not, and then decided I should just ask out loud on Twitter if it was a good idea or not. Because three people immediately told me that it was (two of those people were smart, attractive women, I might add), and because TechCrunch founder and former fearless leader Michael Arrington has a long history of identifying porn clones, you are now reading this (NSFW!):Snatchly is a Pinterest for porn. Theres really not much more to say about the site, except that its far from the only raunchy Pinterest clone among Pinterest clones (looking at you, Pornterest).Is there now a single reason left for men to use Pinterest altogether?  Dubbed a virtual pornboard (chuckle), Snatchly lets you save and share all the porn you love from anywhere on the Web, including stuff from some of the most popular porn sites around. If youre so inclined, you can install a snatch it (chuckle) browser bookmarklet to grab images and videos.Obligatory screenshot (did my best to make it SFW, unless your boss loathes cute puppies):
