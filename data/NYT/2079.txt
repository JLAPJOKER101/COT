The United Nations human rights chief called Friday for an independent investigation into the deaths of at least 34 people during an Iraqi military raid on a camp housing Iranian exiles last week. &ldquo;It now seems certain that at least 34 people were killed in Camp Ashraf, including seven or more women,&rdquo; Navi Pillay, the high commissioner for human rights, said in Geneva. &ldquo;Most were shot, and some appear to have been crushed to death, presumably by vehicles. There is no possible excuse for this number of casualties.&rdquo; Iraq has pledged an investigation into the raid.
