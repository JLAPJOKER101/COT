TOKYO (AP) &mdash; A high-ranking Foreign Ministry official will become Japan&rsquo;s new top diplomat after the resignation of his predecessor, who accepted illegal political donations, the government announced Wednesday.        

The official, State Secretary Takeaki Matsumoto, was to be promoted to the post of foreign minister later Wednesday, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano said. Mr. Matsumoto will replace Seiji Maehara, who stepped down Sunday after acknowledging having taken political donations from a foreigner who lived in Japan, which is prohibited.        

The government moved quickly to replace Mr. Maehara, who served in the post for just six months. His resignation was a blow to Prime Minister Naoto Kan&rsquo;s beleaguered government, which is facing public approval ratings below 20 percent.        

Mr. Kan had promised to root out &ldquo;money politics&rdquo; after a veteran power broker in his party was caught up in a scandal.
