Russian authorities announced Monday that they had arrested two brothers suspected of accompanying the suicide bomber who detonated powerful explosives in the arrivals hall of Domodedovo airport in January, killing 35 people.        

The arrests came after two major attacks on militant suspects in the southern region of Ingushetia. The police said 17 suspects were killed Monday, most by airstrikes against what authorities describe as a woodland training camp. One police officer and two officers of the Federal Security Service, Russia&rsquo;s internal intelligence service, were killed in the clashes, a spokesman for the National Antiterrorism Committee told the Interfax news service.        

Ingushetia&rsquo;s leader, Yunus-Bek Yevkurov, said the men killed at the training camp were planning to ambush villagers picking wild garlic in the forest and then blame it on government forces.
