Two Iranian warships have docked in Syria, a military commander said Thursday. The ships arrived Wednesday  after passing through the Suez Canal into the Mediterranean, the first Iranian Navy vessels to do so since Iran&rsquo;s 1979 Islamic Revolution. Iran&rsquo;s navy commander, Rear Adm. Habibollah Sayyari, told reporters the ships were not performing  military exercises but were &ldquo;on a routine and friendly visit and carry the message of peace and friendship to world countries.&rdquo; In Israel, Defense Minister Ehud Barak called it &ldquo;a provocation,&rdquo; but told CNN, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that any one of us should be worried by it.&rdquo;
