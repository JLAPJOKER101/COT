The Gillmor Gang — Danny Sullivan, Dan Farber, Dan Taschek, and Dan Gillmor — no, thats not right. Steve Gillmor, Steve Taschek No. Without Scoble, we have little time to get to the point, which this week is Googles Do As Much Evil as Possible Tour. @dannysullivan returns with a 20 minute diatribe on paid inclusion, whatever that means.
 
Without Kevin Marks, we have to fend for ourselves until @stevegillmor picks a fight about Googles war with Apple and its consequences for Google +. In rebuttal, Danny ends up proving @stevegillmor even more right than usual. Hovering just off camera is the sense that with all this talent and possibility, shouldnt these guys work together as they did when the disruption began? Hey, how old are you anyway?@stevegillmor, @dannysullivan, @dbfarber, @jtaschekProduced and directed by Tina Chase Gillmor @tinagillmor
