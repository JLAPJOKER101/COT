The Communist Party newspaper Granma published an article on Monday praising the more than 1,000 independent shops that sell building materials in Cuba, saying that the stores give Cubans more access to supplies without having to navigate the bureaucracy. &ldquo;Acquiring these products no longer means immersing oneself in the tangle of innumerable &lsquo;legal&rsquo; documents that, in many cases, facilitated corruption and favoritism toward a &lsquo;chosen&rsquo; few who were not always the most in need,&rdquo; the paper said. The government has long controlled all construction on the island. Cement and other building materials were available in theory at state-run stores at heavily subsidized prices, but demand greatly outstripped supply in part due to pilfering from state stocks.
