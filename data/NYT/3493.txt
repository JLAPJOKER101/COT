Senegal has deployed troops around ministry buildings and an important route in the capital, Dakar, a spokesman said Wednesday, in a bid to forestall further rioting after several days of antigovernment violence. Offices of the state power company Senelec were burned in riots on Monday night by protesters angry over power cuts lasting hours. &ldquo;The situation is back to normal now,&rdquo; said Serigne Mback&eacute; Ndiaye, a spokesman for President Abdoulaye Wade, adding that Mr. Wade, above, had decided to forgo a trip to the African Union summit meeting in Equatorial Guinea in order to watch over the situation in Senegal. Last week, the capital was rocked by riots over Mr. Wade&rsquo;s plan, subsequently withdrawn, to change electoral rules in what demonstrators said was an effort to prolong his rule.
