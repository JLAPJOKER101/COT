A Chinese writer and government critic arrived in Berlin on Wednesday after a journey that included transfers in Hanoi, Vietnam and Warsaw, he said in a telephone interview. The writer, Liao Yiwu, who had been living in Sichuan Province, said the police had visited him often in recent months to deliver veiled threats that if he published any more works abroad, he would be jailed. He was also barred from leaving China to attend a literary festival in Australia in March and removed from a plane in the southwestern city of Chengdu in February on his way to Germany for Europe&rsquo;s largest literary festival. Mr. Liao is most known for &ldquo;The Corpse Walker,&rdquo; a series of interviews with people living in the margins of Chinese society, including a professional mourner, a political prisoner and a public-toilet manager.
