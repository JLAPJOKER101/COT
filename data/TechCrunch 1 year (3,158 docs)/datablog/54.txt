Yelp today reported its earnings for the second quarter of 2012, its second ever financial report as a publicly-traded company. Overall, the reviews site showed continued top-line revenue growth and a smaller net loss than it has posted in the past  a performance that bested the estimates of Wall Street analysts.Yelps Q2 revenue was $32.7 million, up 19 percent from the previous quarter and up 67 percent year-over-year from the second quarter of 2011.The companys operations are not yet in the black, but the bottom line performance was better than many expected. Yelps Q2 net loss was $2 million, or negative 3 cents per share. Thats a big step up from the $9.8 million loss the company posted in the first quarter of 2012. Its still more than its Q2 2011 loss of $1.2 million  however, that was notably before the company started incurring the costs associated with trading on the stock market. On an adjusted basis, Yelps EBITDA was $1.6 million, nearly 1.5 times more than the $649,000 in adjusted EBITDA it brought in during Q2 2011.Analysts estimated that Yelp would have a loss of negative six cents per share during Q2 2012, so the Street may well be pleased with these results.Also today, Yelp boosted its projection for full-year 2012 revenues: It now says it should make between $135-136 million during 2012, representing growth of 62-63 percent from 2011. Previously, the company expected it would make between $128 million to $132 million in 2012, so this is certainly a much sunnier outlook.Here is a graph illustrating todays earnings as compared to Yelps history, cooked up by TechCrunch graphic designer Bryce Durbin:And heres a statement from Yelp co-founder and CEO Jeremy Stoppelman:Yelps second quarter performance highlights the underlying power of our model.
