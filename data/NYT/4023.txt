Heavy fighting broke out Thursday in the capital, Mogadishu, as African Union peacekeepers launched an offensive to protect famine relief efforts from attacks by the Shabab rebels, officials said. At least six people died. The Shabab, which initially said they would allow the aid to be delivered, changed their mind last week. The rebels have sent 300 reinforcement fighters to Mogadishu in recent days, said Lt. Col. Paddy Ankunda, spokesman for the African Union peacekeeping force. He said the Shabab were trying to prevent aid from reaching the tens of thousands of famine refugees who have poured into Mogadishu this month.
