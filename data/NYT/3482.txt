British officials were left red-faced after a radical Islamic leader banned from the United Kingdom managed to get into the country anyway. Sheik Raed Salah, the head of the Islamic Movement in Israel, has since been arrested and is now fighting deportation proceedings, but opposition politicians on Wednesday demanded to know how Sheik Salah, an Israeli Arab, gained entry in the first place. A Labour lawmaker, Yvette Cooper, called on the Conservative-led government to &ldquo;explain why an individual banned from this country was allowed to walk in and instead of being stopped at the border had to be pursued by the police instead.&rdquo; Sheik Salah had arrived to address Parliament, but news of his invitation outraged many lawmakers. The home secretary, Theresa May, declined to comment directly on the case but vowed to block anyone whose presence &ldquo;is not conducive to the public good.&rdquo; It was reported that Ms. May had tried to prevent Sheik Salah from entering the country.
