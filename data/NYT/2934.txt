The authorities in Europe stepped up efforts on Monday to halt a deadly E. coli outbreak, and Spain and Germany argued over the source of the bacteria. Officials in Germany said the death toll had climbed to 13 in one of the largest outbreaks ever reported. Hundreds of Europeans have suffered from diarrhea, cramps and other symptoms, and vegetables have been pulled from shelves in a number of countries. Germany said Spanish cucumbers could be a source, an announcement that Spain called &ldquo;an irresponsibility and an atrocity.&rdquo; A crucial question was whether the disease could have developed on delivery routes between Spain and Germany, or in storage areas.
