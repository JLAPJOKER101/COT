After a closely watched debate, Mexico&rsquo;s Supreme Court refused to throw out a state anti-abortion amendment on Wednesday. Although 7 of the 11 justices agreed that the Baja California State amendment was unconstitutional, the court was one vote shy of the supermajority needed to strike it down. After Mexico City became the only place in the country to legalize abortion in 2007, 17 states altered their constitutions to declare that life begins at conception. President Felipe Calder&oacute;n and his wife, Margarita Zavala, intervened in the debate, urging the justices to let the state laws stand. The court will consider a challenge to another state&rsquo;s anti-abortion law on Thursday.
