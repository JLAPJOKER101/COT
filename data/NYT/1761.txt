In a departure from tradition, Prime Minister Yves Leterme berated the king&rsquo;s 47-year-old son, Prince Laurent, in Parliament, saying the prince should take government advice on trips or lose his generous royal stipend. Mr. Leterme said that the prince, who did not attend the session, had disregarded a written request by the government when he traveled to Congo this month and met with President Joseph Kabila without diplomatic oversight. The prince, who campaigns for environmental causes, said he went to study deforestation. The prince&rsquo;s stipend of about $400,000 may be at risk, but there is likely to be little change to his reputation one way or the other &mdash; he has long raised eyebrows for his fast driving, expensive tastes and blunt speech.
