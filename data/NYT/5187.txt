Two severed heads were found on a busy highway near the Defense Ministry in Mexico City on Monday, a reminder that the capital has not entirely escaped the violence sweeping large parts of the country. One head was found on the hood of a sport utility vehicle and the other near it on a sidewalk, along with a message from a criminal gang known as the Hand With Eyes, claiming Mexico City as its territory. It was unclear whether the heads were intended to send a message to the military, which has been deployed to fight the drug cartels. Very little cartel-related mayhem has been reported in Mexico City, but a decapitated body was found in another part of the city in August.
