Witnesses and a local government official said that at least five people were killed and an additional 10 were wounded on Tuesday when government forces fired on a demonstration against the Shabab, a radical Islamist group that has taken over many parts of the country. It is not yet clear why the government forces, which are plagued by a lack of discipline, fired on the demonstrators, and the government did not issue a statement on the violence.
