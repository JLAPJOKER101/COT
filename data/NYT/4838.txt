ROME (AP) &mdash; Dan David, a Romanian-born businessman who set up a foundation that annually awards $1 million prizes to people who have made an impact on society, died Sept. 6 in London. He was 82.        

The cause was a brain hemorrhage, said his son, Ariel. Mr. David had homes in Italy, Britain and Israel.        

With Romania&rsquo;s Communist authorities frowning on his involvement in a Zionist youth movement, he left in 1960 and emigrated to Israel. He made his fortune as an early developer of automatic photo machines.        

The Dan David Foundation awards three $1 million prizes each year for achievements having an outstanding scientific, technological, cultural or social impact on the world. Winners have included the moviemaking brothers Joel and Ethan Coen, the cellist Yo-Yo Ma and former Vice President Al Gore. The Dan David Prize is handed out at Tel Aviv University.        

In addition to his son, Mr. David is survived by his wife, Gabriela.
