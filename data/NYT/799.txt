The radical art collective Voina has been shortlisted for a contemporary art award by Russia&rsquo;s Ministry of Culture and the National Center for Contemporary Art for a project  that consisted of a 210-foot penis painted on a drawbridge in St. Petersburg. The nomination came despite the fact that two of the group&rsquo;s leaders await trial on hooliganism charges that could bring a sentence of up to seven years &mdash; the fallout from an action they called &ldquo;Palace Revolution,&rdquo; which involved running up to parked police cars and turning them upside-down. A St. Petersburg judge refused to grant bail for the two last month, despite an offer to pay from Banksy, the mysterious British street artist. Voina&rsquo;s other actions have included an orgy in the State Museum of Biology and throwing live cats over a counter at McDonald&rsquo;s, but they drew special attention for the drawbridge painting,  which slowly rose to point at the St. Petersburg headquarters of the state security service, the F.S.B. It stood for several hours before the authorities had it scrubbed off.
