Facebook may not be opposing the Stop Online Piracy Act and the Protect IP Act as prominently as some other websites — its not blacking out the site today, or even posting an anti-SOPA/PIPA message on its homepage — but CEO Mark Zuckerberg spoke out against the legislation in a post on his Facebook account.Zuckerberg wrote:The internet is the most powerful tool we have for creating a more open and connected world. We cant let poorly thought out laws get in the way of the internets development. Facebook opposes SOPA and PIPA, and we will continue to oppose any laws that will hurt the internet.The world today needs political leaders who are pro-internet. We have been working with many of these folks for months on better alternatives to these current proposals. I encourage you to learn more about these issues and tell your congressmen that you want them to be pro-internet.He then points readers to a Facebook page with more details about the companys opposition to the bills and about how people can get involved in the issue.SOPA and PIPA even stirred Zuckerberg to post to Twitter. His Twitter account has been dormant since March 2009, but today he tweeted again — with a link to his Facebook post.
