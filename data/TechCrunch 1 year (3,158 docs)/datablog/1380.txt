As 100% of our readers know, there is a major Apple event tomorrow morning here in San Francisco. We presume it will be the debut of a brand new high-res iPad (3, HD, 2X, or other), but signs have pointed to some secondary announcements as well. Apple TV (not the Apple TV) is tipped to be getting a refresh, and chances are that iOS 5.1 will be shown off in detail, if not its successor.Well be at the event with our 4G dongles hot, reporting the new products and features the second theyre announced. So tune in tomorrow morning (the event starts at 10AM Pacific time) for our live coverage.And, of course, stay for the dozen or so Apple-related posts and editorials that will follow in its wake.
