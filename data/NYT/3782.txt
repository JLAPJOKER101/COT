The first American troops have left Afghanistan as part of President Obama&rsquo;s planned drawdown of about a third of the 100,000 forces there during the next year. Lt. Col. Wayne Perry, a spokesman for the NATO-led coalition, said about 650 troops who had completed their rotation in Afghanistan left on Wednesday as scheduled, and would not be replaced. The first 10,000 troops were to return to the United States by the end of the year, but Mr. Obama left the details up to his commanders. The units that left this week were the Army National Guard&rsquo;s First Squadron, 134th Cavalry Regiment, based in Kabul, and the Army National Guard&rsquo;s First Squadron, 113th Cavalry Regiment, which had been in Parwan Province. Afghan security forces are to take over security responsibility from foreign forces in seven areas of the country this summer.
