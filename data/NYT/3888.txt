Canada&rsquo;s former military commander in Afghanistan was fined about $7,400 and given a symbolic reduction in rank after pleading guilty to having had a sexual relationship with a subordinate and for trying to block an investigation of the affair. The former commander, Daniel M&eacute;nard, 45, a brigadier general, had his rank reduced to colonel by a military judge in Montreal on Thursday. But because he has retired from the military, he will retain his former rank. General M&eacute;nard had the relationship with a female master corporal under his command in Afghanistan.
