Its that time again! Right on schedule (with on schedule meaning roughly 2 weeks since the last one), Apple has just released the sixth Beta build of iOS 5 to developers.You know what that means: developers, get to updating (Remember: OTA updates work now!) Non-developers pretending to be developers, carry on (Just dont be a jerk and go reviewing applications.) And everyone else? Be happy to know that iOS 5 is one big ol step closer to going gold and hitting your handset.Now, as for whats new in this buildThough most are just crackin into beta 6 right this second, were not hearing much in terms of new stuff here â€” its mostly bug fixes and itty bitty spots of polish at this point. Which, of course, makes sense: Apples presumably nearing the end of the Beta phase here, so its less about adding new stuff and more about making sure everything thats in there works as expected.With that said, well update you if we hear about anything new and noteworthy lurking around in this release.
