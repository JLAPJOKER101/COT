The Obama administration said Monday that the former Haitian president Jean-Bertrand Aristide should refrain from returning to Haiti before the presidential runoff election on Sunday. A State Department spokesman, Mark Toner, said that Mr. Aristide, above, had the right to return, but doing so this week &ldquo;can only be seen as a conscious choice to impact Haiti&rsquo;s elections.&rdquo; A delay, Mr. Toner said, would &ldquo;permit the Haitian people to cast their ballots in a peaceful atmosphere.&rdquo; He said the United States was asking South Africa, where Mr. Aristide has lived in exile since 2004, to delay his departure. Mr. Aristide&rsquo;s lawyer, Ira Kurzban, said the United States &ldquo;should leave that decision to the democratically elected government instead of seeking to dictate the terms under which a Haitian citizen may return to his country.&rdquo;
