Israel on Wednesday allowed the export of cherry tomatoes from Gaza for the first time since Hamas took control in 2007, Palestinian officials said. The two and half tons of tomatoes were bound for the Netherlands, which finances agricultural projects in Gaza. The Dutch have received permission to ship more than 450 truckloads of carnations, strawberries and sweet peppers to European markets.
