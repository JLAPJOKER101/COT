Gunmen attacked a minibus carrying mostly Shiites and killed eight people on Friday in a part of northwestern Pakistan that has seen a recent peace deal between rival Sunni and Shiite tribes, a government official said. The gunmen who carried out the ambush in the Bagan area of the Kurram tribal region also kidnapped 18 people from the bus, said Javid Khan, a local administrator. The attack was the latest blow to the deal, which was meant to end a four-year conflict that cost hundreds of lives. The bus was attacked as it was traveling on the main road that runs through Kurram and connects the main town in the region, Parachinar, with Peshawar.
