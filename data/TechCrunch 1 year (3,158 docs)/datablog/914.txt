The race to be the Instagram for video is hotter than ever, and Socialcam, the app that spun out of video sharing pioneer Justin.tv last year and was part of Y Combinators winter 2012 class, is hustling hard for the lead. The company has raised seed funding from a group of angel investors that reads like a whos who list of tech and entertainment industry heavyweights.Ive been hearing whispers about Socialcams crazy angel round for weeks now, and Ive finally verified the full list of the startups seed backers. Unfortunately Ive not been able to ascertain the exact amount of money the company has raised, though  when I reached out to Socialcam CEO Michael Seibel for more detail today, he would only say that the list speaks for itself. (Dont worry, Ill keep working on getting that dollar amount.)Ive pasted the entire list at the bottom of this post, but some of the names include (in no particular order): Tim Draper, Yuri Milner, Ari Emmanuel, Laurene Powell Jobs, Ashton Kutcher, Brian Chesky, Paul Buchheit, Alexis Ohanian, and many more.Socialcams chief competitor is Viddy, an app that also lets users shoot, edit and share videos from their smartphones, and the battle between the two companies is fast and furious. Earlier today Socialcam pulled past Viddy as the top video/photo app in the iTunes app store (see screenshot at right)  but its been a horse race of sorts, as the two apps have switched spots on the list several times since I started writing this article. As far as user numbers go, Im hearing that Socialcam has pushed past the 20 million mark (just last week the number was at around 12 million.) Viddy reportedly just passed 15 million users. Now, one detail is very important to understand: These user numbers do not represent the downloads Socialcam and Viddy have as apps on mobile devices  theyre the number of people who have downloaded the apps on Facebook. Both Socialcam and Viddy have enjoyed viral growth on the Facebook platform, as people are curious to watch the videos posted by their friends. But that does not necessarily mean they themselves become avid Socialcam or Viddy users. It takes a bit more commitment to download an app to your iPhone or Android device, and neither company has released those figures yet.More comparisons between the two apps: Socialcam still has just three full-time employees, compared to Viddys twenty-some, though Seibel tells me his company is looking to hire aggressively in the weeks ahead. Viddy has raised $6 million in Series A funding and is said to be in the process of raising some $30 more at a sky-high $370 million valuation. Socialcam, again, is staying mum on its exact funding numbers.Socialcam is based in San Francisco while Viddy is based in Los Angeles, so the apps have reputations for attracting different crowds as investors and users: The Silicon Valley set for Socialcam, the Hollywood crowd for Viddy. But that geographical characterization is increasingly inaccurate. Socialcam has nabbed Hollywood power agent Ari Emmanuel as a backer, and Britney Spears apparently just joined the service this past weekend posting a video of her sons dancing around. Viddy meanwhile counts Twitter co-founder Biz Stone as an investor, and Mark Zuckerberg joined the service yesterday to post a video of his dog.One thing is for sure: The battle here is far from over  and Instagram itself could still emerge as the Instagram for video  but at the moment its pretty fun to watch it all play out.As promised, here is the full list of Socialcams angel investors:Brian Chesky  CEO, Airbnb
