The American ambassador, Robert S. Ford, left, and other Western diplomats attended a gathering to mourn the killing of a human rights advocate, activists said Wednesday. The visit on Tuesday could increase the already high tensions between the United States and Syria, which has accused Washington of helping incite violence in Syria. The authorities have criticized two earlier visits by Mr. Ford to the country&rsquo;s central and southern regions during the six-month-old uprising against the government; both visits were to sites that had been the scene of protests and violence. The activist who was killed, Ghayath Mattar, was detained on Sept. 6 and his body was returned to his family over the weekend.
