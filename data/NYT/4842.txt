The metals company whose broken reservoir killed 10 people last year when several Hungarian towns were flooded with caustic red sludge has been fined the equivalent of about $647 million for environmental damages. The 25-acre reservoir at the plant owned by the MAL Hungarian Aluminum Production and Trade Company released a torrent of about 184 million gallons of red sludge, a byproduct of aluminum production, on three towns in western Hungary in October 2010. The highly caustic material injured more than 150 people, many of whom suffered chemical burns. The fine is more than four times as much as the amount the government has said it spent on cleanup and reconstruction projects. It took into account the &ldquo;unprecedented&rdquo; amount of hazardous material released, the Ministry of Rural Development said Wednesday.
