President Michel Martelly has nominated a United Nations development expert to be his prime minister, in his third attempt to install a new head of government. Mr. Martelly&rsquo;s designation of Garry Conille, 45, a physician who had served as aide to former President Bill Clinton in Mr. Clinton&rsquo;s role as special United Nations envoy in Haiti, followed the rejection by Haitian lawmakers in June and August of two other nominees. These rejections have blocked the formation of a new Haitian government four months after Mr. Martelly, a former pop star, took office with a public promise to turn Haiti, the Western Hemisphere&rsquo;s poorest state, into a Caribbean success story.
