This week we bring you the Fujifilm X10, the Galaxy Tab 8.9, and my new standing desk. The standing desk, incidentally, is my second desk, which puts me firmly in the 1% camp when it comes to home workstations.I write a little about my standing desk here but generally its a FREDRICK desk from Ikea set up so I have my keyboard and mouse at waist level and monitor by my head.We also talk about Devins favorite camera this week, the Fujifilm X10, and my favorite Android tablet this week, the Galaxy Tab 8.9. Ive included MP3 downloads and RSS feeds for your listening pleasure.Download MP3Subscribe in iTunesRSS Feed
