While Google Wallet didnt come out this summer as expected, Google has just unveiled first Google Wallet commercial, starring none other than Seinfelds George Costanza and his overstuffed wallet.For those of you who arent familiar, the George Costanza wallet was made famous in the Seinfeld episode The Reverse Peephole where George carries around a wallet so fat that it interferes with him sitting and makes his back hurt. It looks like Google has remastered the explosion scene from that episode to promote its NFC product, directing people to http://www.google.com/wallet for more info.Ive emailed Google for specific Wallet launch dates and will update this post when they get back to me, in the meantime, here is some dialogue and scenes from the original episode.Jerry Seinfeld/strong>: Your back hurts because of your wallet. Its huge.
George Costanza: This isnt just my wallet. Its an organizer, a memory and an old friend.
Jerry Seinfeld: Well, your friend is morbidly obese.
George Costanza: Well, at least I dont carry a purse.
Jerry Seinfeld: Its not a purse, its European.
