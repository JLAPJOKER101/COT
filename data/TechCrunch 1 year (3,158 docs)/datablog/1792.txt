About a year ago, my pal Nick De Mey from Board of Innovation shared a great slidedeck about the 10 business models that rocked 2010. This year, the Board identified 7 business models that failed in 2011 (Slideshare link).Learn from the failures of Airbnb (which, for the record, is doing great but did enjoy some PR backlash in 2011), HiGear (the Airbnb for luxury cars that just folded), Swoopo, Nokia, RIM, Netflix, Bitcoin and two companies outside of the tech industry: Dexia and Southwest Airlines.The presentation is best viewed in full-screen. Are there any business models you would have included in the list?
