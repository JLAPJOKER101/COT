MOSCOW &mdash; When Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. sat down for his meeting with Vladimir V. Putin this week, the Russian prime minister opened with a curveball.        

After noting joint projects on the table &mdash; cooperation on missile defense and Russia&rsquo;s accession to the World Trade Organization, among others &mdash; Mr. Putin cheerily suggested a brand-new idea: abolishing visa requirements between Russia and the United States. The early part of the meeting was featured on Russian television.        

Mr. Biden responded &ldquo;Good idea,&rdquo; and Mr. Putin seized on the response, saying he hoped Mr. Biden would make the case for the change in Washington. The vice president then backpedaled, explaining that he does not decide such matters.        

&ldquo;Mr. Prime Minister, in case you haven&rsquo;t noticed, there&rsquo;s a real difference between being president and vice president,&rdquo; he said, perhaps referring to the structure of Russia&rsquo;s leadership, in which Mr. Putin occupies the country&rsquo;s second-highest post but is widely viewed as its paramount leader.        

Visa liberalization had been the subject of informal discussion before the meeting, said Anthony J. Blinken, the vice president&rsquo;s national security adviser. &ldquo;The Russians know full well, as do the Americans, that there are legal requirements set by Congress to be met for visa liberalization that the Russians have not yet achieved,&rdquo; including bringing the visa refusal rate down below 3 percent, Mr. Blinken said.        

Asked when that might occur, he said, &ldquo;it could be next year, it could be in 10 years.&rdquo;        

The Russian press on Friday reported Mr. Putin&rsquo;s proposal as top news from Mr. Biden&rsquo;s visit, shifting the focus from coverage of the vice president&rsquo;s public criticism of Russia&rsquo;s legal and political systems. One report the next day suggested the prime minister had succeeded in disarming his visitor.        

In the daily newspaper Kommersant, a reporter, Andrei Kolesnikov, took some liberties with the moment, telling readers: &ldquo;&nbsp;&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Mr. Biden, quickly writing something in his notebook (either Mr. Putin&rsquo;s idea, or some phrase like, &lsquo;Joe, get ahold of yourself! Give him a good answer! You are the vice president of a great country!&rsquo;)&rdquo;        

Dmitri V. Trenin, director of the Carnegie Moscow Center, said Mr. Putin&rsquo;s suggestion was probably aimed at dominating Friday&rsquo;s news cycle. He described it as a &ldquo;successful operation.&rdquo;        

&ldquo;As a way to attract attention, yes, it worked,&rdquo; Mr. Trenin said. &ldquo;As a way to knock someone off course, maybe it also worked.&rdquo;        

Interactions between Mr. Putin and foreign leaders are scrutinized here as an especially revealing type of political theater. It was 10 years ago that President George W. Bush remarked warmly, after one of his first meetings with a still little-known Mr. Putin, &ldquo;I looked the man in the eye. I was able to get a sense of his soul.&rdquo;        

When President Obama visited Russia in July 2009, his breakfast with Mr. Putin ran for two hours, the first of which was largely an uninterrupted monologue by Mr. Putin, aides said afterward.        

After, Mr. Putin and Mr. Biden met privately for 15 minutes in Mr. Putin&rsquo;s office. On Thursday, a senior American administration official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, described the meeting as &ldquo;a serious discussion about serious issues,&rdquo; including cooperation on missile defense, accession to the World Trade Organization, Georgia, Afghanistan and energy.        

On Friday, Mr. Biden continued to Moldova, a former Soviet republic where a pro-Western coalition took power in 2009, displacing an old-guard Communist leadership. Addressing an overflow crowd in Opera House Square in the capital, Chisnau, where young demonstrators gathered two years ago in what became known as the &ldquo;Twitter Revolution,&rdquo; Mr. Biden linked Moldova&rsquo;s transition to the uprisings that have upended North Africa and the Middle East.        

He said he was glad &ldquo;to be here at this transformative moment in your history, and quite frankly in the history of the world. Freedom is in the air, and democracy is emerging in countries that for generations have known nothing but authoritarian rule.&rdquo;
