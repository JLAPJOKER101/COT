WASHINGTON &mdash; Al Qaeda&rsquo;s Egyptian-born second in command, Ayman al-Zawahri, attacked secular rule in Egypt in an audio lecture released Friday, but the message appeared to have been recorded before President Hosni Mubarak stepped down last week.        

Experts on the terrorist network have been eager to hear its reaction to the nonreligious demonstrations that led to the ouster of presidents in Tunisia and Egypt. But Mr. Zawahri&rsquo;s lecture, though titled &ldquo;A Message of Hope and Glad Tidings to Our People in Egypt,&rdquo; referred to Mr. Mubarak as &ldquo;the biggest Arab Zionist&rdquo; and to his son Gamal as &ldquo;the awaited leader,&rdquo; suggesting that it was recorded before Mr. Mubarak&rsquo;s resignation on Feb. 11.        

Mr. Zawahri, believed to be hiding in Pakistan, was imprisoned and tortured in Egypt in the  1980s, shortly after Mr. Mubarak began his nearly 30-year rule.
