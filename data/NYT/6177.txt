The prime minister and his cabinet resigned Monday amid accusations of corruption and pressure for reforms from a broad coalition including Islamists and liberals. The opposition has been calling for the dismissal of the prime minister, Sheik Nasser Mohammed al-Ahmed al-Sabah, left, a member of the royal family whom they suspect of corruption, an accusation he denies. The standoff intensified last month, when a mob of angry demonstrators stormed the Parliament building. The emir, Sheik Sabah al-Ahmed al-Sabah, accepted the resignations, but then directed the officials to remain in office as a caretaker government. The outraged opposition staged an all-night protest near Parliament.
