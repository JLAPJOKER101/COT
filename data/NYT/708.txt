The American ambassador pressed the Pakistani president on Monday to release an American official who Washington said was detained illegally after he shot and killed two men in Lahore. Ambassador Cameron Munter met with President Asif Ali Zardari in Islamabad after repeated American demands for the release of the American, identified as Raymond Allen Davis, left. The United States said that Mr. Davis acted in self-defense when he shot two men who were trying to rob him, and that he must be released under diplomatic immunity. Mr. Munter told Mr. Zardari that &ldquo;Pakistan must comply with its obligations under international law and immediately release the American diplomat illegally detained in Lahore,&rdquo; an embassy spokeswoman said. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton also raised the case with the Pakistan Army chief, Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, on the sidelines of an international security conference in Germany over the weekend, the State Department said.
