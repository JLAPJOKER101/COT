A statue to honor former President Woodrow Wilson has been unveiled in the Czech capital again, nearly 70 years after the Nazis destroyed the first one. The original statue of Wilson, who died in 1924, was erected in front of Prague&rsquo;s Central Station in 1928 in gratitude for his contribution to the creation of an independent Czechoslovakia in 1918 after the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian empire. In 1941, during the German occupation, the statue was destroyed.
