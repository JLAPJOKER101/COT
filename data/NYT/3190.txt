Six more workers at the tsunami-damaged nuclear power plant have exceeded the radiation exposure limit, according to the preliminary results of tests announced by the Health and Labor Ministry on Monday. The new cases bring the total to eight. Three of the men were control room operators at the Fukushima Daiichi plant and five worked to restore power that was knocked out by the earthquake and tsunami on March 11. The plant&rsquo;s operator, Tokyo Electric Power, said none of them were showing immediate health problems but they would require long-term monitoring as they had an increased risk of cancer. All eight have been transferred to desk jobs.
