Mobile video app Vlix is launching a new version of its Instagram-like mobile video sharing iOS app with text-in-video options to video effects, filters, effects and more. The app is currently available in the App Store for free.Basically, Vlix allows users to post short video (a max of 1 minute) on the fly, but add cool effects, text, edit the content and more. Via the app, you can capture a video and then add artistic filters, and effects like reverse, slow-mo, brighten, and color boost. You can also add customizable text that appears at the start and end of video, and share videos to a private group or to email, YouTube, Facebook and Twitter.New features to the app, which originally debuted in April, is the ability to enter the app and browse through featured videos by other Vlix members without having to register as well as the ability to save videos to the iPhones camera roll. Additionally Vlix allows you to create a pre-roll short video to run before all of your posted videos.When you are ready to post a video from Vlix (after using the companys dead simple editing tool), you render the video (which takes second using Vlixs proprietary technology), and post. Fellow users within the apps (you can follow other users) can comment and like your video, and you can see how many views it has received.In many ways, the ease of adding effects to video as well as editing makes the app similar to an Instagram for video. The Vlix folks also have experience with online video. They operate One True Media, a simple video slideshow creation site that sees over 6 million users posting over 10,000 videos a day and over 5,000 videos a day posted to YouTube and Facebook. The companys other startup SpotMixer allows businesses to create videos for online, TV and mobile.Vlix has raised $16 million in funding from Kleiner Perkins, and DAG Ventures.
