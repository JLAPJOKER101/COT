A Gambian lawyer, Fatou Bensouda, is expected to succeed Luis Moreno-Ocampo next June as chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court in The Hague. She emerged as the consensus candidate after the only other finalist, Mohamed Chande Othman of Tanzania, agreed to withdraw, diplomats said. All six cases before the young court are linked to African nations, and the majority of the 119 countries that recognize the court had favored an African candidate. Elections for the prosecutor and six judges will be held at the members&rsquo; annual meeting on Dec. 12. Mrs. Bensouda, 50, has been deputy prosecutor at the court, and served at the United Nations tribunal dealing with the genocide in Rwanda and as minister of justice of Gambia.
