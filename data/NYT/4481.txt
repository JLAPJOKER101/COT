Zimbabwe&rsquo;s vice president is questioning how her husband, a well-known power broker, died &mdash; fueling suspicions that the former army chief may have been killed. The state-run Herald newspaper Wednesday quoted Vice President Joice Mujuru as saying that she wanted &ldquo;satisfactory answers&rdquo; from an investigation into last week&rsquo;s death of her husband, Gen. Solomon Mujuru, in a house fire. She questioned why he was unable to escape through bedroom windows so large and low that &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t have to jump out, you just lift your leg.&rdquo; The death has intensified infighting in the party of President Robert Mugabe, where the general was a powerful figure who used his military, political and business connections to promote his wife&rsquo;s political ambitions.
