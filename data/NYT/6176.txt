A German NATO officer and a soldier were shot and wounded and about 23 Austrian and German peacekeepers injured in clashes with protesting Serbs in northern Kosovo on Monday after NATO troops used heavy machinery to remove trucks and buses blocking a main road, an official said. The violence near the town of Zubin Potok comes after months of tensions following a decision by the government to extend its authority in areas under de facto Serb rule. The fighting broke out Monday when peacekeepers for NATO began removing roadblocks erected by Serbs in July.
