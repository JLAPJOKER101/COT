BEIJING &mdash; China is considering an income tax cut, but its impact may be smaller than expected.        

The initiative, which was taken up by the country&rsquo;s legislature on Wednesday and could become law this year, would raise the minimum income required to pay the tax to $450 a month from $315.        

News reports have said the increase is a way to reduce the tax burden on low- to middle-income earners &mdash; a highly delicate issue in China, which has one of the largest gaps between rich and poor in the world. The nation also is suffering from a relatively high inflation rate, especially for food and fuel. The official news agency Xinhua called the proposal &ldquo;good news for consumers amid rising inflation.&rdquo;        

But the move may actually do little to help the poor because the tax cut will affect people who earn average incomes, in urban areas about $450 a month. Minimum-wage earners, who earn about $184 a month in the cities, were earning so little already that they did not have to pay income taxes.        

Only a small percentage of Chinese file income tax forms &mdash; about 26 million in all &mdash; and they tend to be high earners. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that this move is going to do anything to improve the distribution of income in China,&rdquo; said Nicholas R. Lardy of the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. &ldquo;If anything, it&rsquo;ll do the opposite.&rdquo;        

The main effect of the tax cut would be to remove several million people &mdash; estimates vary widely &mdash; from the tax rolls, allowing the authorities to concentrate on taxing those who make more.        

Analysts dismissed reports that the proposed tax changes were in response to recent signs of unrest &mdash; including this week among Shanghai container-truck drivers who were protesting high fuel prices. The changes were part of the 12th Five Year Plan, passed last year.
