This shouldnt be the first time youve seen Skullcandys Hesh headphones appear on TechCrunch, but Ill forgive you if it is. As a refresh, I reviewed the cans last week and found that it really came down to like vs. love. Theyre fine, but I cant necessarily justify a $60-$70 purchase.John felt the same way when we sat down to chat about the Hesh headphones in this latest episode of Fly or Die. But it extends far beyond that. As John would say, friends dont let friends buy bad headphones.There should really only be two choices: get yourself a cheap pair of earbuds that will last you six months, or if you really enjoy high quality sound, make a solid investment in a set of Grado or Sennheisers or the upper echelon of headphones and really enjoy yourself.Either way, mid-range headphones shouldnt even exist in our book. They offer very little in sound quality and try to make up for it with style and brand cache, like Beats.Beats by Dr. Dre headphones certainly arent the best headphones on the market, but the following behind them is huge, based mainly on the fact that Dres name is behind them and they look cool. Beats is about status, and the very worst part is that Skullcandy doesnt even have that going for it.We both give them a die.
