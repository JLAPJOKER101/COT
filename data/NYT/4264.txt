A Nigerian man who fled to his homeland after being accused of defrauding dozens of lawyers and law firms of more than $31 million has been extradited to the United States, Nigeria&rsquo;s antigraft agency said Friday. The suspect, Emmanuel Ekhator, was arrested in Benin City and handed over to United States marshals in New York on Thursday, said Femi Babafemi, the antigraft body&rsquo;s spokesman. According to federal prosecutors, Mr. Ekhator helped run a scam in which one person would call a law firm posing as someone who needed to collect a debt, a second person posing as the debtor agrees to pay, the lawyers collect a fake check, which is validated by a third scammer posing as a bank employee, and the firms pay the debt using their own funds to their supposed client in Asia.
