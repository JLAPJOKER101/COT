SEATTLE (AP) &mdash; Der Spiegel, the German news organization, published photographs Sunday showing two American soldiers in Afghanistan posing with the corpse of an Afghan civilian they are accused of murdering.        

The photos were among several seized by Army investigators looking into the deaths of three unarmed Afghans last year. Five soldiers based at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, south of Seattle, have been charged with murder and conspiracy. Because of their content, the photos were placed under a strict order limiting their release. It is unclear how Der Spiegel obtained them.        

One shows a key defendant, Specialist Jeremy N. Morlock of Wasilla, Alaska, grinning as he lifts a corpse&rsquo;s head by the hair. Der Spiegel identified the body as that of Gul Mudin, whom Specialist Morlock claims to have killed with Pfc. Andrew H. Holmes in Kandahar Province. Another shows Private Holmes, of Boise, Idaho, lifting the same corpse by the hair.        

&ldquo;Today Der Spiegel published photographs depicting actions repugnant to us as human beings and contrary to the standards and values of the United States Army,&rdquo; the Army said in a statement released by Col. Thomas Collins. &ldquo;We apologize for the distress these photos cause.&rdquo;
