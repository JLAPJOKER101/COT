The plaintiffs suing Chevron for contaminating the Amazon rain forest appealed a court ruling ordering Chevron to pay over $9 billion in damages, saying Thursday that more money would be needed to clean up the mess. Meanwhile, lawyers for Chevron filed a 31-page request for clarification of the ruling, one of the largest environmental awards ever, which was issued Monday. James Craig, a company spokesman, said the filing &ldquo;has the same effect as an appeal in that it suspends the enforcement or execution of the verdict.&rdquo;
