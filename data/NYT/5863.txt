MOSCOW &mdash; Moscow&rsquo;s former mayor, Yuri M. Luzhkov, returned to Russia on Wednesday, ending speculation that he might remain abroad rather than submit to questioning in an embezzlement case against the Bank of Moscow.        

The bank is suspected of funneling money into the accounts of Mr. Luzhkov&rsquo;s billionaire wife while he was still mayor. Mr. Luzhkov is currently being treated as a witness in the case, though there has been heavy speculation that he could face charges.        

Speaking to the Interfax news agency upon his return, Mr. Luzhkov said that there were no legal grounds for charging him with any crime and said he was ready for investigators&rsquo; questions. &ldquo;I have always openly defended and will continue to defend my honor and the honor of my family,&rdquo; he said.
