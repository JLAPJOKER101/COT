MOSCOW &mdash; The Russian authorities announced Sunday that eight insurgents were killed in a large counterterrorism operation in the southern region of Dagestan.        

Government forces destroyed three bunkers where the militants stored weaponry, food and other supplies, a spokesman for the National Antiterrorism Committee told the Interfax news service.        

Images from the raid seen on Russian news broadcasts showed armored vehicles making their way through a rugged area in the foothills of the Caucasus Mountains and wisps of smoke rising out of dense woods. The firefight left one officer from Russia&rsquo;s Interior Ministry dead, and three soldiers from Dagestan&rsquo;s Interior Ministry wounded. Officials said they were working to identify the dead militants.        

Russian forces have spent years trying to extinguish the shadowy insurgent network in the North Caucasus, but they have been routinely frustrated by the militants&rsquo; ability to melt into the population.        

Earlier this spring, the authorities believed that airstrikes on a forest hide-out had killed the Chechen militant leader Doku Umarov, who has been linked to bloody attacks on central Russia. Recently, however, officials have acknowledged that DNA analysis showed Mr. Umarov was not among the men killed in those strikes.
