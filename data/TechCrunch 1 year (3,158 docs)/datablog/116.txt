Instagram has just announced 80 million users and a new app update; NoticeablyÂ missing in the update? The Find Your Friends on Twitter feature, which allowed users to follow the same people they follow on Twitter on Instagram.The Tweet Photo feature is still available.Weve learned that the feature is missing due to API restrictions from Twitters end, restrictions that possibly came about over concerns about Instagrams scale and its strain on data pulls.Many social apps like The Fancy and Foursquare still have access to this part of the Twitter API  it seems very likely that Instagram was the largest developer using the Twitter Friend Graph.The decision is especially perplexing for multiple reasons having to do with Valley politics: Twitter founder Jack Dorsey is also an investor in Instagram and the two companies share Benchmark as an investor. One could speculate that this is a competitive move on Twitters part, a direct attack on Facebooks social graph via limiting access to its recent acquisition (Instagram).Twitters agenda here isnt at all clear, but one possibility is that it wants to control the photos experience on its platform (and preclude Facebook from doing the same). Selectively limiting API access by company is definitely strange behavior in an ecosystem that thrives on API symbiosis. Imagine if Google just decided to shut off Google Maps access to apps randomly?Still, Facebook has done similar to Twitter in past years. For example, it blocked Twitters access to Facebooks in-app friend finder feature in June of 2010.Before this, Twitters most recent move in the API wars was pulling tweets off of LinkedIn, a decision that now seems like the beginning of a slippery slope.
