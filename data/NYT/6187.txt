Hundreds of police officers demonstrated in Tunis on Monday, complaining that they were scapegoats under the new government. The police, reviled for their role in enforcing the dictatorship of President Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali, have been accused of killing hundreds of demonstrators. The protesting officers said the 150 members of the security forces under arrest were not receiving fair trials.
