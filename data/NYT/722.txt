PARIS &mdash; Prime Minister Fran&ccedil;ois Fillon admitted on Tuesday that he had accepted free lodging and transportation for his family from the Egyptian government during a Christmas vacation. His statement came as the foreign minister, Mich&egrave;le Alliot-Marie, again refused to resign for accepting two free flights from a Tunisian businessman close to Tunisia&rsquo;s former first family.        

Mr. Fillon&rsquo;s admission was another embarrassment for President Nicolas Sarkozy, who had promised a government &ldquo;beyond reproach&rdquo; and who will go on television on Thursday night to answer questions from viewers.        

Mr. Fillon was responding to an article  by the satirical weekly Le Canard Encha&icirc;n&eacute;, which also broke the Alliot-Marie story. Ms. Alliot-Marie has been criticized for vacationing in Tunisia between Christmas and New Year&rsquo;s with her partner, also a government minister, as demonstrators there were already in the streets of some cities and some had died. Mr. Fillon was visiting a quiet Egypt at the invitation of the Egyptian authorities, and he had an official meeting there with President Hosni Mubarak.        

Mr. Mubarak then provided an Egyptian government plane to take Mr. Fillon and his family to Abu Simbel to see the temples and also provided a boat trip on the Nile River. The Fillon family was also &ldquo;lodged by the Egyptian authorities&rdquo; during their trip, from Dec. 26 to Jan. 2, Mr. Fillon&rsquo;s statement said.        

He and his family flew to Egypt on a French government plane with security, and Mr. Fillon paid the standard rate established by the French air force for private trips, he said, without specifying the amount. He also said that the prime minister&rsquo;s office had paid for the lodging of the plane&rsquo;s crew and the security detail, again standard practice.        

The Socialist Party has called for the resignation of Ms. Alliot-Marie &mdash; calls she has rejected &mdash; and on Tuesday she told Parliament that she would not resign and apologized for her &ldquo;clumsiness&rdquo; in accepting the flights. Mr. Sarkozy and Mr. Fillon have supported her, with Mr. Fillon calling the contretemps &ldquo;a very politicized polemic.&rdquo;        

Olivier Dartigolles, a Communist Party spokesman, said he now &ldquo;better understood the enthusiasm of Fran&ccedil;ois Fillon to fly to the aid&rdquo; of the foreign minister. Mr. Dartigolles said that after the scandal of &ldquo;Air Ben Ali,&rdquo; a reference to the ousted Tunisian president, Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali, &ldquo;here is &lsquo;Air Mubarak.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; He added, &ldquo;The spectacle of this government that believes everything is permitted has lasted too long.&rdquo;        

Jean-Marc Ayrault, head of the Socialist group in the National Assembly,  has  called for Ms. Alliot-Marie&rsquo;s resignation. Mr. Ayrault said  after the Fillon revelation: &ldquo;It is the authority of the state that is affected, and it is the president of the republic who is its guarantor. There is a crisis at the head of the state.&rdquo;        

But Andr&eacute; Vallini, a Socialist Party legislator, was more forgiving. &ldquo;If the prime minister has been invited by President Mubarak, during a day or two, I don&rsquo;t consider that as scandalous,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;This doesn&rsquo;t shock me enormously.&rdquo;
