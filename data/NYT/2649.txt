The Forbidden City&rsquo;s management group handed out registration forms last month for a luxury private club to be located in the compound&rsquo;s Jianfu Pavilion, which was restored with money from a fund in Hong Kong, according to a report in The Beijing News on Sunday and in the English-language edition of Global Times on Monday. Rumors about the club surfaced last week, when Rui Chenggang, an anchor for China Central Television, said on his microblog that the entry fee was one million renminbi, or about $154,000. Officials sent a statement to Global Times saying there were no plans to open any club.
