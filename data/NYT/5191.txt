MOSCOW &mdash; Two popular Russian rock musicians, disillusioned with the presidency of Dmitri A. Medvedev, have said they will not appear at concerts celebrating the presidential election next March, though they performed at a similar event nearly four years ago.        

Andrei Makarevich, the frontman of the long-popular band Mashina Vremeni (Time Machine), and Vladimir Shakhrin, of the group Chaif, told an interviewer from Radio Svoboda that they would refuse invitations if they received them.        

Mr. Makarevich said he had been &ldquo;incorrigibly na&iuml;ve&rdquo; to invest his hopes in Mr. Medvedev. Mr. Medvedev announced on Sept. 24 that he would not seek a second term, clearing the way for Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin to return for two six-year terms. The decision disappointed many liberal urbanites, who had hoped that Mr. Medvedev would remain and press for political reforms.        

&ldquo;We have already been told who would be our next president,&rdquo; Mr. Makarevich said. &ldquo;There is a feeling that we are being deprived of the remnants of our right to choose.&rdquo;        

In 2008, Mr. Makarevich and Mr. Shakhrin joined an array of musical stars at a lavish concert outside the Kremlin wall on the day of the election. Mr. Shakhrin said he now felt &ldquo;awkward&rdquo; about having taken part.        

&ldquo;We were just playing songs,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s our job. We were not pronouncing political slogans. But I have a feeling of awkwardness about my own role, as if I have some relationship to all of this.&rdquo;        

The leaders&rsquo; statement that the decision had been reached years ago &ldquo;almost killed me,&rdquo; Mr. Shakhrin said.        

&ldquo;I have an impression that the 2012 elections have already occurred,&rdquo; he said.
