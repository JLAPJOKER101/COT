Iran&rsquo;s intelligence chief has made a rare visit to Saudi Arabia, where on Monday he met the Saudi crown prince in an attempt to ease the strained relationship between Tehran and Riyadh, particularly after a suspected plot by the Iranian government to murder the Saudi ambassador in Washington. Diplomats said that Iran had requested the meeting and that Prince Nayef bin Abdel-Aziz al-Saud, also the interior minister, discussed regional issues, including developments in Syria and Bahrain, with the Iranian intelligence minister, Heydar Moslehi.
