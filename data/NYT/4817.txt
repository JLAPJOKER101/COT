The petition, signed by more than 175 organizations, also said Arab League members should support United Nations actions including a travel ban and the freezing of assets and should go even beyond those measures with an arms embargo. The lack of a unified Arab position against the Syrian government, unlike the reaction to the uprising in Libya, has helped block international action against Damascus.
