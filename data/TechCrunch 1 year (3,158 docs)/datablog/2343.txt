Exclusive - Boundary, a San Francisco startup developing a real-time network monitoring solution, has raised $4 million in Series A funding from Lightspeed Venture Partners, TechCrunch has learned. Boundarys monitoring-as-a-service offering aims to help dev-ops monitor networks and application traffic flow in real-time, both for public cloud environments like EC2 and private cloud datacenters.Boundary claims its SaaS-based networking monitoring service can be up and running in mere minutes, requires zero hardware probes, and is capable of processing millions of metrics per second.The Boundary platform, though a full-access API, will allows IT professionals to access streaming data and analytics for integration with Jenkins, Chef, Puppet and other existing processes.The company was co-founded by CEO Benjamin Black, who was previously responsible for design and implementation efforts for networking, security, and engineering of Amazons website and Amazon EC2.Boundarys other co-founder, Cliff Moon, was previously with Powerset where he worked on the design, implementation and operation of what ultimately became the foundation for the Bing search engine (Microsoft acquired Powerset back in 2008).
