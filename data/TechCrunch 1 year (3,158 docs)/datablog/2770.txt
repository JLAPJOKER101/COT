You can call T-Mobile a lot of things, but awesome at keeping secrets probably wouldnt be one of them. This morning at GigaOms Mobilize conference, T-Mobile announced details surrounding two phones: the HTC Amaze 4G (which was exhaustively leaked a few weeks back), and their version of the Samsung Galaxy S2 (which was announced, but not fully detailed, last month.)First up, the HTC Amaze 4G specs:Next, the company finally coughed up (some of) the goods regarding their Galaxy S2 variant. T-Mobile has been oddly hush-hush about this device up until now; they kept it powered down in a big glass box at Samsungs US SII announcement (whereas Sprint and AT&T were quick to demo theirs), and any questions as to what was inside were met with vague Well have more to say on that later responses.Heres what theyve disclosed for T-Mobiles Galaxy SII:This confirms the previous rumors that T-Mobiles SII will run on a 1.5 Ghz Qualcomm chipset, as opposed to the 1.2 Ghz Samsung-made chipset found in AT&Ts and Sprints models. Also of note: these two phones will be the first to run on T-Mobiles 42 megabit per second HSPA+ 42 network.Both phones will hit the shelves on October 12th, with the Amaze 4G setting you back $259.99 after a 2-year contract and a $50 mail-in rebate, while the SII will go for $229.99 on the same terms. For anyone keeping track: thats one week after Apple is rumored to be announcing the next iPhone and if history is any indication, these devices and the iPhone 5 may very well be launching in the same week. That should be interesting?
