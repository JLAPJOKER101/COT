PARIS (Reuters) &mdash; France&rsquo;s health minister called on Saturday for the authorities to find the chief executive of the breast implant maker accused of selling faulty prostheses to tens of thousands of women around the world, calling the growing scandal a &ldquo;shady business.&rdquo;        

The chief executive, Jean-Claude Mas, 72, the founder of the French company Poly Implants Proth&egrave;ses, has not been seen or heard from in public since the scandal broke, potentially affecting 300,000 women around the world.        

His company is accused of using substandard industrial silicone in some of its implants, which were sold globally before being taken off the market in 2010.        

&ldquo;It&rsquo;s obvious we have to find him and those who had an interest in this company,&rdquo; Health Minister Xavier Bertrand told Europe 1 radio on Saturday. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a shady business with lots of money involved.&rdquo;        

The company&rsquo;s lawyer has said that Mr. Mas and the company&rsquo;s chief financial officer were keeping silent &ldquo;out of decency and discretion&rdquo; but were still in southern France.
