The United Nations high commissioner for human rights, Navi Pillay, on Tuesday called on Zimbabwean authorities to release 45 activists charged with treason. A statement from her office said they were being held for &ldquo;discussing events in Egypt and Tunisia.&rdquo; She said the arrests violated the detainees&rsquo; rights to freedom of expression and assembly. The United Nations&rsquo; torture investigator, Juan E. M&eacute;ndez, said Monday that he had written to the government about allegations that the detainees had been beaten in custody.
