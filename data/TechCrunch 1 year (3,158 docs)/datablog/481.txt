What happens when you throw a bunch of startups, mentors, and wild college students on a boat for roughly four months? Its never been done before, so nobody knows.But on January 9, 2013, the first experimental Unreasonable at Sea accelerator class will leave San Diego aboard Semester at Seas MV Explorer (the fastest cruise-liner in the world) for a 14 country jaunt to test, deploy and scale 10 startups in international markets.The experiment for us is one in transnational entrepreneurship. How do we take a technology like an affordable nano technology from India, for example, thats already profitable and help them scale?, Â Daniel Epstein, founder of the Unreasonable Institute, told me. But more importantly were paying close attention to how a startup thinks about its technology and how theyve gone about developing it.This huge experiment is a joint effort between the Unreasonable Institute, Semester at Sea and George Kembel, Executive Director and co-founder of Stanfords d.school. The idea is to take 10 startups with two to three employees from each company on a 25,000 nautical mile journey to empower and educate entrepreneurs with the help of mentors to think about their technology on a scale that is globally empathetic and that actually meets the needs of the people.Ideally, this will allow those startups to build relationships at every port to help them navigate into those countries in a much more meaningful way, says Epstein. As a Semester at Sea alum, I realize the value in their mission and how it directly relates to entrepreneurship. I was exposed to different issues in different markets and thats what pushed me to take the Unreasonable Institute much more seriously.The inaugural Unreasonable at Sea class will journey west from San Diego with students apart of the Semester at Sea program for Asia stopping every two to four days and spending one to six days at each port to test their products and gather data in order to tweak and refine for the next stop.
