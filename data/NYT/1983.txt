Some 50 Taliban insurgents, including one who said he was a Taliban provincial leader, defected Monday to the government in Kandahar Province, which has long been a militant stronghold. The 50 men, armed with light and heavy machine guns, arrived at the government compound in Panjwai district carrying the white flag of the Taliban. &ldquo;I have realized that the government is not the puppet regime that I was told to fight against,&rdquo; said the group&rsquo;s leader, Maolawi Abdul Aziz. He said he had recently been appointed the shadow governor for Kunduz Province.
