In case you havent read through the 50 or so China posts on the site right now, the last day of our first international Disrupt conference will be starting at 9 am Beijing time/6 pm PST today. If you need even more reason to watch, catch Sarah and I above, talking about who were most excited about in todays lineup.And for some reason you cant make it to China this morning/afternoon, you can find the livestream here.
