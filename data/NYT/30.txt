BAGHDAD (AP) &mdash; Suspected insurgents killed four members of Iraq&rsquo;s security forces and a city engineer in separate attacks across the Iraqi capital on Sunday evening, officials said.        

The similar nature of the attacks  &mdash;  all were shootings by assailants armed with silencers  &mdash;  and the fact that they all occurred within less than an hour of one another suggested a coordinated campaign against security officials and government workers. There was no immediate claim of responsibility.        

Insurgents in Iraq frequently single out the country&rsquo;s security forces and government employees for attack, sometimes for retribution or to intimidate others from joining the security services.        

December was the least deadly month of the least deadly year in Iraq since the American-led invasion in 2003.        

According to Iraqi government data obtained by The Associated Press, 151 people were killed in insurgent attacks in December, the lowest monthly toll of the year.
