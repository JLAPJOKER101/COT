What does Q4 look like from a hiring perspective?A (SS): The top line revenue flowed through to the bottom line in the third quarter. We take a long term perspective on our business. In Q4, we are trying to pull in some of the 2012 hires. We are going to pull in 500-600 more employees especially in consumer products, technology, and sales. (JW) Well be able to manage this hypergrowth of employees. We wont hire folks that we arent capable of being productive from day one.Q: Mobile page views-what percent of pageviews are from mobile and how did that compare to Q3 last year?(SS) Mobile page views are north of ten percent of total pageviews, last year was immaterial. Q: How will mobile usage differ from usage on the desktop?(JW) We are trying to learn as much from mobile interaction as possible and leverage that into interactions.  Mobile is our fastest growing service and we are going to think next year about how we monetize mobile.Q: Any update on new product talent pipeline?(JW) It has yet to be rolled out officially, we will have pilot partners that will use the product in the next few weeks. Its the first step in making our recruiter product into a platformQ: You talked about an interesting growth area with students and recent graduates? What are the monetization opportunities there?(JW) Its consistent with the existing business model. There are nuances about that demographic, such as adjusting the profile so that it is unique for a student vs. someone who has been in the industry for a few years. We also rolled out the alumni product (mentioned above).Q: You mentioned record levels of engagement, can you expand on this? What impact do new products have on engagement?(SS) Were very pleased with the engagement this quarter, our page views are growing faster than our unique visitors. In terms of the financial impact, its much more directly correlated with online businesses.
