So the news on Google CEO Larry Page is that theres no new news. Thats what Nikesh Arora said on todays Googles earnings call.Just to recap: Last month, Google announced that Larry Page was skipping its I/O developer conference and the companys annual shareholder meeting because he had lost his voice at some point over the previous weeks. But whatever ailment caused that loss of voice over the last few weeks continue to ails him, as Page left the call to lieutenants Patrick Pichette, Nikesh Arora, and Susan Wojcicki.So heres the official update:Theres no new news on Larry, Arora said. Hes lost his voice and he cant do any speaking engagements, including this call. But Arora said that Larry is still running the company on a day-to-day basis, despite his inability to speak.
