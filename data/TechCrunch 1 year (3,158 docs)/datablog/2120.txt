Apple finally opened up its biggest store yet in Grand Central Terminal today. Since I was passing through, I decided to take a quick walkthrough with my iPhone. The results are the two videos and other images below.The store covers two balconies which wrap around a corner of Grand Central, with different products laid down on tables and taking up space in grottos towards the back of the balconies. There are a couple interior rooms you can go through as well, and you see the terminals huge chandeliers hanging out the window. It was jam-packed on opening day, filled mostly with gawkers. But I have a feeling this will become one of Apples highest-grossing stores just because of how many people go through Grand Central every day. You can get a feeling for the space by watching my jerky-cam videos below.
