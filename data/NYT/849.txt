Senator John Kerry traveled to Pakistan late on Monday to help defuse a diplomatic furor over the arrest of an American official accused of murder, White House and Senate officials said.  Senator  Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, planned to meet with senior Pakistani officials, and his visit was being coordinated with the White House. Tensions have been rising between the United States and Pakistan over the case of Raymond A. Davis, an American official who killed two motorcyclists in Lahore on Jan. 27 while driving his car. American Embassy officials say that Mr. Davis fired in self-defense when two armed men tried to rob him, but prosecutors in Pakistan have charged him with murder. American officials have insisted that he is protected by diplomatic immunity and should be released.
