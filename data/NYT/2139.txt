The police in Santiago have raided the home and offices of a lawyer representing a Roman Catholic priest found guilty by the Vatican of sexually molesting boys. The authorities seized documents related to the church case for a criminal investigation, a police spokeswoman, Lorena Quiroz, confirmed Tuesday. A judge ordered the raid after Juan Pablo Bulnes, the lawyer for the priest, the Rev. Fernando Karadima, above, refused to turn over documents. Mr. Bulnes on Tuesday called the action an &ldquo;abuse&rdquo; of his right to lawyer-client confidentiality. He said Chile&rsquo;s bar association has asked the Supreme Court to overturn the seizure. An appeals court voted last month to reopen a criminal case into charges of sexual abuse after the Vatican found Father Karadima guilty of abusing minors. The Vatican ordered the priest to retire to a &ldquo;life of prayer and penitence.&rdquo; He has appealed the Vatican&rsquo;s decision.
