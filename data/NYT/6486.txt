A 37-year-old woman was arrested on Thursday as part of an investigation into illegal payments to the police by employees of Rupert Murdoch&rsquo;s News of the World tabloid, &nbsp;Scotland Yard said Thursday.&nbsp;The British news media reported that the woman was Lucy Panton, a former crime editor for the tabloid. A report in The Guardian newspaper suggested that Ms. Panton was married to a Scotland Yard detective, and a public register of meetings with police officers shows that she and the newspaper&rsquo;s editor met with John Yates, a senior officer who subsequently resigned over links to The News of the World, in November 2009. A spokesman for the Metropolitan police declined to discuss the reports.&nbsp;The arrest is the seventh in the Scotland Yard inquiry into payments to officers.
