The United Nations atomic watchdog inspected a Syrian plant on Friday as part of a long-stalled investigation into suspected covert nuclear activity. An official of the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna said the inspection of the Homs facility in western Syria was &ldquo;being conducted as planned.&rdquo; Syria, which denies any nuclear weapons ambitions, agreed last month that agency inspectors could travel to the Homs acid purification plant, where uranium concentrates, or yellowcake, have been a by-product. The inspection is unlikely to resolve questions about any covert nuclear activity in Syria. Syria has refused to allow follow-up inspections at the remains of a complex at Dair Alzour, which Israel bombed to rubble in 2007 and which American intelligence reports said was a nascent North Korean-designed reactor intended to produce bomb fuel.
