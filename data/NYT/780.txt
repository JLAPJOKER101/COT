Islamists and opposition activists have created a political party in a rare challenge to the absolute monarchy, asking King Abdullah for a voice in the gulf Arab state&rsquo;s governance, its organizers said on Thursday. The move was more symbolic protest than a true opposition party because Saudi Arabia has no elected Parliament, and parties and public dissent are banned. Analysts said the group, Islamic Umma, included Islamists, human rights activists and lawyers.
