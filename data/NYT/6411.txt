Ballot-counting began on Sunday night in Ivory Coast, in the first legislative election in more than a decade. Results were most likely to shore up support for President Alassane Ouattara as he pushes to overhaul the cocoa industry.        

As many as 1,160 candidates vied for 255 National Assembly seats, with about 5.7 million voters eligible to cast ballots. The results will be announced by Sunday at the latest, the electoral commission leader, Youssouf Bakayoko, said on the commission&rsquo;s Web site.        

The party of former President Laurent Gbagbo, who is facing charges of crimes against humanity at the International Criminal Court, boycotted the vote. Mr. Gbagbo&rsquo;s refusal to accept defeat in a November 2010 presidential vote was the catalyst for five months of violence in which as many as 3,000 people died.        

Bert Koenders, the head of United Nations operations in the Ivory Coast, said in an e-mailed statement that the election took place &ldquo;in a positive and calm atmosphere.&rdquo;        

Mr. Ouattara, 69, wants to guarantee farmers as much as 60 percent of the international cocoa price to spur investment and output. Ivory Coast is the world&rsquo;s biggest producer of the chocolate ingredient. Those plans are part of wider reforms in the industry, which the International Monetary Fund requires before it considers debt relief for the West African nation.
