Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi won a confidence vote on an economic bill in the lower house on Tuesday, his first political success after his center-right coalition suffered defeats in local elections in May and in referendums last week. He also addressed the Senate on Tuesday, saying Italy&rsquo;s economic future depended on the longevity of his coalition, whose mandate expires in 2013. Rejecting opposition calls for his resignation, he said a government crisis &ldquo;would be madness&rdquo; when Italy needed to focus on growth.
