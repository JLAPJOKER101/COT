Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda, left, said the government would spend at least $13 billion to clean up vast areas contaminated by radiation from the world&rsquo;s worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl. In an interview with the public broadcaster NHK, Mr. Noda said the decontamination was &ldquo;a prerequisite for people to return to their homelands.&rdquo; About 80,000 people have been forced to leave their homes since the accident at the Daiichi nuclear power plant in Fukushima. So far, the government has raised $2.9 billion for the decontamination, Mr. Noda said, and plans to allocate a further $3.3 billion in the third extra budget it is set to formalize on Friday. He said more money would come in next year&rsquo;s budget.
