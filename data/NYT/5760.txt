A Canadian indicted in the United States on charges that he supplied Al Qaeda with weapons in Pakistan will not be extradited to the United States after Canada&rsquo;s Supreme Court refused to hear the case. The Canadian, Abdullah Khadr, had been arrested on a United States warrant in 2005. He was released last year after two provincial courts in Ontario suspended his extradition, ruling his rights had been violated during his detention in Pakistan. The Supreme Court did not give its reasons for deciding not to hear the case.
