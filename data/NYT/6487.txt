The British police said Thursday that they had seized computer equipment at a home in West Yorkshire as part of an investigation into the online dissemination of thousands of private e-mails from servers at the University of East Anglia in late 2009. Skeptics who challenge the science underlying global warming cited them to argue that scientists had distorted data to exaggerate the threat of global warming. Inquiries in Britain and the United States refuted that charge. The police in Norfolk said that no one was arrested in the operation, which was carried out on Wednesday. The e-mails were circulated on the eve of a United Nations climate change conference in Copenhagen in December 2009, apparently to undercut arguments that climate change required urgent international action. A similar conference under United Nations auspices ended on Sunday in Durban, South Africa, with a pledge to work toward a climate treaty in coming years and to establish a climate fund.&nbsp;
