Apple just released its second quarter financial numbers. Overall hardware sales decreased from its record previous quarter but with the notable exception of the iPods: theyre up from the same quarter a year ago. Apple sold 88% more iPhones in the quarter than it did during the same time last year.In addition to huge year-over-year increase of iPhone sales, iPad and Mac sales increased 188% and 7%, respectively. However, the iPod didnt fare so well: Sales are down 15% over last years quarter.“We’re thrilled with sales of over 35 million iPhones and almost 12 million iPads in the March quarter,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO said in a release statement today. “The new iPad is off to a great start, and across the year you’re going to see a lot more of the kind of innovation that only Apple can deliver.”These numbers are actually down from 1Q2012 where Apple shattered nearly all its previous records. In that period Apple sold 37.04M iPhones, 15.43M iPads, and 5.2M Macs. Even the iPad sold well with 15.4M units. But thanks to Apples offset financial quarters, this time period included the iPhone 4S launch and holiday sales. Even still, the 2Q2012 numbers are inline with analysts predictions. Apples two biggest products, the iPhone and the iPad, saw sales down just 5.3% and 23%, respectively.The iPod is clearly declining in popularity. The previous king of MP3s had a stellar previous quarter but thats likely because it still makes a great holiday gift. But now, during the barren winter and early spring months, sales slipped. Apple sold 1.32M less units during its second quarter than it did last year. Even still, Apple stated during its earning call today that the iPad holds a dominating 70% of the MP3 market share.
