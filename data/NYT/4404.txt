OTTAWA &mdash; A Boeing 737 crashed in Canada&rsquo;s high Arctic on Saturday, killing 12 of the 15 people on board, the government transportation agency said.        

The plane, owned by First Air, crashed about 1:30 p.m. while approaching Resolute Bay, Nunavut, for a landing, according to the agency, Transport Canada.        

Members of a large Canadian military contingent, who were in the area for an Arctic training exercise, rushed to the scene to put out fires and rescue survivors.        

CTV, a Canadian broadcaster, reported that two adults and one child were airlifted to a hospital in Iqaluit, Nunavut. One of the adults was reported to be in critical condition.        

Because the military intended to stage a mock airliner crash rescue on Monday, investigators were already in the community.
