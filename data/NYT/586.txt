The authorities on Tuesday started a crime-mapping Web site for England and Wales that lets users track what crimes have been committed on a street-by-street basis. In the hours after it began, the site reported traffic of 300,000 hits a minute. Site visitors can type in a street name or postcode to see the approximate locations of reported incidents broken down into six categories, including robbery, burglary, violent crime and car crime. The maps will be updated on a monthly basis and show which police officers are responsible for solving crime in each area.
