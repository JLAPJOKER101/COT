President Jacob Zuma made tackling staggering unemployment the government&rsquo;s top priority on Thursday. He announced $2.7 billion in tax breaks to encourage investment in manufacturing, and an additional $1.25 billion for job-creation undertakings, without offering specifics. The unemployment rate fell to 24 percent from 25.3 percent in the final quarter of 2010. When those who have given up looking for work are included, more than a third of the potential work force is jobless.
