So, Ive just recuperated from our VA mini meet-up tour, during which John and I visited DC, Norfolk, and Richmond in an attempt to find startup gems in unexpected corners of the country. This time were bringing things a little bit closer to home.Thats right New Yawkers: get your pitch in order, your demo up to snuff, and throw on your schmoozing hat! Were having a meet-up in the Big Apple, and if you arent there, youre probably shaped like a box.This isnt a seminar, panel, a conference, or really anything that requires people to sit down at a desk and look through a PowerPoint. Instead, John and I simply want to look upon your beautiful faces and hear about how you plan on disrupting the world through technology. Over beers.So this is the plan:Well meet on May 8 (thats a Tuesday) at Bar13, located at 35 East 13th St. and University Pl. The meet-up will begin promptly at 6pm and will end around 10pm, at which point we can all caravan to a bar for an after party.Theres just one little piece of business we need to attend to, before you go out and buy a brand new outfit.Were also looking for sponsors. The more the merrier (since that means more beer). If youre interested in a sponsorship, please send an email to john (at) techcrunch dot com with the subject: NY Meetup Sponsorship.To RSVP to the event, head over to our PlanCast page.Finally, if youd like to connect with us pre-show time, you can follow me on Twitter at @jordanrcrook or John at @johnbiggs.
