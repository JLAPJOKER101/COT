Egypt has prohibited the formation of a political party by Al Gamaa al-Islamiyya, an Islamist group that was once involved in a bloody insurgency against the government. Egypt&rsquo;s state news agency said the Political Parties&rsquo; Affairs Committee rejected the request because the proposed party would be based on &ldquo;religious grounds in violation of the law&rdquo; and advocated a strict interpretation of Islamic law under which thieves can be punished by cutting off their hands and murderers can be beheaded. Al Gamaa al-Islamiyya waged an insurrection in the 1990s but has since renounced violence.
