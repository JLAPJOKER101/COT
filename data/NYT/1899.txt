KAMPALA, Uganda &mdash; The government of Sudan accused Israel on Wednesday of carrying out a fatal airstrike on a car traveling from the Red Sea city of Port Sudan.        

Sudan is considered a transit point in the weapons route to Hamas, the Palestinian faction that runs Gaza. Israel has not yet responded to the accusation.        

Sudanese officials said a missile struck the car around 10 p.m. on Tuesday, obliterating the vehicle and killing two people who were inside.        

The Sudanese government said Wednesday that it was sure Israel was behind the attack and that it was prepared to take the issue to the United Nations Security Council, but officials did not specify what evidence they had.        

A Sudanese government spokesperson, Rabie Atti, called the missile strike an attack on sovereignty. &ldquo;This is piracy and should be stopped by the international community,&rdquo; he said.        

Israel has been suspected of launching an attack on Sudanese soil before. In 2009, American officials said Israeli warplanes had bombed a convoy of trucks near Port Sudan that was believed to be carrying arms to be smuggled into Gaza. At the time, Sudanese officials said that more than 100 people were killed.        

The Sudanese government did not identify the victims, saying only that one was Sudanese, and the other was &ldquo;Arab.&rdquo;
