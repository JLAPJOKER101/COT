Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi said on Wednesday that he was &ldquo;not worried&rdquo; about a judge&rsquo;s order that he face trial on charges he paid for sex with an under-age woman and abused his office to help release her from police detention for theft. In his first comments since the ruling on Tuesday, Mr. Berlusconi said he had the parliamentary majority needed to carry out judicial and economic reforms. At a news conference with Finance Minister Giulio Tremonti, Mr. Berlusconi barely mentioned the sex scandal: &ldquo;Out of love of my country, I won&rsquo;t talk about this. I can only say one thing: I&rsquo;m not worried at all.&rdquo; The center-left opposition is calling for early elections, and political analysts say the government is not likely to last long.
