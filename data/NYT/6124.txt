Trinidad and Tobago&rsquo;s prime minister said Thursday that the police had uncovered a plot to assassinate her and members of her government. The prime minister, Kamla Persad-Bissessar, gave no specifics of the alleged plot but indicated that it was a response by criminal groups to the state of emergency imposed by her government three months ago to dismantle gangs. Police Commissioner Dwayne Gibbs said about a dozen people had been detained.
