ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (Reuters) &mdash; Ivory Coast forces on Wednesday attacked fighters from a militia that had been allied with them in the fight against the former president, Laurent Gbagbo.        

The violence set back hopes of quickly restoring security and reviving the economy in the West African nation after a bloody postelection power struggle. The election was won by Alassane Ouattara, who took power last week; Mr. Gbagbo has been arrested.        

The attacks were reported by Ibrahim Coulibaly, the leader of the militia, which is known as the Invisible Commando. He said the Ivorian military had accused his forces of helping fighters loyal to the former president. A source close to the government confirmed the report, saying that some of Mr. Coulibaly&rsquo;s forces had not met a deadline to join the national army.        

Invisible Commando, which has an estimated 5,000 fighters, had fought alongside what is now the Ivorian Army, a ragtag group made up mostly of rebels from the 2002 civil war. The two groups have had little in common over the years beside their hatred of Mr. Gbagbo, and disagreements have been violent.        

Government security forces have also launched an offensive against Gbagbo loyalists who are holed up in Yopougon, a neighborhood in Abidjan, officials said.        

Yopougon residents reported intense fighting.        

Residents in other neighborhoods have cautiously returned to their daily lives after clashes throughout the city, which is Ivory Coast&rsquo;s commercial capital.
