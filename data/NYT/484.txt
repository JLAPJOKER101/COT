The incumbent leader Laurent Gbagbo, left, seized the nation&rsquo;s electric company and its distribution center on Thursday in his latest effort to maintain control of the country nearly two months after losing the presidential election. The national electricity company issued a statement saying that the government had taken over the distribution center, citing reasons of national security. On Wednesday, Mr. Gbagbo&rsquo;s allies took over the Ivory Coast offices of the Central Bank of West African States in an attempt to retain access to millions of dollars in state coffers. On Thursday, the bank protested the takeover and ordered its offices in the country closed until further notice.
