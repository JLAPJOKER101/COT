InternMatch, a 500 Startups-incubated company has raised $500,000 in funding from Netflix founder Marc Randolph, Roger Dickey, Angel Fund Social Leverage, 500 Startups and other investors. This brings InternMatchs funding to $900,000. InternMatch essentially helps connect students with internships. The platform attempts to do humanize the internship search process for students and allows small to medium sized businesses to recruit students who fit in with their business culture. The startup wants to replace the career fair for college students who want internships. On InternMatch’s platform, both internship seekers and employers can search for a match, receive skill and location based matching recommendations, and access tools to manage the application process (i.e. tips for resume creation, internship preparation, and more).For companies, InternMatch provides a match guarantee—if an employer doesn’t find an intern within 60 days, they get a full refund. The startup wants to set itself apart from competition by providing a dead simple UI where students can search and apply to positions easily. InternMatch has expanded nationally, and is launching a new product today—Community Pages. Basically Community Pages is a centralized place to help employers showcase their culture through content including video, photos, Q/A, social media feeds and more.  Community Pages offer employers the option of choosing either sophisticated candidate filtering or simple integration with existing Applicant Tracking Systems. And InternMatch is launching Community Pages with a number of well-known companies including Sequoia Capital, Pixar, AOL, Wikimedia, Yelp, AOL and others.
