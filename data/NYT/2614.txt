France&rsquo;s European affairs minister scolded the British government for an &ldquo;unfriendly and aggressive gesture&rdquo; on Friday, after Prime Minister David Cameron and his deputy, Nick Clegg, backed a move to phase out the French city of Strasbourg as the seat of the European Parliament. In March, European legislators approved a bill to reduce time spent by the Parliament at the official chamber in Strasbourg, and allow for more time at the administrative offices in Brussels, where they conduct most of their business. The French minister, Laurent Wauquiez, said he told his British counterpart, David Lidington, that European institutions should reside in a &ldquo;plurality&rdquo; of locations, as doing so &ldquo;reflects the diversity of the European Union.&rdquo; Mr. Wauquiez said that the bill ran contrary to European treaties, and that France would contest it before the European Court of Justice.
