Rescuers said Monday that it would be a miracle if they found anyone else alive after a drilling rig with 67 men on board sank Sunday in the icy seas off Russia&rsquo;s Far Eastern coast. Fourteen workers were rescued from the water immediately after the rig sank; rescuers later removed 10 bodies from the Sea of Okhotsk and know of 4 others, the Emergencies Ministry said, leaving 39 people missing.
