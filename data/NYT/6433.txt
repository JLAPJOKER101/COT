Israel on Monday closed a rickety footbridge leading to the holy compound revered by Jews as the Temple Mount and by Muslims as the Noble Sanctuary after a city engineer determined that the wooden walkway posed an immediate danger of fire or collapse. Though it is used only by non-Muslim visitors and Israeli security forces, Palestinian and Muslim authorities condemned the closing, calling it a provocation and a prelude to demolition and construction of a sturdier ramp. Palestinians object to Israel&rsquo;s carrying out any work at the site in Jerusalem&rsquo;s Old City on grounds that it is in occupied territory, captured by Israel from Jordan in the 1967 war. Any change in the status quo there has the potential to set off unrest. The bridge, known as the Mugrabi ramp, was erected as a temporary measure in 2004 after an older ramp collapsed. Muslims enter the compound, which houses Al Aksa Mosque, through different entrances.
