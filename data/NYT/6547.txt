Iranian state television broadcast video images on Sunday of a man who it said was a captured American spy sent to infiltrate Iran&rsquo;s intelligence services.        

The video report, also posted online, identifies the man as Amir Mirzaei Hekmati, an Iranian-American from Arizona, apparently in his late 20s. In the video, the man says he joined the United States Army after graduating from high school in 2001, served in Iraq and received training in languages and espionage.        

He said he was sent to Iran by the Central Intelligence Agency to try to gain the trust of the Iranian authorities by handing over information, some misleading and some accurate. If his first mission was successful, he said he was told, there would be more missions.        

The claims in the video could not immediately be verified. The C.I.A. declined to comment on the matter on Sunday.        

The Iranian Intelligence Ministry told reporters in Tehran that its agents spotted the man at Bagram Air Base, a major site for American-led coalition forces in Afghanistan, The Associated Press reported. The ministry said its agents kept track of him as he entered the country in August and arrested him when he tried to carry out his mission.        

Iranian television reports showed a card written in English that identified the bearer as an &ldquo;army contractor,&rdquo; The Associated Press reported.        

Iran frequently accuses the United States, other Western powers and Israel of spying, and it periodically announces that it has captured or executed people it says are spies. Usually few details are provided, and the assertions cannot be verified.
