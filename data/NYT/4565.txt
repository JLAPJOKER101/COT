Landslides killed at least 29 people on Monday in an eastern district of Uganda, including children buried in their homes, officials said. The bodies of 6 children and 13 others had been found, the Red Cross said, and the government said it had sent crews to help recover any remaining victims. The landslides occurred after heavy rainfall in the Bulambuli district, 167 miles east of Kampala.
