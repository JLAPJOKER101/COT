An attempt by armed forces from the semiautonomous region of Puntland to free a Danish family from a pirate gang failed Thursday, when the security forces were ambushed by pirates, a pirate and a Puntland official said. The soldiers tried to surround the village of Hul Anod, where the seven Danes are believed to be held, but were beaten back before they were in position. A senior Puntland official said that five soldiers were killed and vehicles were burned.
