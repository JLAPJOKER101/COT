Japan has granted a visa to Thaksin Shinawatra, the former prime minister of Thailand who was ousted from power by the Thai military in 2006 and who has lived in exile since a Thai court convicted him of corruption three years ago.        

The decision announced Monday by the Japanese government comes less than two weeks after Mr. Thaksin&rsquo;s younger sister, Yingluck Shinawatra, was named Thai prime minister.        

Ms. Yingluck has gone out of her way to play down any influence that her brother may exert on her administration, and she has deflected questions about amnesty for him. But Mr. Thaksin is widely believed to be playing a key role as adviser and kingmaker to the new government. He was also instrumental in the election victory of Ms. Yingluck and her party in July.        

The visa issue threatens to detract attention from Ms. Yingluck&rsquo;s economic agenda, which includes sharp rises in minimum wages and guaranteed prices for rice.        

Opposition politicians in Thailand criticized the issuance of the visa and described Mr. Thaksin as a fugitive from justice. Mr. Thaksin was stripped of his Thai passport by the previous government. He is believed to travel internationally with a passport issued by Montenegro, where he received citizenship last year.        

In issuing him a visa, Japan appears to have waived a rule that restricts foreigners with criminal records from entering the country.        

Surpong Tovijakchaikul, Thailand&rsquo;s new foreign minister, said Mr. Thaksin had requested the visa on his own. But Reuters quoted Yukio Edano, Japan&rsquo;s chief cabinet secretary, as saying that the Yingluck government had &ldquo;asked for our help&rdquo; in issuing the visa and that Japan took the step out of consideration for &ldquo;bilateral ties.&rdquo;        

Thai media reports say Mr. Thaksin plans to visit the areas of Japan that were hit by the earthquake and tsunami in March.
