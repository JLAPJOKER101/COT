A former Hungarian military officer has been charged with war crimes in the 1942 killing of more than 1,200 civilians in Serbia, prosecutors said Monday. The man, Sandor Kepiro, left, 96, is accused of participating in a raid by Hungarian forces on the northern Serbian town of Novi Sad, the Budapest Investigating Prosecutor&rsquo;s Office said.  The case was reopened after a Simon Wiesenthal Center researcher discovered his whereabouts in 2006. Mr. Kepiro, who lived for decades in Argentina, denied the charges and said wanted to return to his family there. &ldquo;I am innocent and need to be acquitted,&rdquo; Mr. Kepiro said. &ldquo;I am bedridden and can&rsquo;t leave my home. I have nothing.&rdquo;
