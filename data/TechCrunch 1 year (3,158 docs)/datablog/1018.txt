If you were wondering where all the PC growth was, look East, young person. IHS, formerly iSuppli, expects that desktop sales will rise 8% and Ultrabook sales will take up 15 to 20 percent of notebook shipments. Windows 8 and Intels Ivy Bridge are to be driving factors in PC growth this year.In comparison, IDC found that 2011 PC shipments shrank in Europe and the United States by 9%.Lenovo is still the number one PC maker in China, followed by Acer. HP has declined to fifth place with 5.3% market share.IHS doesnt really break out Apple sales vs. Windows but knowing the penchant for Made in Cupertino over there, I wouldnt be surprised if they were high on the list.“And amid a period of slowing PC sales growth worldwide, China’s consumers and businesses continue to generate healthy increases, said Elaine Zhi, IHS analyst.Enterprise around the world still hasnt hit the refresh button on their internal IT so its clear that things probably wont change much until after Windows 8 launches. Considering most machines made in the last six years can run just about any heavy duty app thrown at them  my own Mac Pro is from 2008 and it runs like a clock  theres little need to upgrade. That will change when Snow Lion obsoletes a number of Mac models while Windows 8 potentially forces a move toward touchscreen devices.
