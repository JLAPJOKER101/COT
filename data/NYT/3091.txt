Fighting continued on Tuesday between northern troops and soldiers aligned with the southern Sudanese in Kadugli, the capital of Southern Kordofan State, forcing about 400 foreigners to be evacuated, the United Nations said. At least six people were killed in the last two days, the United Nations said, adding that about 3,000 people had taken shelter at a nearby hospital on Monday night. Southern Kordofan is on the border between northern and southern Sudan, which is to declare its independence next month.
