A bomb exploded Wednesday at a hotel frequented by United Nations staff members in southern Lebanon, causing damage but no casualties, a Lebanese security official said. The official said the blast tore through the pub at the Queen Elissa Hotel in the port city of Tyre early in the morning. Another explosion minutes later damaged a liquor store in the city, also causing no casualties. There have been several attacks on peacekeepers in Lebanon in the past, but Andrea Tenenti, a spokesman for the United Nations peacekeeping force, said in a statement that &ldquo;there are no indications whatsoever&rdquo; that the soldiers were targeted by the hotel explosion.
