The rebel chief George Athor was killed Monday in a clash with soldiers of newly independent South Sudan, Vice President Riek Machar said on Tuesday. Mr. Athor died when a South Sudanese border patrol clashed with rebels in Morobo County, Mr. Machar said, adding that Mr. Athor had been on a drive to recruit other rebels in Central Equatoria State. Mr. Athor began his rebellion in April 2010 after complaining that electoral fraud had cheated him out of the governor&rsquo;s post in Jonglei State, an accusation Mr. Machar denied.
