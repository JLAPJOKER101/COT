A 14-year-old American accused of being an assassin for a drug cartel has been charged with homicide, prosecutors said late Wednesday. The boy, Edgar Jim&eacute;nez Lugo, confessed to killing four people whose beheaded bodies were hung from a bridge in Cuernavaca. Edgar and his sister, who was also arrested, were believed to have been working for Julio Padilla,  who authorities say has been fighting for control of the drug trade in Morelos State. Because he was charged as a juvenile, the boy, who was born in San Diego but grew up in Mexico, faces a maximum of three years in prison.
