Jamaica&rsquo;s main opposition party rode a wave of discontent with a bad economy to a big victory at the polls on Thursday, in elections that swept former Prime Minister Portia Simpson-Miller back into office. Preliminary official results showed Ms. Simpson-Miller&rsquo;s People&rsquo;s National Party, or P.N.P., winning 41 of the 63 parliamentary seats at stake in the national election. The results gave the Jamaica Labour Party, or J.L.P., of Prime Minister Andrew Holness just 22 seats. &ldquo;The people of Jamaica have spoken,&rdquo; Mr. Holness, 39, told reporters late on Thursday after calling Ms. Simpson-Miller to concede defeat.
