The Mexican Army said Wednesday that it had detained a man suspected in the shooting death of a United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent and the wounding of another on a Mexican highway last week. The detained man was identified as Juli&aacute;n Zapata Espinosa, known as El Piol&iacute;n, a leader of the Zetas gang in San Luis Potos&iacute;. The agents were ambushed and fired on as they drove from San Luis Potos&iacute; State to Mexico City. The motive was not clear but speculation has focused on a possible carjacking.
