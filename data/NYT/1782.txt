BEIJING &mdash; An Australian spy novelist and pro-democracy blogger who went missing in southern China on Sunday publicly resurfaced on Thursday night, speaking to a reporter for The Associated Press and posting messages on Twitter. The writer, Yang Hengjun, was most likely detained in secret by Chinese security officers, his supporters say.        

In a brief telephone conversation with The A. P., Mr. Yang, 46, said he was fine and would leave for Hong Kong on Saturday and then fly back to Australia. Mr. Yang is a former employee of the Chinese Foreign Ministry who moved to Australia years ago and began writing spy novels that have been published in Chinese on the Internet. His blogs are popular with Chinese readers.        

Mr. Yang did not say where he was on Thursday, The A.P. reported, although he was last known to be in the airport at Guangzhou, the southern provincial capital.        

&ldquo;I&rsquo;m O.K. right now,&rdquo; he said, The A.P. reported. &ldquo;Everything is O.K. I&rsquo;m just recovering. This trouble is caused by me.&rdquo;        

Mr. Yang also posted a message on Twitter. &ldquo;Due to personal reasons, on the night of March 27, I temporarily lost contact with family and friends for more than 50 hours, creating a great disturbance,&rdquo; he wrote in Chinese. &ldquo;I deeply apologize.&rdquo;        

In another message, Mr. Yang said the involvement of Australia, the United States and many friends had helped him recover from an &ldquo;illness,&rdquo; which appeared to be a code word for detention.
