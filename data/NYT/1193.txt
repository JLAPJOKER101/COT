Alan Gross, an American government contractor who went on trial in Havana on Friday, faces a possible 20-year sentence for &ldquo;acts against the integrity and independence&rdquo; of Cuba. The 61-year-old Maryland native was working for the Bethesda-based Development Associates International on a Usaid program that promotes democracy when he was arrested in December 2009. His family, and American and company officials, said he was bringing communications equipment to Cuba&rsquo;s 1,500-strong Jewish community. Cuban Jewish groups denied having anything to do with him. The trial, which is closed to the media, was expected to be over in a day or two, with a verdict announced immediately.
