The political opposition said Thursday that it had agreed on the lineup of an interim government with the party of the departing president, Ali Abdullah Saleh. The unity government would lead the country until the presidential election, scheduled for February. Despite the political progress, bloodshed continued. At least 12 civilians, government soldiers and anti-Saleh gunmen died overnight in Taiz, a hotbed of antigovernment demonstrations, residents and officials said.
