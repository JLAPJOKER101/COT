Bernard Squarcini, head of the state counterespionage agency, faces further investigation on charges that he broke press freedom laws by obtaining records of a reporter&rsquo;s calls in order to unmask a government mole, his lawyer said Monday. The lawyer said that the preliminary charges include violating secret correspondence and unlawfully collecting data. President Nicolas Sarkozy has denied asking the agency, the Central Directorate of Internal Intelligence, to investigate the source of information published in the newspaper Le Monde about political contributions made by the L&rsquo;Oreal heiress Liliane Bettencourt.
