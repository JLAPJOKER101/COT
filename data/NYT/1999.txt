CARACAS, Venezuela &mdash; Peruvian electoral officials said Monday that Ollanta Humala, a nationalist former military officer, looked set to compete in a presidential runoff election in June against Keiko Fujimori, the daughter of a former president jailed for human rights violations.        

Neither candidate managed to win the necessary majority in Sunday&rsquo;s first round of voting. With about 85.4 percent of the votes counted, Mr. Humala, who led a thwarted army rebellion in 2000, had 31.2 percent, compared with 23.2 percent for Ms. Fujimori, who ran on a platform advocating a pardon for her ailing father, Alberto K. Fujimori, 72.        

The results reflected festering resentment in Peru over the inability to more effectively close the country&rsquo;s yawning income gaps after years of rapid economic growth. Mr. Humala, 48, surged ahead of other candidates in recent weeks after advocating a more equitable distribution of proceeds from Peru&rsquo;s commodities exports.        

With the help of Brazilian campaign strategists, Mr. Humala also made his way into the second round after refurbishing his image into that of a moderate family man. It was a contrast to his image as a militaristic leftist in the mold of Hugo Ch&aacute;vez, the Venezuelan president, whom Mr. Humala admired during a failed bid for Peru&rsquo;s presidency in 2006.        

Ms. Fujimori, 35, meanwhile, emphasized her father&rsquo;s record in crushing leftist guerrilla groups in the 1990s &mdash; rather than the turbulent period marred by espionage scandals before he fled to Japan in 2000. He was extradited and returned to Peru from Chile in 2007 to stand trial on charges of corruption and human rights violations.        

Both defeated other candidates aligned with policies aimed at easing the entrance of foreign investment and persecuting abuses carried out during the long counterinsurgency against the Maoists of the Shining Path.
