SEOUL, South Korea &mdash; A South Korean court sentenced an American Army private to 10 years in prison on Tuesday for raping an 18-year-old South Korean woman, the most severe such ruling in almost 20 years.        

The soldier, Pfc. Kevin Flippin, 21, who is attached to the Army&rsquo;s Second Infantry Division, will have a week to appeal the sentence.        

Private Flippin was accused of breaking into the woman&rsquo;s residence in a low-budget motel on Sept. 24, repeatedly raping her and stealing 5,000 won, or $4.50. The American government had apologized to South Korea in connection with the case and swiftly handed over the soldier to South Korean authorities. Prosecutors demanded a sentence of 15 years in prison.        

&ldquo;While the defendant satisfied his sadistic and perverted sexual desire for three hours, the victim was forced to endure fear and shame at her own home, where she was entitled to have her peace,&rdquo; said a ruling written by Park In-sik, the presiding justice at the district court in Uijeongbu, north of Seoul.        

In 1992, an American soldier was sentenced to 15 years for raping and murdering a South Korean bar worker. That assault helped set off a prolonged civic campaign to demand greater South Korean jurisdiction over American service members involved in crimes and led to protests calling for the withdrawal of United States troops.        

Most South Koreans welcome the presence of the 28,000 American troops, whom they consider essential to their defense against North Korea. But crimes committed by American service members against South Koreans have often set off anti-American protests.        

The ruling on Tuesday came amid growing calls for harsher punishments for sexual crimes in general in South Korea. A recent series of sensational cases has prompted politicians and judges to support longer prison terms for offenders.
