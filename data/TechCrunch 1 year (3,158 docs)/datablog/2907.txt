Come celebrate in style with HTC, they say. Celebrate what?HTC has just begun to send out press invites for a mystery event in New York City on September 20th. Unlike Samsung, who tends to make it blatantly obvious what they plan to discuss, HTC is being a bit more cryptic here.Given the ambiguous nature of the invite, that HTC makes both Android handsets and Windows Phone 7 handsets (and a BREW handset from time to time), and that there are around a dozen rumored HTC handsets floating around at any given time (see: HTC Bliss, HTC Titan, HTC Amaze 4G, HTC Vigor), its tough to nail down exactly what they might have up their sleeve. With that said: we will, of course, be digging around for more info on what they might unveil. Be sure to let us know if you hear anything, wont you?
