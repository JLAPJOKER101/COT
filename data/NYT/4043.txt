The private investigator who went to prison for his role in the phone hacking scandal at The News of the World said Friday that he had acted on instructions from the newspaper.        

The investigator, Glenn Mulcaire, was imprisoned in 2007 after the British authorities discovered that he had gained access to voice mail messages on telephones belonging to members of the royal family and others who were the subjects of articles in The News of the World. Senior officials at the newspaper&rsquo;s parent company, News International, a British unit of the News Corporation, insisted for years that the hacking scandal was essentially limited to Mr. Mulcaire and a &ldquo;rogue&rdquo; reporter with whom he worked, Clive Goodman, who was also imprisoned.        

But on Friday, lawyers for Mr. Mulcaire released a statement in which they said that he had been &ldquo;effectively employed by News of the World&rdquo; and specifically acted on the instructions of others at the paper.        

&ldquo;Any suggestion that he acted in such matters unilaterally is untrue,&rdquo; the statement said. &ldquo;In the light of the ongoing police investigation, he cannot say any more.&rdquo;        

A phone call to the News Corporation seeking comment on Friday night was not immediately returned.
