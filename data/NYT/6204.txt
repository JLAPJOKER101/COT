The confessed mass killer Anders Behring Breivik belongs in psychiatric care instead of prison, prosecutors in Norway said Tuesday after an evaluation declared him legally insane during a bomb-and-shooting rampage that killed 77 people in July. The court-ordered assessment by two psychiatrists found that Mr. Breivik, 32, an anti-Muslim militant, was psychotic during the attacks. It will be reviewed by a forensic panel before the Oslo district court rules on his mental state.        

The conclusions contrasted with earlier comments by the head of the review panel, who said in late July that it was unlikely that Mr. Breivik would be declared insane because the attacks were so carefully planned and executed. But prosecutors insisted that the psychiatric report described a man living in a &ldquo;delusional universe,&rdquo; a paranoid schizophrenic who had lost touch with reality. Mr. Breivik&rsquo;s trial is scheduled to begin in April. If declared mentally fit and convicted of terrorism, he would face up to 21 years in prison, or an alternative custody arrangement that could keep him behind bars indefinitely. A prosecutor, Inga Bejer Engh, said that if the courts declared him insane, he would be given three-year terms of psychiatric care that could be extended.
