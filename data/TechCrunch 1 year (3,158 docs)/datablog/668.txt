The legend goes something like this: as a child, Twitter co-founder Jack Dorseys father would relentlessly hound him to Get better, so Jack eventually banned the phrase from being tweeted. Go ahead and try it, the tweet wont go through. But the legend? Its a hoax.See, way back when, Twitter wasnt a popular smart phone app, it was a way to publish up to 140 characters to the Internet via text message. To let people follow and unfollow each other, change their bio, and more straight from SMS, Twitter created a list of commands that when sent wouldnt be tweeted, but would trigger actions instead.So now when you tweet  get better, get [any single word], and several other phrases Twitter interprets them as SMS commands.If you want more to try, theres Fav [username] to favorite someones last tweet, and Suggest to receive recommendations of who to follow. Some of the commands still work from the web interface and smartphone apps. You can follow someone by tweeting follow joshconstine or just f [username without the @]. Others like the mysterious get command that spawned the rumor on StackExchange Skeptics which was busted by user DMI, dont work outside of SMS.Theres also no evidence Dorseys father ever told him to get better or aggressively pushed him to succeed. In fact, Mr. Dorsey senior sounds like a very cool dad who ran a pizza restaurant that inspired Jacks entrepreneurship, and helped Jack build a model of a mass spectrometer out of Legos, ball bearings, and magnets when he was 11 according to Fast Company.That doesnt mean the Twitter co-founder and Square CEO doesnt want you to get better, though. When Jack won an award for encouraging others to start their own business, he told the crowd “Don’t just expect the unexpected—BE the unexpected.”[Illustration by Wes Duvall for Fast Company]
