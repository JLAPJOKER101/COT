Judges at the International Criminal Court in The Hague dismissed charges on Friday against a Rwandan rebel accused of involvement in the murder, rape and torture of Congolese villagers by a Hutu militia in 2009. The judges ordered the release of the rebel, Callixte Mbarushimana, saying there was not enough evidence to support the charges against him. He had been accused of being a senior member of the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda, which is accused of carrying out savage attacks on civilians in the North and South Kivu Provinces of the Democratic Republic of Congo. Prosecutors said they would appeal.
