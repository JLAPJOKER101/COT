SHANGHAI &mdash; A Shanghai court has sentenced nearly two dozen government officials, construction workers and contractors to jail for their role in a high-rise fire here that killed 58 people and injured 71 last November.        

The highest-ranking official sentenced Tuesday was Gao Weizhong, the head of the construction authority in the district where the fire took place. He was sentenced to 16 years in prison for corruption and abuse of authority.        

The court said he had confessed to accepting bribes and steering construction contracts to unqualified subcontractors.        

Huang Peixin, the owner of a company that was subcontracted to do renovation work on the 28-story high-rise, was also sentenced to 16 years in prison for accepting bribes and for his role in the fire.        

Another construction company chief, Ma Yibang, was sentenced to 15 and a half years in prison for his role in the fire and for accepting more than $145,000 in bribes.        

The court tried 26 people in the case last month. The vast majority of them received jail terms.        

The fire was traced to workers who were welding using unsafe practices, and the netting and scaffolding encasing the building for the renovation caught fire. The fire led to a storm of criticism and anger because many older people and children were victims, and because fire trucks could reach only the lower floors of the building.
