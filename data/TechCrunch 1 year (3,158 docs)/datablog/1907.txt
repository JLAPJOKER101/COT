Steve Case, the co-founder of AOL (which owns TechCrunch blah blah blah) and founder of Revolution, was on The Colbert Report yesterday to get interrupted by host Stephen Colbert after every other word he spoke while attempting to explain the sharing economy to him and the audience. Fortunately for viewers, the interruptions were amusing, especially when Colbert lays out his vision for a new startup called Toasterster, which would enable New Yorkers to pick up and rent toasters at a central location and return them there after using it for the couple of minutes they need it for.He made the rookie mistake of not securing toasterster.com though (gone in 3, 2, 1 ).
