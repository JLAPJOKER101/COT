SANTIAGO, Chile &mdash; With his first trip to South America eclipsed by war and upheaval in the Middle East and North Africa, President Obama sought to connect the two in a speech here on Monday, calling Latin America a model for those trying to throw off dictatorships in favor of democracy and broadly shared economic growth.        

But at a news conference, he was asked by a Chilean journalist whether he also would &ldquo;ask for forgiveness&rdquo; on behalf of the United States for its part in the 1973 coup that brought Chile&rsquo;s former dictator, Gen. Augusto Pinochet, to power and for the &ldquo;open wounds&rdquo; that remain. Mr. Obama said that his administration would consider any requests for information as Chile seeks a truthful record of that period, but that neither country should be &ldquo;trapped by our history.&rdquo;        

Since that time, he added, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve seen extraordinary progress here in Chile, and that has not been impeded by the United States but, in fact, has been fully supported by the United States.&rdquo;        

&ldquo;So I can&rsquo;t speak to all of the policies of the past,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I can speak certainly to the policies of the present and the future.&rdquo;        

At his side for the news conference was Chile&rsquo;s president, Sebasti&aacute;n Pi&ntilde;era, who as a wealthy businessman had been close to the Pinochet regime. Mr. Pi&ntilde;era, in his own remarks at the news conference, said that in his private meeting with Mr. Obama, &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t go back into the past.&rdquo;        

Indeed, just as in his visit to Brazil over the weekend, Mr. Obama in his speech here &mdash; to an elite audience that included Mr. Pi&ntilde;era, three former Chilean presidents, government ministers and diplomatic officials from around the region &mdash; was forward-looking and upbeat in his assessment of the political and economic progress throughout Latin America, and of the region&rsquo;s growing economic ties with the United States. Those relations, he said, are now on an equal basis after a history of American paternalism.        

&ldquo;I know I&rsquo;m not the first president from the United States to pledge a new spirit of partnership with our Latin American neighbors,&rdquo; he said in a speech that advisers called the keynote address of his five-day, three-nation trip to the region. &ldquo;Words are easy, and I know that there have been times where perhaps the United States took this region for granted.&rdquo;        

&ldquo;Even now,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;I know our headlines are often dominated by events in other parts of the world.&rdquo; But, he added, &ldquo;The world must now recognize Latin America for the dynamic and growing region that it truly is.&rdquo;        

&ldquo;Virtually all of the people of Latin America have gone from living under dictatorships to living in democracies,&rdquo; he said, citing not only Chile, but also Mexico, Brazil, Costa Rica, Uruguay, Paraguay and his final stop, on Tuesday and Wednesday, El Salvador.        

Plainly tired after days of juggling public diplomacy with private deliberations about the military action in Libya, Mr. Obama said &ldquo;the lessons of Latin America&rdquo; could be &ldquo;a guide for people around the world who are beginning their own journeys toward democracy.&rdquo;        

&ldquo;There&rsquo;s so much Latin America can now share: how to build political parties and organize free elections, how to ensure peaceful transfers of power, how to navigate the winding paths of reform and reconciliation,&rdquo; he said.        

In pledging that the United States would be an equal partner in its relations with Latin America, Mr. Obama said that would, in turn, demand &ldquo;a sense of shared responsibility&rdquo; by the countries of Latin America.        

He cited several areas to improve cooperation: in fighting criminal gangs and traffickers in drugs, guns and illegal immigrants; improving education and cultural exchange programs; ending trade barriers; developing clean-energy projects; and combating climate change, which, as both presidents noted, has increased the melting of glaciers in the Andes Mountains.        

Mr. Obama also called on the nations in the hemisphere to support democratic rights. &ldquo;And, yes, that includes the people of Cuba,&rdquo; he said, raising a long-sore subject between the United States, which broke relations with Cuba a half-century ago, and Latin America, which is almost unanimous in opposing Washington&rsquo;s policy.        

Saying his administration had worked for greater openness with the Cuban people, Mr. Obama said, &ldquo;I will make this effort to try to break out of this history that&rsquo;s now lasted for longer than I&rsquo;ve been alive.&rdquo;        

But, he added, the Castro government &ldquo;must take some meaningful actions to respect the basic rights of their own people.&rdquo;        

In the United States, Mr. Obama rarely talks about Cuba policies, a volatile subject, particularly in vote-rich Florida with its influential anti-Castro Cuban-American population.        

Mr. Obama&rsquo;s generally optimistic assessment of the region&rsquo;s effort against drug trafficking was notable, considering that the death toll in Mexico&rsquo;s drug war, about 34,000 over the last four years, is rising, while drug consumption in the United States remains high. On both sides of the border, many people have come to see the counternarcotics effort as failing.
