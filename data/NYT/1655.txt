Two Iranian policemen were shot dead and three other people wounded in what the authorities said Friday were two terrorist attacks in Iran&rsquo;s Kurdistan Province near the border with Iraq, news agencies said. The shootings occurred in the city of Sanandaj on Thursday night. No group claimed responsibility for the attack. Security forces in the west of Iran often clash with guerrillas from PJAK, an offshoot of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which took up arms in 1984 for an autonomous homeland in southeast Turkey and shelters in Iraq&rsquo;s northeastern border provinces.
