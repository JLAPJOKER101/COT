Sorry RIM, but it looks like the promise of free apps and tech support werent enough to assuage the masses. According to the Financial Post, RIM is preparing to deal with a class action lawsuit filed on behalf of Canadian users affected by the companys widespread service outage.Filed in Quebec Superior Court by the Consumer Law Group, the complaint seeks compensation for all of RIMs customers that were unable to access their email, BlackBerry Messenger service (BBM), and/or Internet for the period of October 11 to 14, 2011.‚Äù RIM hasnt received the complaint yet, but representatives have said that the company will formally respond to the matter soon.The lawsuits lead complainant was an avid user who used his BlackBerry to communicate with his friends across the western hemisphere. According to the formula laid out in the complaint, he will only be able to collect $1.25 in damages from RIM  not much, but the payouts could quickly add up if the lawsuit picks up steam.  The amount of damages owed is calculated on a person by person basis, and accounts for how long a customer was left without service, so some users will net more than others.Its tough to put a finger on how much RIM may have to shell out here, as the company has avoided offering estimates of how many customers were affected. Still, co-CEO Jim Balsillie called the outage the biggest in the companys history in a recent conference call, so RIM could be looking at a sizable number customers itching for some restitution. Then again, of all the places struck by the outage, North America seemed to be affected the least. RIM may be able to pay off a few thousand customers and move on, but considering their luck, I doubt things will go that smoothly.Fans of legalese can find the full complaint reproduced below.
