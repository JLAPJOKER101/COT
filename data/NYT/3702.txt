A divisive annual celebration called &ldquo;The Twelfth&rdquo; got off to a violent start early on Tuesday with fighting in several parts of Belfast, Northern Ireland. Protestants kicked off the event by lighting scores of bonfires at midnight. Not long afterward, a crowd of 200 people in a section of west Belfast, a predominately Catholic neighborhood, threw firebombs, bricks and stones at police officers; the police were trying to prevent the crowd from reaching Protestants at the bonfires on the far side of a highway that bisects the city. On nearby Falls Road, people hijacked a bus at gunpoint and tried to drive it into a police line. The bus was crashed into a fence instead and then it was set on fire.
