The authorities pressed on Friday for a new investigation into the death of a Reuters cameraman, Hiro Muramoto, and 12 other civilians, who were shot and killed during political unrest in Bangkok last year; they said that Thai troops may have been involved in the shootings. The acknowledgment, in a statement by the Department of Special Investigation, marked a reversal from the determination by the agency&rsquo;s chief in February that it was not possible that the soldiers had shot the 13 civilians.
