A land mine explosion on Monday in southern Iraq and attacks on security forces in Baghdad killed 19 people. In southern Iraq, near Basra, six soldiers were killed as they tried to clear land mines. Later in the day, an improvised bomb exploded near security forces in western Baghdad, killing 13 people, including 3 security officers who were responding to an earlier explosion. No group claimed responsibility for the attack, but it appeared similar to others carried out by Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia.
