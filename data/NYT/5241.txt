SHANGHAI &mdash; The authorities here have punished 12 people for negligence over the subway accident last week that injured 290 people, according to Xinhua, the official Chinese new agency.        

The government dismissed the chief dispatcher of the Shanghai Metro&rsquo;s Line 10, on which the accident occurred, and disciplined 11 other managers and workers in the operation control and power sections. Xinhua said the penalties ranged from &ldquo;removing from job posts to demotions.&rdquo;        

The accident, in which one train rammed the rear of another, occurred on the afternoon of Sept. 27 after a power failure and signal system failure.        

After the power failure, Xinhua said, dispatchers &ldquo;issued a number of erroneous orders, which finally led to the crash.&rdquo;        

The crash created an uproar in Shanghai. That subway line, which only recently had been opened, has been plagued by problems. Worries are growing about transportation safety throughout the country.        

The accident was eerily similar to one on the high-speed rail network two months ago, when a train rear-ended another, killing 40 people and injuring nearly 200 near the eastern city of Wenzhou. The government&rsquo;s handling of that case sparked broad outrage and accusations that public officials had tried to hide information about the case.        

The government said that accident was also caused by signal failure, but it has not issued a definitive report on what went wrong.        

China&rsquo;s booming economy has been fueled in part by enormous spending on public works, including subway systems in the cities and the national high-speed rail network. But with those advances have come higher expectations of public service and greater accountability, in part because of an explosion of Internet use and microblogging.
