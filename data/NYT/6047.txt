BALI, Indonesia &mdash; President Obama had more than the usual spring in his step on Saturday as he bounded up the stairs into Air Force One for a 25-hour flight home after an eight-day Pacific spin.        

Certainly much of that buoyancy reflected his sense of diplomatic success, so far removed from the dead-end dysfunction waiting in Washington. The president, as his advisers saw it, had re-established the United States&rsquo; place as a Pacific power after a decade of distraction in the Middle East, convinced allies in Asia and Australia that the United States would, indeed, be a check on China&rsquo;s economic and military might, and helped throw Chinese leaders on the defensive.        

But the president&rsquo;s pleasure was personal, too. Each stop &mdash; Hawaii, Australia and Indonesia &mdash; took him to places he had known as a child and young man.        

As he said repeatedly, and again on departing, he had taken &ldquo;a trip down memory lane.&rdquo;        

The Spirit of Home        

In Hawaii, Mr. Obama publicly reveled in playing host to 20 presidents and prime ministers at a trade summit meeting in the city, Honolulu, where he was born and spent much of his youth until college &mdash; and where, as he wrote in his memoir, &ldquo;Dreams From My Father,&rdquo; he had grappled with his mixed-race heritage and life as an African-American in a population of Caucasians, Pacific Islanders and Asian-Americans.        

Both in opening the first Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum to be held in the United States since 1993, and in toasting the leaders at a torch-lit luau, Mr. Obama explained why he had chosen his birthplace for the event. &ldquo;I could not imagine a more fitting place,&rdquo; he said during his toast.        

&nbsp;&ldquo;Here, we are literally in the center of the Pacific,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;Here, we&rsquo;re reminded of the progress that&rsquo;s possible when people of different backgrounds and beliefs come together.&nbsp; This is the most diverse state in our nation, home to so many races and immigrants and Americans who trace their roots back to many of your countries.&rdquo;        

And &ldquo;the spirit of Hawaii,&rdquo; he said, is &ldquo;what made me who I am.&rdquo;        

The first lady, Michelle Obama, echoed her husband in welcoming the leaders&rsquo; spouses at a luncheon. &ldquo;Ever since I first met Barack, he&rsquo;s always talked about how growing up here, in this place, has shaped his character and his perspective,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And it&rsquo;s true. He is a very calm, focused individual, and much of that comes from his upbringing here and the connection to the community here as well.&rdquo;        

Once the summit meeting ended, Mr. Obama told local supporters at a fund-raiser, &ldquo;It is good to be home.&rdquo;        

The crowd, as he noted, included a friend of his parents during their short-lived marriage, Gov. Neil Abercrombie; former classmates and a teacher from the private school, Punahou, he attended on scholarships through high school; and a supporter who conveyed &ldquo;greetings from a guy who went to Kamehameha&rdquo; &mdash; a rival school &mdash; &ldquo;who said he blocked my shot into the bleachers.&rdquo;        

Mr. Obama also joked about his roots at an earlier forum with corporate executives, taking aim at the so-called birthers who doubt he was born in the United States and therefore believe he should not be president.        

&ldquo;As many of you know, this is my birthplace. I know that was contested for a while,&rdquo; he said, to laughter and applause. &ldquo;But I can actually show you the hospital if you want to go down there.&rdquo;        

Language Lessons        

In Australia, Mr. Obama&rsquo;s visit was his first as president; twice he had to cancel trips because of domestic demands. But as he reminded Australians at every chance, he had fond memories of coming twice as a child.        

At a joint news conference with Prime Minister Julia Gillard in Canberra, the capital, Mr. Obama recalled: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never forgotten the warmth and kindness that the Australian people extended to me when I was 6 and 8.&nbsp; And I can see that the Australian people have lost none of that warmth.&rdquo;        

In a speech to Parliament, he joked, &ldquo;As an 8-year-old, I couldn&rsquo;t always understand your foreign language,&rdquo; but, he added, &ldquo;to a young American boy, Australia and its people &mdash; your optimism, your easygoing ways, your irreverent sense of humor &mdash; all felt so familiar.&nbsp; It felt like home.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve always wanted to return.&rdquo;

At a dinner for Mr. Obama with Australia&rsquo;s elite, Ms. Gillard said he was popular with Australians because he embodied &ldquo;the American dream of opportunity,&rdquo; and because he drew from his upbringing &ldquo;a worldview that looks outwards rather than inwards, a state of mind that is inclusive rather than exclusive.&rdquo;        

From Canberra across the continent to Darwin, which will be the base for the expanded American military presence that Mr. Obama announced, the president sought laughs by salting his remarks with &ldquo;the Strine language,&rdquo; including expressions like &ldquo;G&rsquo;die,&rdquo; &ldquo;give it a burl&rdquo; (a try), &ldquo;a real chinwag&rdquo; (discussion) and &ldquo;ear-bashing&rdquo; (argument).        

Telling Australian soldiers in Darwin, &ldquo;I know that you all have a great Australian cheer,&rdquo; Mr. Obama added, &ldquo;so let me say first, Aussie! Aussie! Aussie!&rdquo;        

He pronounced it correctly: &ldquo;Auzzy.&rdquo;        

 Signs of Change        

In Indonesia for the East Asia Summit meeting on regional security and political issues, Mr. Obama returned to the tropical island, Bali, where he had retreated in 1993 to write his memoir. As a boy, from 6 to 10 years old, he had lived in the capital, Jakarta, while his mother worked for a Ford Foundation program.        

&ldquo;Let me say the obvious:&nbsp; It is wonderful to be back in Bali,&rdquo; he said before a private talk with the meeting&rsquo;s host, President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono of Indonesia. He added: &ldquo;I have to say, 18 years ago, this entire development did not exist.&nbsp; So it&rsquo;s a sign of the remarkable development that has taken place here.&rdquo;        

The language also seemed no longer so familiar to him.        

He had begun by saying &ldquo;Selamat malam.&rdquo; The White House translated that as &ldquo;good evening.&rdquo; But American Embassy staff members said it literally means &ldquo;good night&rdquo; &mdash; a greeting of departure, not arrival.
