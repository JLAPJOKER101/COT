China warned its Asian neighbors on Thursday to stop searching for oil near the Spratly Islands and vowed to assert its sovereignty over the potentially petroleum-rich territory. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re calling on other parties to stop searching for the possibility of exploiting resources in these areas where China has its claims,&rdquo; the Chinese ambassador to the Philippines, Liu Jianchao, said in Manila, adding that China was open to engaging other countries in joint oil and gas exploration. The island chain in the South China Sea is claimed wholly by China, Taiwan and Vietnam and partly by the Philippines, Malaysia and Brunei.
