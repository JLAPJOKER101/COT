The sentence of a Hong Kong political scientist who was jailed on espionage charges in 2001 after he was accused of giving secret documents to a South Korean scholar has been reduced by five months, an American human rights organization said Thursday.&nbsp; The researcher, Xu Zerong, was a senior fellow at the Guangdong Academy of Social Sciences when he was accused of illegally photocopying military documents from the Korean War and &ldquo;illegally providing intelligence to foreign entities.&rdquo; Mr. Xu said that he thought the five-decade-old documents had long since been declassified. The Dui Hua Foundation, a human rights group, said Mr. Xu had already served 10 years of a 13-year sentence and that with two previous reductions for good behavior, he could be released in June.
