The Galaxy Note from Samsung has been a tough one for us to figure out. Is it a phone? Is it a tablet? Wait! Is that a stylus?There was plenty to wonder about. But after spending quite a bit of time with the superphone, which you can relive with me here, John and I decided to chat out what all the fuss is about.The phone itself is solid, feels premium for the most part, and LTE makes Mr. Big Stuff over here super fast. The S-Pen is fun, but meh at best. Truth be told, the real issue is size. At 5.3-inches, its 1280800 HD Super AMOLED display poses benefits as well as problems.John and I discuss this and more, trying to figure out whether Samsungs huge marketing push for this thing is really worth the trouble.
