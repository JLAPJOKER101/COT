Oh, you think youre a hardcore Apple fan? Sure, you might have plastered the back window of your hybrid with Apple stickers. Yeah, youve got something MG Jobs said painted on the wall above your bed. Hell, you even named your first daughter McKenzie, just so you could call her Mac. But this guy milled his own iPhone 5 prototype, based on nothing but rumors and speculation. Just so he could see what it was like. Yeah. Bar raised.The project comes from the guys over at Germanys Benm.at. They began with some CAD designs, mockups that had been passed around, and the supposed case leaks weve seen so much of. They boiled all of that into a 3D model, which they then used to cook up their own design prototype. They milled it out of a single piece of aluminum, and even blasted the back with glass pearls to give it the same texture as the back of the iPad. Crazy, right? For obvious reasons (namely, that the guy isnt.. you know, Apples engineering team), the prototype is just for looks — it doesnt actually function in any way.Of course, odds are relatively good that the actual next iPhone — be it called the iPhone 4S, the iPhone 5, or whatever — wont look anything like this. For every Oh my god! Radical new design! rumor, theres a Nope, next iPhone looks exactly the same. rumor. The rumor mill has spewed out contradicting stories on even the most mundane of details. This prototype seems closely based on ThisIsMyNexts mockup that went around a few months ago; alas, just about every detail of that mockup has been negated by one rumor or another. Fortunately, we wont have to wait too much longer to see the real deal.
