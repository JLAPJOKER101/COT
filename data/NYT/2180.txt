The French police have exhumed five bodies from a freshly dug grave at a house in the northwestern city of Nantes. The remains were believed to be those of a family who lived in the house and disappeared almost three weeks ago. The discoveries began Thursday when investigators dug up a human leg from under a porch overlooking the family&rsquo;s backyard. The Nantes public prosecutor, Xavier Ronsin, said the bodies were believed to be those of Agn&egrave;s Dupont de Ligonn&egrave;s, 49, and her four children. The whereabouts of the father, Xavier Dupont de Ligonn&egrave;s, were unknown, the prosecutor added. Bullet wounds were found on the bodies. The entire family disappeared without trace in early April. Carcasses of the family&rsquo;s two dogs were also found.
