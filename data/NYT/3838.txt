Russian authorities have arrested four people suspected of planning a &ldquo;major&rdquo; terrorist attack in the Moscow region, Aleksandr Bortnikov, the head of Russia&rsquo;s domestic intelligence agency, said Monday. The suspects, who were arrested several days ago, were from Russia&rsquo;s North Caucasus, a violence-plagued, mostly Muslim region that is a hotbed of terrorist activity in Russia. Mr. Bortnikov said the suspects had planned to bomb transportation infrastructure and other crowded places, but did not provide further details. The police confiscated a homemade bomb with an estimated explosive force of 22 pounds of TNT, as well as other weapons and maps.
