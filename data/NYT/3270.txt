A former military chief of staff was arrested on Friday and accused of involvement in the killing of government opponents during Guatamala&rsquo;s 36-year civil war. Hector Mario Lopez, a retired general, is the highest-ranking former official to be arrested for massacres in the 1980s; he faces charges that include genocide and forced disappearance, which involves crimes in which the victim&rsquo;s body is not found.
