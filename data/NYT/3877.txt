The lower house of Parliament on Wednesday voted to lift the immunity of a lawmaker from Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi&rsquo;s People of Liberty party, allowing his arrest on corruption charges. The vote, by a secret ballot, was a blow to Mr. Berlusconi, showing that factions within his center-right coalition had gone against his wishes and voted to allow the arrest of the lawmaker, Alfonso Papa. Prosecutors in Naples have charged Mr. Papa with corruption, including the illegal dissemination of information protected by state secrecy in a complex scandal involving the trading of favors by people who prosecutors say are close to members of Mr. Berlusconi&rsquo;s cabinet. In another sign of government disarray, Mr. Berlusconi&rsquo;s coalition lost a vote in Parliament on Wednesday on a plan to resolve a garbage crisis in Naples.
