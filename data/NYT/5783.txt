A senior Indian government official accused Pakistan on Friday of backtracking since announcing Wednesday it had granted India most-favored nation trading status, exposing potential hurdles in efforts to improve relations between the two hostile neighbors. The official, speaking anonymously, said business and political lobbies in Pakistan seemed to have forced the trade move to be put on hold, leaving India to &ldquo;wait and watch&rdquo; to see if the process would resume. A spokeswoman for Pakistan&rsquo;s Foreign Office dismissed the accusation, saying, &ldquo;Pakistan&rsquo;s cabinet gave approval to move forward on M.F.N. status in principle.&rdquo;
