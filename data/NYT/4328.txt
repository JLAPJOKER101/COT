GAZA &mdash; A Palestinian militant was killed early Tuesday in an Israeli airstrike on Gaza that was mounted in response to rocket fire from the enclave, which is controlled by Hamas, a militant Palestinian political group.        

Another Palestinian man was shot dead on Tuesday at the Gaza Strip&rsquo;s eastern border with Israel, Palestinians said.        

The Israeli military said the airstrike hit a squad of men who were preparing to fire rockets at Israel.        

The man killed in the strike was identified by Hamas&rsquo;s military wing as Moussa Eshtiwi, 29; a Hamas official said two other men were wounded.        

A rocket fired from Gaza on Monday night landed near the Israeli city of Beersheba in the Negev Desert. It caused no damage or injuries.        

Militant groups in Gaza have refrained from claiming responsibility for recent rocket attacks, apparently to avoid open confrontation with Hamas, which is supposed to be enforcing an informal cease-fire with Israel.        

Other airstrikes damaged training sites used by Hamas and a smuggling tunnel beneath Gaza&rsquo;s border with Egypt.        

In the border shooting, medics evacuated the body of a 22-year-old man from a site near the border. Adham Abu Selmia, a medical official, said that the man had been struck by 10 bullets.        

An Israeli Army spokesman said that the soldiers fired at the Palestinian after he approached the border.        

Israel has created a 325-yard-wide buffer zone along its borders with Gaza.        

Meanwhile, the government of Hamas, which controls Gaza, said in a statement after its weekly meeting that it wanted to keep the situation calm and avoid any escalation with Israel.
