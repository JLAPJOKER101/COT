A new report put out today by PricewaterhouseCoopers lays out the tech M&A landscape.  Technology deals totaled $26 billion in the second quarter of 2011, slightly down from the $26.6 billion worth of deals in the first quarter, but up 6.7 percent from the same quarter a year ago.   These numbers include only deals closed in the quarter like Qualcomms $3.5 billion acquisition of Atheros and eBays $2.4 billion purchase of GSI Commerce, and do not include announced deals like Microsofts $8.5 billion purchase of Skype.In terms of deal volume, Internt deals made up 32 percent of the total, but semiconductor deals edged it out in terms of total dollar value, with $6.8 billion worth of chip deals closed in the quarter.  There were 82 total tech deals recorded in the quarter (based on data from Thomson Reuters), one deal above the amount during the first quarter and down from 95 deals the year before.  All in all, the M&A environment was flat, but remains healthy.Tech IPOs, on the other hand, are picking up with the LinkedIn, Pandora Yandex, and Freescale Semiconductor all hitting the public markets in the second quarter.  The $4.5 billion in tech IPOs accounted for almost 40 percent of the total IPO value during the quarter.
