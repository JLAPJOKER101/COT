MOSCOW &mdash; Ukraine&rsquo;s domestic intelligence service said Thursday that it had opened a new criminal case against the country&rsquo;s former prime minister, Yulia V. Tymoshenko, less than 48 hours after she was sentenced to seven years in prison in a trial that was widely believed to be politically motivated.        

The new charges come amid broad international condemnation over the persecution of Ms. Tymoshenko, and they are likely to darken hopes among her supporters that she could soon be released from prison.        

Ms. Tymoshenko stands accused under the new charges of reassigning $405 million in debt owed by a private energy company she headed in the 1990s to Ukraine&rsquo;s federal budget, Ivan Derevyanko, the head of the intelligence service, told reporters, according to the Interfax news agency.        

Investigators have also opened a case on the same charges against Pavlo Lazarenko, who was prime minister of Ukraine in the early 1990s and a mentor to Ms. Tymoshenko. He is serving a nine-year prison sentence in the United States for money laundering and other financial crimes.        

Ms. Tymoshenko&rsquo;s business activities in the 1990s have come under scrutiny before. In an era of no-holds-barred capitalism, she earned the unofficial title of Ukraine&rsquo;s &ldquo;gas princess&rdquo; for the dominant role she played in the country&rsquo;s energy sector.        

She was arrested and briefly jailed 10 years ago on corruption charges from her time as president of United Energy Systems of Ukraine, a company involved in the lucrative and often nefarious business of selling Russian natural gas to Ukraine. She also faced similar corruption charges in Russia. The charges were later dropped.        

Ms. Tymoshenko&rsquo;s lawyers said Thursday that they had not received official notification of the new charges.
