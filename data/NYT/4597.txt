PERUGIA, Italy &mdash; In the sweltering days of summer, the sun-scorched streets of this storied hilltop town echo with the indistinguishable conversations of world travelers here to explore its medieval and Renaissance palazzos or climb its steep alleys to catch a glimpse of the verdant Umbrian countryside.        

Edda Mellas would rather be anywhere else. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not here as a tourist; I&rsquo;m here to take care of Amanda,&rdquo; Ms. Mellas said on a recent muggy morning, sipping a glass of water in the cool comfort of a downtown cafe.        

For nearly four years, ever since her daughter, Amanda Knox, was jailed on charges of killing her 21-year-old British roommate, Ms. Mellas &mdash; who &ldquo;can&rsquo;t remember what life was like before Amanda got arrested&rdquo; &mdash; has grudgingly made Perugia a second home.        

&ldquo;Every summer, every Christmas holiday, every spring break, I&rsquo;m here,&rdquo; said Ms. Mellas, a teacher in Seattle. &ldquo;Hundreds of sick days accumulated over 25 years of work, now gone.&rdquo;        

With an appeals court expected to render a decision on the case in September, Ms. Mellas is hopeful that the ordeal may finally be coming to a close.        

Twice a week when she is here, she makes the hourlong authorized visits to the prison where Ms. Knox has been since Nov. 6, 2007. That was when she and her boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, an Italian, were arrested and accused of the murder, five days earlier, of a British exchange student, Meredith Kercher, during a sex game gone wrong. All three were students here.        

Since then, Ms. Mellas has been coming to Perugia to comfort her daughter, who appeared strikingly thin and wan during her last court appearance, on July 30. (&ldquo;She told us yesterday that she&rsquo;s on razor&rsquo;s edge,&rdquo; Ms. Mellas said during a five-hour interview in early August.)        

But she admitted to another aim &mdash; to use the insatiable news media appetite for this headline-grabbing tale as a pulpit from which to proclaim the innocence of her daughter.        

&ldquo;The media has been a curse, but it means that Amanda hasn&rsquo;t been forgotten; she&rsquo;s not rotting away,&rdquo; Ms. Mellas said. &ldquo;The day I don&rsquo;t have to speak to another reporter or do another interview can&rsquo;t happen soon enough. But if it means helping Amanda, then it&rsquo;s something I will continue to do.&rdquo;        

That includes challenging news media accounts of Ms. Knox as a party girl gone wild, an image frequently reinforced in the tabloid press by her childhood nickname &mdash; Foxy Knoxy &mdash; a tribute to her prowess on the soccer field, not the party scene. (&ldquo;Her jailhouse nickname is Bambi,&rdquo; Ms. Mellas said.)        

Ms. Knox, 24, and Mr. Sollecito, 27, were convicted in December 2009. She was sentenced to 26 years in prison, and he got 25 years. Both are appealing, and the appeals court is expected to reach a verdict in late September.        

Another man, Rudy Guede, 24, born in Ivory Coast but raised in Perugia, was also convicted in a separate trial and originally sentenced to 30 years &mdash; reduced to 16 on appeal &mdash; after his bloody palm print was found in Ms. Kercher&rsquo;s room and his DNA was found on her body and on objects belonging to her. The three were found guilty of participating in a drug-fueled sexual assault on Ms. Kercher that ended with her death. All have proclaimed their innocence.        

A salacious dramatization of the murder, along with pages of DNA analysis as well as other evidence &mdash; telephone printouts, computer logs, fluorescent bloodstain-revealing chemicals and a statement by Ms. Knox that investigators believe is compromising &mdash; is included in a 427-page report by the presiding judges explaining why the jury convicted the two former students.        

Ms. Mellas does not believe a word of it.        

&ldquo;People say, &lsquo;You&rsquo;re Amanda&rsquo;s mom, you&rsquo;d be saying that no matter what,&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; she said. But maternal loyalty goes hand in hand with her conviction that the prosecution&rsquo;s case is unsound. &ldquo;You love your kids, but no way would we fight the way we&rsquo;ve been fighting if there was evidence that she was guilty,&rdquo; Ms. Mellas said.

Earlier this summer, the family&rsquo;s case seemed to be bolstered by an independent forensic report saying that key pieces of DNA evidence used to tie Ms. Knox and Mr. Sollecito to the scene of the crime were unreliable and possibly contaminated. In an earlier hearing, a crucial prosecution witness who claims to have seen the couple near the house that night repeatedly contradicted himself.        

Defense lawyers say that the findings seriously undermine the prosecution&rsquo;s arguments, a claim that prosecutors reject.        

The DNA &ldquo;is just one element of the accusatory case,&rdquo; one prosecutor, Manuela Comodi, said in a telephone interview before leaving for her summer holidays. Apart from other physical elements tying the couple to the crime, &ldquo;other proof must be considered,&rdquo; she said, starting with their alibi and a break-in at the apartment that prosecutors believe was staged to deflect suspicion &ldquo;from someone who lived in the house, and that person could only be Amanda.&rdquo;        

So far, the trial has placed a considerable financial strain on the family. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t even know what financial hole we&rsquo;ve dug ourselves into, but I don&rsquo;t really care,&rdquo; Ms. Mellas said. Costs have been partly offset by a defense fund. Ms. Knox also won a $58,000 lawsuit last year against an Italian media company after a court ruled that her privacy had been violated by the publication of medical and personal information, though no money has changed hands while the suit is being appealed. The psychological and emotional upheaval has been equally trying.        

&ldquo;Our lives have been put on hold,&rdquo; said Chris Mellas, who married Ms. Knox&rsquo;s mother nine years ago.        

Curt Knox, Amanda&rsquo;s father, who was divorced from Ms. Mellas when Amanda was a small child, has also come here regularly, but work commitments have curtailed his presence. Last year, Madison Paxton, one of Amanda&rsquo;s closest friends, moved to Perugia from Seattle to be near her, and Amanda&rsquo;s younger sister Deanna has come several times.        

Both women left college so they could be free to travel.        

&ldquo;All kinds of people have been affected by her trial,&rdquo; said Mr. Mellas, who currently lives in an apartment in a small town in the Umbrian countryside, working in the computer field from home, learning &ldquo;menu Italian&rdquo; and occasionally going out for a beer with the locals. He, too, cannot wait to move back to Seattle. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had my fill of pasta and the fact that it can take six weeks to fix an ADSL line,&rdquo; he said, referring to a type of Internet line.        

But the sacrifices they have made in the past four years will have been worth it, they say, if they can take Ms. Knox home with them after the appeals trial.        

The police and prosecutors &ldquo;took a simple case and complicated it,&rdquo; Ms. Mellas said. She and most of Ms. Knox&rsquo;s supporters believe that Mr. Guede acted alone. &ldquo;Amanda got caught up in a perfect storm where mistakes were made. Once it got going, there was no way to put an end to it,&rdquo; she said.        

&ldquo;In the Dominique Strauss-Kahn case the prosecutors jumped to a conclusion, but then they stepped back, when things started not to add up,&rdquo; Ms. Mellas added, referring to the recently dropped sexual assault charges against the former managing director of the International Monetary Fund. &ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t they step back here?&rdquo;
