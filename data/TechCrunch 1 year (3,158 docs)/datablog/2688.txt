You may remember the one DRM to rule them all we heard about last year, UltraViolet. Its essentially a DRM scheme that all the heavy hitters are getting behind, from device makers to content creators to distributors. Everyone, that is, except for one 800-pound media gorilla: Apple.The last we heard of it was over a year ago, with nary a peep since then except the odd mention here or there and a more official debut at CES. But it seems that the sleeping giant wakes, as theyve opened up registration for UltraViolet accounts. Ive gone ahead and made one so you dont have to if you just want to see what it looks like in there.No, not a lot going on. Its basically an empty shell at the moment; no one knows what UltraViolet is, and no one has any devices that support it  or if they do, they dont care. Until more of the system is up and running, the functions and limitations will remain somewhat obscure. Im not enthused by the design, but well give them some time to tweak it before laying into them.One thing to note is the constant use of our instead of your. That doesnt mean them as in UltraViolet, but you as in you and your family and friends. The sharing of rights and permissions will be a key part of the scheme, though whether anyone will want to spend any time configuring rights lockers is doubtful.As soon as we start seeing devices and services that support UltraViolet, well give them a spin on the new management platform.
