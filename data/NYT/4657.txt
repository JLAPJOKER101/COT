JERUSALEM (AP) &mdash; Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel refused Sunday to apologize to Turkey for a deadly Israeli raid in 2010 on a Turkish-led flotilla that was trying to breach Israel&rsquo;s Gaza Strip blockade.        

The episode has battered a relationship once seen as a cornerstone of regional stability, and on Friday Turkey said it would expel the Israeli ambassador over the affair. In a statement on Friday, the prime minister&rsquo;s office repeated that Israel had expressed &ldquo;regret for the loss of life&rdquo; in the raid on the flotilla, but that it would not offer the full apology Turkey was asking for. It said its soldiers had acted in self-defense.        

Mr. Netanyahu, in his first public remarks since Turkey&rsquo;s announcement, expressed Israel&rsquo;s regret for the loss of nine lives in the raid and said he hoped to mend ties with Turkey.        

Turkey had asked that Israel apologize for the deaths and lift the embargo on Gaza, a Palestinian territory run by Hamas with a long history of deadly violence against Israel.        

Mr. Netanyahu said Israel, trying to keep arms from reaching Gaza, did nothing wrong. &ldquo;We need not apologize for acting to defend our civilians, our children and our communities,&rdquo; he said.        

The decision to expel the Israeli envoy from Turkey on Friday came after the leak of a United Nations report on the episode. It defended the embargo on Gaza and said activists on board had attacked the raiding naval commandos, but also accused Israel of using disproportionate force.
