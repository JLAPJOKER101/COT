The Mexican Navy said 32 bodies had been found in three houses in the city of Veracruz. The discoveries on Thursday came two weeks after gunmen dumped 35 bodies on a busy avenue outside Veracruz and a week after President Felipe Calder&oacute;n decided to deploy the federal police and security forces to the city. The navy said that Veracruz State agents had located the first 20 bodies inside a house in a residential neighborhood. A search in a house at another subdivision yielded 11 more bodies and the final body was found in a third house. The government has not said whether the crimes are drug related.
