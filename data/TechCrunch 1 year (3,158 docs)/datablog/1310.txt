The writing was on the wall for Flip, but when Cisco decided to shutter its rather popular Flip video camera business in April 2011, the company promised a smooth transition for existing users. That said, Givit video sharing service will be integrating with Flipshare, Flips online video sharing platform, to store the content that will soon be permanently deleted from Flipshare.Even though the iPhone completely disrupted Flips business, there are still more than 3 million Flip users out there in the world who need a place to store their videos. Givit aims to solve that problem through its cloud service.The content currently on Flipshare will be permanently deleted 30 days from now, but the service will be functional until December 30. That means any new content uploaded to Flipshare starting now will only have a 30-day lifespan. If you happen to be a Flip user, pay close attention. Heres what you need to do:Its actually really simple. The next time you log in to FlipShare, you should see a link asking if you are ready to transfer your content to Givit. Click that. The rest should be pretty self-explanatory.FlipShare users will also be pleased to know that Givit has iOS, Android, web, PC and Mac apps and is universally compatible with all video formats and sizes.
