Belarus sentenced two former presidential candidates to lengthy prison terms on Thursday for organizing a large protest against elections held in December that independent observers said were tainted by widespread fraud. The former Soviet republic&rsquo;s authoritarian president won the election. The two former candidates, Nikolai Statkevich and Dmitri Uss, received six and five-and-a-half year sentences, respectively. The convictions came a day after President Aleksandr G. Lukashenko suggested that he might free his political opponents, remarks broadly interpreted as a signal to the West that he might be willing to negotiate to secure a badly needed loan. But the convictions seemed to indicate the president&rsquo;s hard line would not soon soften.
