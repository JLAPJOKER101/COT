A Frenchwoman serving a 60-year sentence in Mexico for kidnapping lost her final appeal on Thursday, drawing a blistering response from France. The woman, Florence Cassez, left, has said she knew nothing about the kidnappings, which her boyfriend has confessed to. On appeal, she argued that the authorities violated several procedures, including staging her arrest for television. The court ruled that that had no impact on her conviction. In a statement, the French foreign minister, Mich&egrave;le Alliot-Marie, said justice had been denied, warning, &ldquo;This decision will weigh on our bilateral relations.&rdquo;
