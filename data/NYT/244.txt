A prosecutor charged five people on Friday with terrorism offenses related to the bombing of an electric company last year. The five &mdash; a 27-year-old German woman arrested in a northern Athens suburb on Friday and four Greek men, ages 21 to 23, arrested in the capital late on Thursday &mdash;are accused of belonging to an urban guerrilla group. The police have arrested more than 20 suspects tied to leftist and anarchist groups in the past two years as the authorities have tried to stem a string of attacks that have rocked the country since riots paralyzed Athens in December 2008.
