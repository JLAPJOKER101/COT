Even as a captured 2,370-pound, 20-foot saltwater crocodile was put on display in a town in the southern Philippines, the authorities said Tuesday that an even bigger crocodile might still be a threat. The captured animal, nicknamed Lolong, is to become the star attraction of an ecotourism park in Bunawan Township, where about 100 people pulled it from a creek by rope over the weekend and then hoisted it by crane onto a truck. Crocodiles are blamed for two deaths locally in the past two years. A wildlife official, Ronnie Sumiller, said another search was under way for a possibly larger crocodile that had been spotted nearby.
