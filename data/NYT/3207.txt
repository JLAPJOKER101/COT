A former Blackwater contractor has been sentenced to three years and one month in prison for the May 2009 shooting death of an unarmed Afghan civilian in Kabul. The contractor, Christopher Drotleff, was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in March. He and another contractor, Justin H. Cannon, who was also convicted, shot at a vehicle as it passed them near an accident on a dark road, killing the passenger and a man who was walking his dog. The contractors said they feared for their safety. Mr. Drotleff was sentenced in federal court in Norfolk, Va., on Tuesday for the passenger&rsquo;s death. The two men were acquitted of all other charges. Mr. Drotleff remains free while his lawyers appeal.
