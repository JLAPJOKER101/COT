Amnesty International on Friday condemned what it said was a sharp rise in beheadings in Saudi Arabia and urged the authorities there to halt executions. The human rights group said the kingdom had executed at least 27 people this year, equal to the total number put to death in 2010. Amnesty said more than 100 others were on death row, many of them foreigners.
