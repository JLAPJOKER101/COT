A trove of historic archive documents dating from Catherine the Great that were stolen after the Soviet breakup were returned to Russia on Friday by the United States. The 21 documents include decrees issued by Czar Nicholas II and Marshal Georgy Zhukov, a top-secret paper on the reconstruction of Russian military airfields in the 1930s, and Catherine the Great&rsquo;s decree to divide command of forces in Poland during the 18th-century partitions of the country. Russian officials alerted Washington about the documents when they appeared on Web sites of American auction houses. United States officials seized them between April and November, but no one has been charged with the theft, a United States Immigration and Customs EnforcementImmigration official said.
