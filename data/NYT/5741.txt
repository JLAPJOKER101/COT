An Istanbul court on Tuesday ordered the detention of more than 20 pro-Kurdish political activists, including a prominent political science professor and a leading human rights activist, on terrorism-related charges. The move was criticized by a pro-Kurdish political party and hundreds of intellectuals who issued a joint statement calling the arrests &ldquo;a heavy blow against the efforts to achieve real democracy within equality, peace, social justice, as well as academic and political freedoms.&rdquo; The suspects denied that they were members of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers&rsquo; Party, or P.K.K. The arrests come as a major military offensive in pursuit of Kurdish militants based in Iraq continues. The government has been debating constitutional changes to help the Kurds.
