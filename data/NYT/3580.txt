A prominent rights lawyer was sentenced to nine years in prison and barred from working as a lawyer for 10 years after he was convicted of seeking to overthrow the ruling system, the semiofficial ISNA news agency reported Monday. The lawyer, Mohammad Ali Dadkhah, a founder along with the Nobel Peace Prize laureate Shirin Ebadi of the Defenders of Human Rights Center, represented activists and opposition supporters arrested after the disputed 2009 presidential election. He said he would appeal.
