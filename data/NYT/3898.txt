MEXICO CITY (AP) &mdash; The Mexican attorney general&rsquo;s office said Thursday that 111 of its officials had been charged with fraud, embezzlement and abuse of power since April, and 192 others had been fired for botching investigations.        

Inspector General C&eacute;sar Alejandro Ch&aacute;vez said dozens of other agents and prosecutors were being investigated on criminal charges.        

The fired officials have been accused of carrying out illegal raids, receiving bribes and freeing suspects.        

Mr. Ch&aacute;vez said it was the largest purge at the agency since President Felipe Calder&oacute;n took office in December 2006 and declared a war on drug cartels.        

The sweep started in April when Marisela Morales was appointed attorney general, promising to fight internal corruption. She was formerly the top organized crime prosecutor.
