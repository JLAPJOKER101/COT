Apple CEO Tim Cook talked about the companys TV plans tonight at the D10 conference. His comments were all pretty vague, but if nothing else, he hinted strongly that Apple does in fact have plans for future TV products.When interviewers Walt Mossberg and Kara Swisher pressed Cook on whether he thinks the current Apple TV product is good enough, he said, Were going to keep pulling this string and see where it takes us. Mossberg then suggested that the current version of Apple TV doesnt solve all of the problems with TV watching, to which Cook replied, I agree — but he didnt want to talk about it further. Of course, a full-fledged Apple TV (one that includes an actual TV) has been rumored for a long time now, and this isnt the first time the companys executives have suggested that big plans in this area — but if nothing else, Cooks comments should chase any lingering doubts away.So what might this future TV product look like? Not surprisingly, Cook had no details to offer on a product that hes not quite ready to admit exists. He was willing to speak generally, saying that Apple is always looking for to control the key technology and make a significant contribution beyond what others have done in this area. He also said that Apple doesnt have any plans to rethink its plans for acquiring content, because getting content hasnt been an issue.As for the current model of the Apple TV, Cook said sales are picking up — Apple sold 2.8 million last year, and has already sold 2.7 this year.[I'm not the TechCrunch reporter at D this year, so thanks to AllThingsD, Engadget, and Twitter for keeping me up to speed.]
