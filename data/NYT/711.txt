Basque separatists started a new political party on Monday that they say rejects violence by the armed group ETA. ETA&rsquo;s political wing, Batasuna, was outlawed in 2003 on the grounds that it was part of the militant group. The new party, whose name was not yet announced, appears to be an effort to fill that void before Basque municipal elections in May. The Spanish government has said that Batasuna had to reject ETA in order to regain legal status and take part in politics.
