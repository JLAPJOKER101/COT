Former Twitter Chief Scientist Abdur Chowdhury is working on a new, super-stealthy project called Pushd. Details are scarce, but heres what we know: According to an SEC filing, hes teamed up with Summize co-founder Eric Jensen and the two have raised $1.35 million for the venture, which is based in New York City. Chowdhury joined Twitter with the companys 2008 acquisition of search engine Summize. He became Chief Scientist at Twitter, while Jensen became Twitters Tech Lead for Search and Relevance. Last fall, MG reported that Chowdhury, Jensen, and the rest of the Summize team left Twitter, amidst a high-profile shakeup of management at the social network. His resignation followed the departure of Twitter co-founder Biz Stone, as well as several key product guys and early employees. Around the same time, early, high-profile investors Fred Wilson and Bijan Sabet left Twitters board.So what exactly is Pushd? Its tough to say. The site is nothing but an email sign-up page for beta access to an unspecified service. Ive tried reaching out to Chowdhury for details, but so far have been unable to get ahold of him. Hopefully hell see this and, you know, give some more details about whatever neat stuff the team is building.
