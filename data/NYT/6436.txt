Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani and Interior Minister Rehman Malik denied that the government was holding peace talks with the Pakistani Taliban, according to media reports, dismissing a statement by the group&rsquo;s deputy commander on Saturday that the two sides were holding talks. &ldquo;Categorically, I&rsquo;m telling on behalf of the government, no dialogue,&rdquo; Mr. Malik told reporters in Islamabad. Mr. Gilani, in an interview with the BBC, left the door open to negotiations only if the Taliban disarmed and surrendered first.
