Brazil&rsquo;s army on Monday sent 700 soldiers to help desperate neighborhoods that have been cut off from food or water, or need help recovering bodies after the mudslides that killed hundreds in vacation towns north of Rio. Troops have already set up at least one bridge in the mountain vacation city of Teres&oacute;polis, officials said, but at least 10 main highways are blocked in an area where the slides hit, hampering efforts to move in the heavy machinery needed to begin large-scale cleanup efforts.        

Days of rain unleashed tons of earth, rock and torrents of water on Wednesday down steep mountainsides, directly into towns that are weekend getaways for the Rio area. The government has come under criticism for not alerting people. Local mayors have said they did not receive any warning a storm of that magnitude was about to hit. Rio state&rsquo;s Civil Defense department said Monday that the death toll had reached 655 between the cities of Teres&oacute;polis, Nova Friburgo, Petr&oacute;polis and Sumidour
