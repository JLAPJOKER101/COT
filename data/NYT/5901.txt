The president of Niger says his army has clashed more than once with arms traffickers from Libya, underlining the security threat posed by the fall of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi. The president, Mahamadou Issoufou, said Friday, &ldquo;We are very worried because this crisis will destabilize the whole region.&rdquo; Mr. Issoufou says a clash on Sunday that left one soldier and six traffickers dead was one of several. He says 13 captured traffickers are being interrogated to confirm their nationalities and determine where they were headed.        

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Also on Friday, Niger&rsquo;s minister of defense denied that his country had seized the dangerous surface-to-air missiles left behind by Colonel Qaddafi&rsquo;s retreating army, which military experts now fear are being sold to terrorist organizations that operate in the Sahel. &ldquo;We have not found any surface-to-air missiles yet,&rdquo; the minister, Mahamadou Karidio, said.
