The new MacBook Pro with Retina Display. Sure, it stands to fudge up the Internet, but boy is it pretty!The display boasts 5.1 million pixels, with a bump from 1440900 (on the 15-incher) to a full 28801800 resolution. It brings Apples laptops into the display big leagues with the iPhone and iPad, and gets a bit thinner to boot. Plus, youll get an HDMI port instead of that optical drive.But is the lofty price tag enough to replace your current MBP? The question can be answered in two parts: first, do you have the cash, and second, how much do you love the Internet?If your laptop is mostly for creating projects, etc. using Apples software, then the Retina display will change your whole perspective on pixels. If, however, youre mostly a web surfer, you may find yourself sourly disappointed by the resolution bump. The Internet, according to Biggs, looks fuzzy and will need to undergo a bit of a revamp to be where it should be on the new MacBook Pro.Then, of course, theres the price to contend with. With the 15-inch model starting at $2,200, this is, by far, one of the most expensive laptops on the market.
