Iraq&rsquo;s political leaders gave the government approval on Tuesday to begin negotiating a deal with the United States to keep American troops in the country after the end of the year to train Iraqi security forces. Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari said Iraq might still insist that the American military leave by the end of the year, as required under a 2008 security agreement. &ldquo;This is a politically highly charged issue, and there was division,&rdquo; Mr. Zebari said. &ldquo;But this meeting unified all the political leaders to back the government and start the negotiations.&rdquo;
