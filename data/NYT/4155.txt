ROME &mdash; Italy demanded on Friday that NATO investigate reports that an alliance warship failed to come to the aid of a boat full of migrants fleeing violence in Libya.        

Survivors from the boat, who were brought to the Italian island of Lampedusa on Thursday, reported that dozens of migrants had died from dehydration and lack of food during the crossing, which they said took almost a week.        

The reports that a NATO warship ignored distress calls from the boat came from the Italian news media, which cited unnamed sources. The boat was rescued by three Italian Coast Guard vessels and a helicopter.        

It was about 55 miles off Lampedusa when it was found with 370 people on board. Italian news organizations said the migrants reported that at least 30 other passengers, most of them women, had died during the crossing and had been thrown overboard.        

Flavio Di Giacomo, a spokesman in Italy for the International Organization for Migration, said the migrants had told him the same story, although some said the number of people who died was much higher.        

No bodies had been found, the Italian Coast Guard said.        

NATO said in a statement that its maritime command was informed by the Italian authorities of a &ldquo;distress call of a ship&rdquo; on Thursday and that the authorities subsequently said they had sent rescuers.        

The statement said that &ldquo;facts of the incident are still emerging.&rdquo; NATO, it said, has a &ldquo;longstanding commitment to render assistance in emergency situations at sea.&rdquo;        

The migration organization responded to the reports by saying that any boat leaving Libya should be considered a vessel in need of assistance.        

&ldquo;In the light of the number of migrants currently leaving Libya, we need to reinforce the search and rescue procedures at sea,&rdquo; Mr. Di Giacomo said. &ldquo;We need to work all together.&rdquo;
