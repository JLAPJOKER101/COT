The former army chief Sarath Fonseka was sentenced Friday to three more years in prison for reportedly implicating the defense secretary in war crimes at the end of the country&rsquo;s civil war. Two judges of a three-member High Court ruled that his comments reported by a newspaper in 2009 breached the emergency laws. Mr. Fonseka said he had been misquoted. He called the decision unjust but not surprising because the government wanted to keep him out of politics. His lawyer said he would appeal. The sentence would come on top of the 30 months he had been given for fraud.
