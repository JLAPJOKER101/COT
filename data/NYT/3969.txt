At least 78 people died when a military plane crashed in a mountainous region of southern Morocco on Tuesday, the official MAP news agency reported, in one of the country&rsquo;s worst air disasters. Three people were reported to have survived with severe injuries.        

The plane, a C-130 used for troop transport, belonged to Morocco&rsquo;s Royal Armed Forces was carrying 60 members of the Moroccan military, 12 civilians and 9 crew members when it slammed into a mountain about five miles from the city of Guelmim, state media reported. Inclement weather and fog in the area of the crash are believed to have been a factor.        

The crash site was less than 100 miles from the disputed territory of Western Sahara, where the government has clashed with separatists for decades.        

The crash was among the worst plane crashes in Morocco in nearly two decades. In 1994, 44 people died when a Moroccan airliner crashed en route from the southern seaside resort of Agadir to Casablanca.
