Rescuers used shovels and bare hands Monday to dig out miners buried after a gas explosion in a coal mine in southwestern Pakistan, lining up wooden caskets to await the bodies from an accident that left 52 people feared dead. By Monday, 27 bodies had been recovered since the accident on Sunday, but an official said &ldquo;there is zero percent chance&rdquo; anyone would come out alive. A government inspector said that the mine had been declared dangerous two weeks ago because of the presence of methane gas but that the contractor ignored the warning.
