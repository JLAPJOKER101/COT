Six months after the second cohort launched, the ex-Googler fueled AngelPad is ready to have at it again with a third brood of 11 business Internet-focused, technology driven companies. A little over a year into its existence, AngelPad has launched 22 companies, 19 of which have raised money and one of which was acquired.At AngelPad we deliberately work with a highly selected small number of companies, says founder Thomas Korte. Last session, we selected 15 out of 2000 applications. That allows us to give them a lot of attention and intensively mentor them on all aspects of early stage startup: the idea, the product and product-market-fit. Through the process we put a bit of Google DNA in every company and the result is a dramatically shorter cycle from idea to product market fit and even to revenue.In addition to Google DNA pedigreed mentorship and support, being an AngelPad startup means that you have access to an initial $20,000 in funding, and an additional $100,000 from two mystery VC firms who have StartFund-level faith in Korte and crews startup taste.You can find a brief description of each of the presenters today, below.SourceNinjaIn the same space as Sonatype, SourceNinja goes beyond Java as a language agnostic open-source management platform. In addition, SourceNinja also tells you what a software update contains, on top of alerting customers that a new version exists. We provide all of the information necessary that a developer or manager would need when deciding whether or not to upgrade, founder Matthew Stump tells me. [We want] to establish ourselves as the company organizations go to for help using open source across the enterprise, Stump says.SimpleReachSimpleReach offers site tools for online publishers. Their current product The Slide offers up content recommendations for site visitors a la SailThru. Founder Edward Kim tells me that what sets his product apart from SailThrough is the breadth of SimpleReachs network and its performance. In addition, Kim is working on a SimpleReach Intelligence product, a social analytics dashboard that gives publishers and bloggers in-depth insight into story performance across social media (like tracking recurring patterns in stories that received the most Likes, for example). Kim is keeping the details it reveals about Intelligence sparse for now, but I interacted with it briefly and it looks like nothing else out there currently.LendFriendMaking it easier for people to borrow money from their friends and family, LendFriend is targeting the younger and pre-credit market as well as people who have below prime credit scores. The company provides all the loan accoutrements for its customers, including legal, e-signature, payments, tax, and regulatory guidance. LendFriend compartmentalizes the emotional aspect that people have when money is involved with relationships, founder Geno Moscetti says. Thus far the company has managed between $2-$3 million in loans, with the average loan starting at $15,000.  Typically friends and family are the lender of last resort, but we envision a world where people look first to their friends and family to reach their financial goals, as the lender of first resort.PipeDrivePipeDrive wants to simplify business software, by creating a simple way for a company to manage its sales pipeline. Founder Timo Rein sees the companys closest competitors as Excel spreadsheets, analog pen and paper and Post-It Notes, Its very hard to scale these across organization, he says So, we are building the post-it note and spreadsheet level experience into a software that scales.  Already boasting 330 paying customers in over 24 countries, Rein eventually sees every business using PipeDrive to manage its dealmaking process.FrugaloFrugalo is a daily deals aggregation platform that uses Facebook and inbox
integration to unearth the most relevant deals for its users, importing deals from both channels as well as notifying you when they expire.  Right now the social commerce network is focused on the daily deals space, CEO Mike Cieri tells me, but the company plans on expanding to flash sales sites, member only sites and brand retail offers post-launch.IDoneThis IDoneThis is a motivational email service that asks you, via email, “What’d you get done today?” and expects an email response in list form, every day. IDoneThis CEO Walter Chen holds that his product is in the same space as productivity tools Rypple and Yammer, and that users are loving it. He tells me that 25% of their active users use it every day  one member used it to propose to his fiance, and his co-founder used it to lose 15 pounds.PrizzmPrizzm is built on the premise that CRM doesnt work for social media, because Twitter and Facebook mean that customers can say whatever they want when they want about your brand. By rewarding customers with exchangeable loyalty points for interacting with and giving feedback to a brand, Prizzm wants to shift the CRM power balance. If customers own their data instead of companies, it is much more powerful, says CEO Charles Oppenheimer.BufferIn the same space as Time.ly, Buffer allows users to optimally time their social media(namely Twitter) updates. Built upon the belief that one day social traffic will trump search traffic, Buffer has just hit 50K users with almost 2 million tweets so far.

Wishery wants to get that data out of silos, and make it useful for both customers and companies.ShoplogicIn the same space as Runa, promotions management platform Shoplogic uses customer interaction and purchase data in order to help merchants be smarter about their promotions. There is a shift in consumer mentality where shoppers expect to see promotions and discounts, says CTO Dennis Maskevitch, who holds that shift means increased pressure for merchants. He hopes that by using Shoplogic to target those promotions, merchants will be able to alleviate some of that pressure.LikeAndyA Dropbox for videos LikeAndy is a mobile app video that lets people distribute their videos across multiple devices. Taking its name inspiration from Andy Warhols fifteen minutes of fame concept, LikeAndys target market is people who want their own fifteen minutes, and express that desire by sharing personal videos. What the company does differently from competitors (eh, hem YouTube) is that it contains a unique heat/interest mapping technology that lets people find the most interesting moments in their videos.StorieStorie goes beyond photosharing apps and attempts to tell a story with photos, using a novel UI to create an experience similar to a photo scrapbook. Stories created in Storie can be shared through various social networks, as well as embedded on a website. Using Storie should be like browsing a lifestyle magazine or a local newspaper, says founder Kuan Yong, Full of engaging human interest stories with the occasional how-to article.

The Storie community determines popularity and visibility of items.TapvivaTapviva wants to disrupt traditional restaurant Point of Sale systems by letting users pay via their iPhone and Android smartphones.

By using Kout a seller can reach customers through Twitter and Facebook, their own blogs, and wherever one can use links, directing them to a personalized payment platform. Kout also provides merchants with social analytics, enabling them to gather data on where a potential customer comes in from. Most platforms dont combine eCommerce and payments. We do, says Kout founder Hany Rashwan.VungleOne of the biggest problems with app stores is that it is difficult to know whats in (and for that matter return) a given app. Mobile marketing app Vungle tries to somewhat solves this problem, by letting apps market themselves through its 15 second videos and advertising network. Vungles 15 second trailers for apps let users explore an apps features before buying, resulting in four times as many installs, according to the Vungle founders.
