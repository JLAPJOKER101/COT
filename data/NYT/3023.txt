Eman al-Obeidy, a Libyan woman who became a symbol of resistance when she said she had been raped and beaten by Qaddafi militiamen, told CNN on Friday that she had been beaten again, this time by officers of the government of Qatar, who deported her Thursday to the rebel stronghold of Benghazi. The reason for her deportation was unclear, and Qatari officials could not be reached for comment.
