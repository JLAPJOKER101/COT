Zimbabwean authorities on Wednesday charged a total of 45 students, trade unionists and activists with treason, accusing them of watching news videos of the uprising in Egypt and plotting to topple Zimbabwe&rsquo;s autocratic president, Robert Mugabe, 87, who has been in power since 1980. If convicted, they face sentences of life in prison or death. Human rights lawyers say the accused are innocent and were merely engaged in an academic discussion about events in Egypt.
