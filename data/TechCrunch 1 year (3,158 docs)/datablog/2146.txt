Back in October — after many months of speculation and rumors — Facebook launched its long-anticipated iPad application. The app was notable for two reasons: first, it was the first time the social network offered an official app for Apples tablet, and second, because it included an overhauled UI for Facebooks immensely popular iPhone app as well.Improvements include persistent messages and notifications on the top of the screen, and a nav bar thats accessible from nearly anywhere within the app (you dont have to keep jumping back to the Home screen to access your Messages, Events, and so on, as you used to).Now Facebook appears to have brought the same improvements to its Android application, with an update that will soon be rolling out. The update isnt showing up for me on Android Market yet, so I havent been able to try it out, but based on screenshots in Facebooks announcement it strongly resembles the iOS applications. When it does go live on Market, youll be able to download it right here.Facebooks blog post also says that photos are up to twice as fast in the new version of the Android app.One other thing to look for: yesterday Engadget posted leaked screenshots of (what appears to be) this update. The Engadget photos also show a standalone Facebook Nearby app, which Facebooks blog post today does not mention — its unclear if this is a different app that hasnt been released, or if it will be offered alongside todays update.
