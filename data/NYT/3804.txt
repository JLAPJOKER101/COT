S&Atilde;O PAULO, Brazil &mdash; President Hugo Ch&aacute;vez of Venezuela boarded a plane bound for Cuba on Saturday to receive more treatment for a cancer whose details still remain a mystery to the outside world.        

Just one day after reports were swirling that Mr. Ch&aacute;vez was headed here to S&atilde;o Paulo for chemotherapy treatment at one of the most renowned cancer-treatment hospitals in Latin America, the Venezuelan leader announced late Friday that he was flying to Cuba instead. That choice underscored Mr. Ch&aacute;vez&rsquo;s unyielding faith in Cuba&rsquo;s leader, Fidel Castro, even in a possible fight for his life and the legacy of his 12-year-rule in Venezuela.        

&ldquo;For Ch&aacute;vez, questions of trust, political loyalty and control trump all other considerations,&rdquo; said Michael Shifter, the president of the Inter-American Dialogue in Washington. &ldquo;Fidel is one of the few people in which Ch&aacute;vez has utter faith and trust. He is prepared to entrust his health to Fidel, even if he could get better treatment elsewhere.&rdquo;        

Mr. Ch&aacute;vez certainly had other options. Last week President Dilma Rousseff of Brazil proposed in a telephone call to Mr. Ch&aacute;vez that he come to Brazil to receive treatment from the same medical team that treated her cancerous lymphoma, a high-level Brazilian official said Friday. As an alternative, she offered to send two of Brazil&rsquo;s best doctors to Caracas to assist Mr. Ch&aacute;vez&rsquo;s doctors there, the official said.        

Instead, Mr. Ch&aacute;vez decided to head back to Cuba. After receiving permission from Venezuela&rsquo;s National Assembly on Saturday, he boarded a plane to Havana at 6:50 p.m.        

Beyond faith in Mr. Castro, analysts said, Mr. Ch&aacute;vez, 56, was also most likely betting that he could count on Cuban officials to disclose only limited information about his illness and prognosis.        

Details about Mr. Ch&aacute;vez&rsquo;s medical condition have been murky since he showed up in Cuba last month for medical treatment. Senior officials in his political movement initially denied news reports that he had received a diagnosis of some type of cancer. Officially, the Venezuelan government had said that Mr. Ch&aacute;vez underwent emergency surgery in Havana for a pelvic abscess, a collection of pus deep inside the abdomen.        

Mr. Ch&aacute;vez later confirmed that he had had that surgery, but that doctors in Cuba had also detected cancerous cells, requiring a second operation on June 20 to remove a tumor the size of a baseball. Neither he nor anyone else has revealed the exact location or type of cancer.        

On Saturday, Mr. Ch&aacute;vez said the cancer had not spread, saying doctors had found no malignant cells in other parts of his body.        

The Venezuelan leader&rsquo;s illness and choice to fight it abroad have continued to compound his political problems at home, where the country is coping with high inflation, electricity shortages and a rise in violent crime.        

Mr. Ch&aacute;vez appears to have given little thought to a possible successor, and key figures in his party and movement seem unsure of what to say or do without instructions from the president. On Saturday, he delegated various secondary functions to Vice President El&iacute;as Jaua and the minister of planning and finance, Jorge Giordani.        

Whether the splintered opposition can capitalize on his absence by next year&rsquo;s elections remains to be seen. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be back sooner than they want,&rdquo; Mr. Ch&aacute;vez said Saturday.        

The close relationship with Mr. Castro has been crucial to giving the Venezuelan leader his revolutionary credentials and sustaining Mr. Ch&aacute;vez&rsquo;s populist agenda.        

Yet within the region, Cuba has the most to lose from a transition to a post-Ch&aacute;vez Venezuela, all the more reason why Cuba&rsquo;s leadership has a strong incentive to do whatever it can to resolve Mr. Ch&aacute;vez&rsquo;s medical situation, analysts said. Cuba&rsquo;s economy is heavily dependent on Venezuela&rsquo;s highly subsidized oil, which accounts for about two-thirds of Cuba&rsquo;s oil needs.        

Without that subsidy, the Cuban economy &ldquo;would not necessarily crash, but it would endure a devastating blow that it can hardly afford right now,&rdquo; Mr. Shifter said.
