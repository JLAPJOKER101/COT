A roadside bomb planted at the entrance to the southern port city of Sidon struck a United Nations convoy Tuesday, wounding five French soldiers, one of them seriously, the United Nations said. The attack comes just two months after another bomb near the same spot wounded six Italian peacekeepers. Prime Minister Najib Mikati ordered an investigation, though there was no immediate claim of responsibility.
