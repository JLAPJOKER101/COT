Pope Benedict XVI on Wednesday appointed the president and the governing board of a new financial watchdog aimed at overseeing the Vatican&rsquo;s finances and helping it comply with international policies against money laundering and the financing of terrorists. Benedict announced the new agency in December and on Wednesday appointed Cardinal Attilio Nicora, left, already the Holy See&rsquo;s de-facto finance minister, as its president. The four board members, all laymen, have backgrounds in accounting, law and finance.
