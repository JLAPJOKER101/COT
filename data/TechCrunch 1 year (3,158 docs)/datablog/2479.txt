Founded by CEO Chad Pankewitz, the company currently has a major client, Burson-Marsteller in China.Chinaâ€™s social media and Internet landscape has many unique characteristics that render the existing tools and platforms inoperable in China, says Pankewitz. There are 485 million people online and 900 million mobile users in China. We believe it is important to give businesses, inside and outside of China, the tools they need monitor, track, and gain meaningful insights into the millions of online conversations taking place in real-time. Understanding these conversations and social media trends is critical for making the right business decisions in China.The tool allows for real-time social media tracking as well as improved control over reputation management and influencer monitoring.

The software comes in two version  one for large agencies with Chinee clients. AlphaOutlook offers a white-label service so companies can offer the service as part of a service package.The second version is a subscription-based software as a service and allows customers to pay a monthly, quarterly, or yearly fee. You can sign up for a private beta here.This slideshow requires JavaScript.
