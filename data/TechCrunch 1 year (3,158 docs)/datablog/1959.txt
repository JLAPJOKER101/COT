Yesterday Droid-Life obtained a leaked internal document from Verizon that had a surprisingly annoying little tidbit within: Beginning 1/15/12, there is a $2 convenience fee for making a credit or debit card bill payment online or via call-in channels. Sometimes leaks are faked or forged, and I hoped against hope that this particular leak was a load of malarkey. But alas, Phonescoop has apparently received confirmation via email that Verizon will in fact impose this convenience fee starting January 15. Happy New Year, everyone. Conveniently enough, Verizon has laid out a few ways for you to avoid such a convenience. I realize Im harping on it, but the only joke bigger than this $2 fee is the fact that theyre calling it a convenience fee. Convenient to whom (other than Verizon, of course)? Youd think that processing online payments would actually be more convenient for Big Red than processing paper payments, and it doesnt necessarily encourage environmental friendliness, either. Either way, you wont have to pay the extra $2 if you choose to send in an electronic check through My Verizon Online, My Verizon Mobile or via telephone. Using Autopay will also rid you of this charge if youre using credit/debit/ATM cards or electronic checks. If you pay through customer home-banking services, pay in-store at the kiosk, or use a Verizon Wireless gift card or device rebate card to pay a bill in-store, online or by telephone, the fee will also be waived. Obviously, you can always pay with a standard paper check mailed directly to Verizon Wireless along with your bill (the same way people paid their bills in the olden days), but some of us live in the 21st century. Verizon customers who dont check the blogs or news as much as you fine people will be notified at the time of payment (both online and by phone) that an extra $2 is being charged.
