The Vatican, reeling from unprecedented criticism over its handling of sexual abuse cases in Ireland, took the unusual step on Wednesday of publishing its internal files about a priest accused of molesting youngsters in Ireland and the United States. The files, published on the Web site of Vatican Radio, are part of the documentation the Holy See plans to turn over to American lawyers representing a man who says he was abused by the Rev. Andrew Ronan, who died in 1992. The Vatican said that the documentation culled from the Vatican&rsquo;s internal personnel files proved that it had learned of the accusations against Father Ronan only in 1966, after the abuse against the plaintiff occurred.
