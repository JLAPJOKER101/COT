About 300 peasants armed with machetes and automatic rifles tried to take over a ranch in northern Honduras in a land dispute that left 11 people dead, the police said Monday. A police spokesman said two peasants and four guards were killed at the Paso del Agu&aacute;n ranch on Sunday. On Monday, the police found the bodies of five more peasants, three men and two women, in a trash dump near the ranch. The Agu&aacute;n Valley in Col&oacute;n State has been plagued by land conflicts. At least 35 peasants and ranch guards have been killed there over the last two years. Security Secretary &Oacute;scar &Aacute;lvarez said 1,000 soldiers and police officers would be sent to the area.
