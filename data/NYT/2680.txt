The Palestinian Authority said Tuesday that it was delaying local elections scheduled for July until late October in order to organize the voting in Gaza, which is controlled by Hamas. Last month, Hamas and its rival, Fatah, which dominates the Palestinian Authority, announced a surprise unity agreement. Palestinians have not held an election in five years because of a bitter split between the groups. The October poll will indicate how each party is faring as it prepares for legislative and presidential elections within a year, as called for in the unity accord.
