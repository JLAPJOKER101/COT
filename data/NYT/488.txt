ROME &mdash; New details of alleged sexual escapades at Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi&rsquo;s private villas were leaked on Thursday after prosecutors presented documents to Parliament in an effort to gain permission to search the prime minister&rsquo;s properties.        

The parliamentary committee that voted on the matter denied the request by a vote of 11 to 8, saying it had to be taken up by judicial authorities. The majority of the committee members are Berlusconi allies.        

Mr. Berlusconi has consistently denied any wrongdoing.        

Details of the documents leaked this week were widely reported in the Italian press and included allusions to raunchy parties in which women attended in exchange for gifts. The reports, which could not be independently confirmed, were based in part on transcripts of conversations about the parties that the prosecutors obtained through wiretaps and interrogations.        

Prosecutors are investigating whether Mr. Berlusconi compensated Moroccan-born Karima el-Mahroug, nicknamed  Ruby Rubacuori, or  Ruby Heart-Stealer, for sex at his villa outside Milan when she was a minor. Ms. Mahroug has said she never had sex with Mr. Berlusconi.        

Mr. Berlusconi, 74, is also accused of helping to get her released from police custody when she was detained for theft last spring.        

The prosecutors have also said that  &ldquo;a significant number&rdquo; of young women  prostituted themselves to the prime minister, obtaining cash or rent-free housing in exchange for sex.        

The fresh details of alleged improprieties prompted Pier Luigi Bersani, leader of the Democratic Party, the largest group in the opposition, to call on Mr. Berlusconi to step down. In a note published on the party Web site, Mr. Bersani said the prime minister&rsquo;s resignation would &ldquo;free the country from an embarrassment that is no longer sustainable.&rdquo;
