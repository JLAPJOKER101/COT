DAKAR, Senegal (Reuters) &mdash; Senegal on Sunday suspended a decision to send Hiss&egrave;ne Habr&eacute;, the former Chad leader, back home to face trial for crimes committed while he was in power in the 1980s.        

Madicke Niang, Senegal&rsquo;s foreign affairs minister, said the decision had been made after the intervention of Navanethem Pillay, the United Nations high commissioner for human rights, who earlier on Sunday called on Senegal not to extradite Mr. Habr&eacute; unless he was guaranteed a fair trial and not face torture or execution.        

Mr. Habr&eacute;, 69, who was ousted in a coup in December 1990, has lived in Senegal since then. Chad has accused him of thousands of killings and other atrocities.
