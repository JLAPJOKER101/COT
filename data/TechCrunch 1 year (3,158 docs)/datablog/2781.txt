What can I say, I just dig Kutiman. I first covered the work of the Israeli-born artist back in 2009 with the release of Thru You, a seven-track music project created by splicing and dicing YouTube clips.It was back in March when I covered the release of a new, jazzier sounding tune of his called, My Favorite Color.Well, hes back with another one of those block rockin beats This time Kutiman unleashes his splice-and-dice style upon democracy. Enjoy:
