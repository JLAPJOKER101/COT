BEIJING &mdash; China announced on Wednesday that it would join its southeastern neighbors to conduct police patrols on the Mekong River, after the killings last month of 11 Chinese crewmen in an area plagued by drug smuggling.        

The episode provoked anger in China and embarrassed Thailand, which is prosecuting nine of its soldiers &mdash; members of an antidrug task force &mdash; in connection with the attack.        

The Web site of People&rsquo;s Daily, the Communist Party&rsquo;s official newspaper, reported that China would send five patrol ships to protect cargo ships from China, Laos, Myanmar and Thailand. A Foreign Ministry spokesman said leaders of all four countries agreed on Oct. 31 to jointly police the river, a shipping route that stretches nearly 3,000 miles.        

The exact nature of the initiative remained unclear. China Daily, the state&rsquo;s main English-language daily newspaper, reported that nearly 1,000 armed police officers would be deployed. Other Chinese news reports suggested that China would send 600 armed officers. But Xinhua, China&rsquo;s official government news agency, said that the country was only considering armed patrols, and that it would consult Laos, Myanmar and Thailand.        

Carlyle A. Thayer, a University of South Wales professor and Southeast Asia specialist, said that while leaders of those three countries understand China&rsquo;s desire to protect its ships, they would likely object if China sent an outsize force. China seems to be taking the lead, he said, but the others likely &ldquo;will want an equal partnership.&rdquo;        

&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think the countries in that region are going to want to see that heavy of a Chinese hand,&rdquo; he said.
