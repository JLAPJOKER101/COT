China&rsquo;s defense ministry said the nation&rsquo;s much-publicized first aircraft carrier, a Soviet-era hulk being refitted in a north China shipyard, will be used purely for research and training and not for deployment in military situations, Xinhua reported.        

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Speaking at a ministry news briefing for Chinese journalists on Wednesday, the spokesman, Geng Yansheng, said the ship would be used in part to train pilots in the delicate art of taking off and landing carrier-based jets from the deck of a ship rolling in ocean waters.
