About 8,000 workers at an electronics factory in the southern city of Nanjing have been on strike this week against what they call low wages from their South Korean employers, according to a statement on Tuesday by China Labor Watch, an advocacy group based in the United States. Caijing, a Chinese newsmagazine, reported some details of the strike on Wednesday. The workers are angry that their year-end bonus equals only a month&rsquo;s pay, while Korean workers are getting a year-end bonus equal to six months&rsquo; salary, according to the statement from the labor group. The strike began Monday. On Wednesday afternoon, according to Reuters, there were indications that workers might accept an offer by employers of two months&rsquo; salary as a bonus. The factory makes electronics for a unit of LG Group, a South Korean company.
