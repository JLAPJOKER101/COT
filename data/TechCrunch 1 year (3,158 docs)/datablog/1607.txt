Mark one up for Samsung. After months of legal and PR battles, the South Korean company is finally able to sell and market their iPad clone in Germany. Just dont call it an iPad clone anymore. The Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1N (pictured left) is slightly different from the iPad  but thats all that matters. Samsung released the Galaxy Tab 10.1N late last year. This version features a silver boarder around the screens black bezel. The speakers were also relocated in a stereo configuration and now flank the screen. The original GalTab 10.1 was a blatant iPad ripoff. This version at least looks slightly different. The Dusseldorf Regional Court said there are clear differences between the 10.1N and Apples iPad, essentially clearing it for retail sale. This ruling shoots down Apples request for a preliminary injunction. No doubt Apples all-star legal team will fight the decision, but theyre quickly losing support. The reworked 10.1N at least appears to be significantly different from the iPad  at least to the point that any 10.1 slate can look different from another one.
