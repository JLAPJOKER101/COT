A bomb blast tore through a beer garden on Friday at a Nigerian Army barracks where revelers had gathered to celebrate New Year&rsquo;s Eve, witnesses said, and state-run television reported that 30 people were killed, though the police immediately disputed that, saying that at least 4 had died. A local police spokesman said the explosion occurred about 7:30 p.m. in Abuja, the capital. Separately, the police said they had arrested a man suspected of being a leader of a radical Muslim sect responsible for dozens of killings in northern Nigeria, along with 91 suspected sect members. The Borno State police chief said Friday that they had arrested the man, Bunu Wasili, a 65-year-old businessman believed to be a founding member and financier of a sect known as Boko Haram, on Thursday.
