Four Palestinians were charged on Wednesday with the murder of an American tourist, Kristine Luken, who was killed in a forest outside Jerusalem in December. Ms. Luken, an evangelical Christian in her mid-40s, had been hiking with a friend who was also stabbed, but survived. Micky Rosenfeld, a police spokesman, said that the attackers came from the West Bank, and that they were suspected of at least one other murder. One of the group said that the attacks began as revenge for the killing of a senior Hamas official in a Dubai hotel room a year ago, Mr. Rosenfeld said.
