SARCELLES, France &mdash; In some ways, it is just a drop of costly olive oil in a turbid lake, but for 15 women from this poor Paris suburb, it is a chance for a stable and nourishing, if difficult, career.        

Inspired by former President Clinton&rsquo;s admonition for every businessman to do what he can to help others, Alain Ducasse, chef and patron extraordinaire, is putting the 15 women through a professional cooking course, with rigorous work experience at one of his restaurants and a guaranteed job for those who complete their certificates.        

All are from Sarcelles, all were either born outside of France or are first generation immigrants. Most have a passionate interest in cooking but little knowledge of French cuisine, accustomed instead to North African traditions and families eating from one large dish. A young woman from Mali screamed, her friends said, when she first saw a live lobster.        

Lynda Kabchou, 34, who was born in Algeria and has three children, feels grateful and anything but patronized. She is away from home for nearly 12 hours a day, with travel into central Paris, where she is working at Ducasse&rsquo;s flagship restaurant, in the luxurious Plaza Ath&eacute;n&eacute;e.        

&ldquo;To have a place at the Plaza, it&rsquo;s not given to everybody,&rdquo; she said, taking a break from the endless job of cleaning and cutting up chickens. She is proud to be one of the 80 people who work &ldquo;in white,&rdquo; their names embroidered on their uniforms, in this spotless kitchen, which has three Michelin stars. The professional kitchen is a rigorous, male-dominated world of hierarchy that everyone describes as &ldquo;brutal.&rdquo; But Ms. Kabchou welcomes the rigor, and the opportunity.        

&ldquo;They are learning to cut, season, cook, reduce, taste,&rdquo; Mr. Ducasse said. &ldquo;Mastery is expertise, the repetition of every move.&rdquo; He has assigned each of the women a &ldquo;tutor&rdquo; in the restaurant, to help them succeed.        

Ms. Kabchou is learning. &ldquo;If I do a recipe for the first time, I follow the written technique to the letter,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;After three times I can do it without it.&rdquo; Originally assigned to another Ducasse restaurant, Aux Lyonnais, she was happy to prepare and cook pork, but as a Muslim, refused to taste it. So she was granted a transfer to the Plaza.        

Aziza Berkouki, 26, is French-born, of Moroccan parents. Married at 19, and with two daughters, 6 and 3, she says she is lucky in that her husband, who works in a paint factory, is willing to do the cleaning at home. She pursued a certificate as a secretary, she said, but ran out of money, and then could not find a job. &ldquo;With no diploma and no baccalaureate, it was hard,&rdquo; she said.        

But a social worker told her about this opportunity. &ldquo;I was born in the kitchen,&rdquo; she said, describing how she learned to cook from her grandmother and mother. French cuisine interested her, and she watched cooking shows on television.        

&ldquo;It was a secret vocation,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Now to me it&rsquo;s a new life that&rsquo;s opening.&rdquo; She, too, would like her own restaurant someday, a fusion of French and Moroccan cultures. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m entirely French, but I&rsquo;m entirely Moroccan,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I want these two nationalities in my cooking.&rdquo;        

But the experience is testing, she said. At her Ducasse restaurant, Benoit, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s hard, it&rsquo;s a world of men,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The chef is rather tough.&rdquo; Some of the others see her as &ldquo;the Arab,&rdquo; she said, laughing. &ldquo;For now I&rsquo;ve mostly done soups. So they call me the queen of soup.&rdquo;        

The women will soon spend three days a week at the restaurants and two days a week at school, a reverse of the pattern that began with the project in September. They go to a modern trade school for apprentices in Villiers-le-Bel, next door to Sarcelles. The school, which opened in 2003 with financing from the city, the regional government and the European Union, concentrates on cooking, automobile repair and personal services, like hairdressing. It is designed for people 16 to 25 years old, to teach them a trade in partnership with businesses, who agree to help train them.        

Run by the Chambre de M&eacute;tiers et de l&rsquo;Artisanat, the school has about 700 students who spend two years to get their certificate and another year, if they can, to get a professional baccalaureate. Given that this is France, there are different certificates for bakers and pastry chefs, cooks and wait staff.        

The 15 Ducasse women, however, are an exception that could be a good example, said Sophie Marchand of the Chambre. As adults, they are taking a concentrated course of only nine months to get the same degree, but Laurent Coplot, a manager at the school, says that &ldquo;we don&rsquo;t leave out anything important.&rdquo;        

In the school&rsquo;s kitchen, Chef Patrick Margery puts the students and these women through their paces, sometimes barking orders, moving around the workspaces, indicating when the potatoes are not fully cooked or what to do with the filling for the crepes. Having been a master chef himself, he wants to pass on his knowledge. &ldquo;We have to be hard here, but we also have to be passionate,&rdquo; he said.        

The school also runs a small restaurant, open to the public, which dares to eat the products of the school kitchen, but for only $18 for a three-course meal. The other day it was a beef roast or a curried chicken, with flan for dessert topped with a big tuile cookie.        

Mr. Ducasse, born on a farm, himself rose up through the kitchens of France, beginning as a 16-year-old apprentice with abiding memories of his grandmother&rsquo;s cooking. He has an empire, and he wanted to give a little something back &mdash; a chance for some women who would not normally have it. He worked with a legislator from the region, J&eacute;r&ocirc;me Chartier, who asked him if there was something he could do to help.        

&ldquo;The main problem in life is to have the physical and intellectual capacity to be independent,&rdquo; Mr. Ducasse said. &ldquo;If so, there are no problems, only solutions.&rdquo;        

In a way, this project is like cooking, he said. &ldquo;Cuisine, it is first a personal satisfaction, it&rsquo;s very egotistical. First I am happy with what I have made, and then I want to share it. First you prepare for yourself, and then you give it to someone.&rdquo;
