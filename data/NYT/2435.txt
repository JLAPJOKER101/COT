An explosion ripped through a Yemeni military vehicle in the south of the country on Wednesday, killing five soldiers. Four civilians died after the blast when panicked soldiers fired their weapons. The town where the attack occurred, Zinjibar, is in a province known as a stronghold for a branch of Al Qaeda, but Yemeni officials said it was unclear who had set off the explosion.
