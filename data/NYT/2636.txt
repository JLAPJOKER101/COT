BEIJING (AP) &mdash; The sister of the detained Chinese artist Ai Weiwei said Monday that he had been allowed his first family visit in 43 days.        

The Beijing police took Mr. Ai&rsquo;s wife, Lu Qing, to an undisclosed location Sunday night where she was able to see and talk briefly with her husband.        

The sister, Gao Ge, said Ms. Lu reported that Mr. Ai seemed healthy and was being given access to medication that he needs. Ms. Gao said the police had still not told the family where Mr. Ai was being held. She said the family was relieved to know he was well, but hoped the government could clarify what was going on with his case.
