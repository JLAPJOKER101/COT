Gather round, dear friends, for a tale of courage and heroism is about to unfold. Rising from a years worth of ashes, the Windows-powered Nokia Lumia 800 stands to rewrite Nokias potentially devastating fate, which is why Nokia dedicated eight whole minutes of video to its design process. As I said, this isnt a bite-sized clip so feel free to settle in and learn a little something about how Microsoft and Nokia came together. The video is actually quite interesting once you get past the numerous references to courage and bravery. (Its a phone; not a bomb that needs to be diffused.) Still, Nokia has been in quite the crunch lately and has put nearly all their eggs in the Microsoft basket, so I guess the Lumia 800 is a bit of a life-or-death situation over in Finland after all. In any case, I found the bits about the phones polycarbonate unibody interesting, as well as the collaboration between the Redmond folks and the Nokia designers. Windows Phone 7.5 Mango is one OS Im truly excited about, and Id say the only thing missing from this video is a heartfelt proposition to developers. So Ill ask instead: Dear developers, please build some cool applications for Windows Phone 7 if you can. Thanks, Jordan.
