The Chinese foreign minister, Yang Jiechi, called on Monday for the resumption of international talks over North Korea&rsquo;s nuclear program. The negotiations, involving the two Koreas, the United States, Russia, Japan and China, stalled in 2009. In August, Kim Jong-il, left, the North Korean leader, said that he was willing to return to the talks as long as there were no conditions and that he would consider a moratorium on the nuclear program if talks resumed. The United States and South Korea have said they will resume the talks only if North Korea meets promises related to the nuclear program. The top nuclear envoys from North Korea and South Korea are scheduled to meet in Beijing on Wednesday.
