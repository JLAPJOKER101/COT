Christchurch, New Zealand&rsquo;s second-largest city, faces up to 20 years of rebuilding as a result of an earthquake in February that destroyed one-third of its central business district, according to a business official involved in the project. &ldquo;There will not be a finite day on which this is finished,&rdquo; said Jonathan Ling, chief executive of Fletcher Building Ltd. &ldquo;There will be new buildings going up&rdquo; in the central business district, Mr. Ling said, &ldquo;on empty blocks probably for 10, 15 or 20 years.&rdquo; Fletcher Building was appointed by the government as project manager for the reconstruction of homes damaged in Christchurch after a magnitude 7 temblor on Sept. 4. It is also directing some repairs in the business district after another quake, on Feb. 22, killed more than 170 people and destroyed much of the city.
