Floods in southern and southeastern Brazil have forced about 31,000 people to leave their homes, authorities said Monday. Civil defense officials said more than 14,000 people have been driven from their homes in Santa Catarina State, about 10,000 in Parana State, and 6,000 in Espirito Santo. Parana officials said three people had died in landslides set off by the heavy rains that have inundated the region since Thursday.
