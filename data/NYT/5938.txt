Britain will deploy ground-to-air missiles if they are judged &ldquo;operationally necessary&rdquo; to protect the 2012 summer Olympic Games in London, Defense Minister Philip Hammond told Parliament on Monday. With less than nine months to go before the Games, Mr. Hammond offered reassurances about safety in the wake of British newspaper articles saying concerns about the adequacy of security arrangements had been raised by the United States. &ldquo;All necessary measures to secure the security and safety of the London Olympic Games will be taken, including &mdash; if the advice of the military is that it is required &mdash; appropriate ground-to-air defenses,&rdquo; Mr. Hammond told the House of Commons. Police spokesmen have said that 12,000 officers will be deployed to protect the Olympic sites, as well as at least 10,000 private security guards, and that British military units will be on standby if needed.
