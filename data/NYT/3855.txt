President Alpha Cond&eacute; escaped two attacks on his residence that killed at least three people and left his home riddled with bullets on Tuesday, in assaults that authorities linked to former senior officers in the army. The attacks renewed international concerns about the stability of the impoverished West African country. A senior police official said that a former army chief dismissed by Mr. Cond&eacute;, above, days after he came to power last December had been arrested. &ldquo;Our enemies will not be able to stop Guinea&rsquo;s progress,&rdquo; Mr. Cond&eacute; said.
