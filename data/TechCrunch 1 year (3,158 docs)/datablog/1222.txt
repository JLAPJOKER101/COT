One more sign of the mobile money space continuing to grow up: some significant consolidation underway. Today, the UK-based mobile banking specialists Monitise announced that it is buying Clairmail, a U.S.-based competitor, for $173 million, as part of its global expansion.The combined group says it will serve 13 million customers world-wide processing some $10 billion of payments weekly, and will give Monitise a much bigger and direct presence in the North American market: one-third of the top 50 U.S. financial institutions are now clients of the group.Monitise and Clairmail both focus on an infrastructure play around mobile banking and mobile payments. Their main business is in providing the backend to let banks and other financial institutions offer mobile banking, payment and shopping services to its customers.Alastair Lukies, Monitise Group CEO, tells me that Monitise is not actively looking for further acquisitions but that, if opportunities come along, we will take them seriously.As mobile banking and mobile money services continue to mature (and see many new entrants enter the game, from PayPal to Square and so many more), its inevitable to see consolidation in the space to further the global reach of such services.But Lukies says he believes that there is much more room for smaller companies and innovation at the edges of mobile payments systems  that is, those that touch consumers  than there is among the infrastructure players like Monitise, which are likely to continue scaling up.He says that for now Monitise is not interested in acquiring those smaller companies: We are not into the piloting and the bleeding edge stuff, he says.The link-up between Clairmail and Monitise will not only give the two companies a bigger geographical reach, but will also give customers of the companies access to providing banking services on a much wider international scale.This deal is transformational for our customers, our team, our shareholders and our company. It is a compelling combination and great news for all those wanting to offer bank-grade mobile money services to billions of consumers, not only in the US but worldwide, commented Alastair Lukies, Monitise Group CEO, in a statement.That is also furthered by Monitises existing strategic relationships with payments giants Visa Inc. and FIS. (Visa, of course, has been making other big investments into how it can best leverage the development of mobile money services, from partnerships with operators to acquisitions, such as its purchase of Fundamo last year.)Pete Daffern, the CEO of Clairmail, will continue on as the head of Clairmail within the combined  company and will also join the group executive board.Full statement below:Clairmail to be Acquired by MonitiseAcquisition Unites Mobile Money Leaders to Power a New Generation of Global Financial Institutions and Consumers Through a Comprehensive Set of Mobile Banking, Payment and Commerce SolutionsSAN RAFAEL, CA(Marketwire  Mar 26, 2012)  Clairmail, Inc., a leading North American mobile banking and payments provider, today announced that it has entered into a definitive acquisition agreement with Monitise plc (LSE: MONI.L), the technology and services company delivering mobile money networks worldwide.
