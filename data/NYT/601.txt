A 54-year-old man has admitted sexually abusing more than 100 mentally disabled children and adults in care homes in Switzerland and Germany during almost three decades, in what the Swiss police described Tuesday as an unprecedented case. The abuse took place in nine different institutions where the unidentified man had worked as a therapist since 1982, the police in the state of Bern said. The authorities have identified 122 of the victims, with the youngest being 1 year old at the time of the crime. The man was arrested in April 2010, but the police released details of the case Tuesday to prevent the investigation from being impeded by media interest. The case came to light in March, after two male residents of a care home in the northeastern state of Aargau informed their parents of sexual contact with the therapist.
