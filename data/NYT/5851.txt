Russia&rsquo;s first effort at an interplanetary mission in more than two decades went awry on Wednesday when an unmanned spacecraft failed to take the proper course toward Mars after its launch, space officials said. The Russian space agency chief, Vladimir Popovkin, said an engine failed to fire on the probe, known as Phobos-Soil, after it reached Earth&rsquo;s orbit, the Interfax news agency reported, putting in doubt its mission to bring back a soil sample from the Martian moon Phobos. Mr. Popovkin said officials were in contact with the probe, which remained in Earth&rsquo;s orbit, and had three days to set it on course before the batteries ran out.
