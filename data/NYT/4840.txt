A Dutch court ordered the government on Wednesday to compensate the widows of seven villagers who were summarily executed and a man wounded in a notorious 1947 massacre during Indonesia&rsquo;s battle for independence from colonial rule. The landmark ruling was the first time the Dutch government has been held responsible by a court for the massacre. The Hague Civil Court said it was &ldquo;unreasonable&rdquo; for the government to argue that the widows were not entitled to compensation because the statute of limitations had expired. Estimates of the death toll in the village of Rawagedeh in western Java vary from 150 to more than 430.
