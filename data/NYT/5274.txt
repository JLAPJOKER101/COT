Russian investigators said Friday that they would press charges against a man they accuse of arranging the killing of the journalist Anna Politkovskaya, left, five years after her death. Investigators said they believed that Lom-Ali Gaitukayev, a native of Chechnya who is serving a term for another killing, was contracted in July 2006 to organize the killing of Ms. Politkovskaya, a prominent critic of the Kremlin under President Vladimir V. Putin. Colleagues and activists said they doubted the inquiry would reveal who was behind the killing. &ldquo;As long as Putin is in power, I think the person who ordered the killing will not be found,&rdquo; Lev Ponomaryov, a rights activist, said at a commemoration.
