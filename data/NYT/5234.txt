Uncertainty hanging over Liberia&rsquo;s imminent presidential election ended Wednesday when the Supreme Court threw out a challenge to the incumbent, Africa&rsquo;s first woman to be elected as head of state, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, left, along with her principal rivals. The civil war here, lasting more than a decade, had scattered the country&rsquo;s political class, and a small opposition party said that Mrs. Johnson Sirleaf violated a constitutional clause requiring candidates be residents for 10 years before the election, which is next Tuesday. But the court said the Constitution&rsquo;s authors could not have foreseen the extended conflict into which the country plunged. &ldquo;We considered the suit frivolous from the beginning,&rdquo; a spokesman for the president&rsquo;s party said; the opposition politician who filed it, Simeon Freeman, criticized the decision as &ldquo;political.&rdquo;
