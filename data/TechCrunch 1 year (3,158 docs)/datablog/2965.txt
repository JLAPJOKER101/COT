The iOS App Store is quite the volatile place. Even if you manage to fight your app up to the top of the charts, keeping it up there is an entirely new challenge. Youve got to know exactly whats working with your users â€” and more importantly, youve got to be able to mix things up quickly when you find things that arent.Alas, mixing things up quickly on the App Store is inherently a bit difficult. Even if you can crank out everything required for your app update in a week or two, you can never be too sure if Apples review process will take a day, a week, or a month.This morning, PlayHaven is launching a new platform that allows iOS developers to launch and test content campaigns within their apps without requiring another trip through the approval arena.The idea is pretty simple, but its a clever one: PlayHavens platform lets developers design and fire off what they call Dynamic Overlays, which are essentially quickly customizable HTML5 pop-ups that engage the user and can fire off underlying code.Now, what the hell does that mean? Heres some examples of what you can do: These are the most obvious ideas, but theres plenty of room for creativity here. These Dynamic Overlays can be triggered by just about anything: scheduled dates, version number, accessing a specific part of the application, etc., which should make them pretty flexible.PlayHaven also makes it pretty simple to figure out whats working and whats not, with a full analytics dashboard sitting on the backend. So you launched a campaign in your crazy space shooter advertising your new zombie flower-planting game, but no one is clicking? Tweak the graphic to make the zombie a bit bloodier and your flowers a bit brighter, push the new overlay, and measure the changes in click-throughs and conversion rate on-the-fly.PlayHaven has quickly found some pretty serious traction for the platform, already naming heavy-hitters like Halfbrick (Fruit Ninja), DistinctDev (The Moron Test), and Glu (with their bajillions of games) as committed partners. You can find more information on PlayHavens new platform here.
