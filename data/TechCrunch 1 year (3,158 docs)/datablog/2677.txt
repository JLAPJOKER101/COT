Oh well. Wheres that iPhone 4S pre-order link? Samsung and Google decided that it is just not the right time to announce a new product and postponed the scheduled Nexus Galaxy/Prime and Ice Cream Sandwich debut. The two companies were supposed use the CTIA stage next Tuesday to unveil the next-gen superphone and Googles latest Android incarnation. But thats not going to happen per a joint statement released this morning. Samsung and Google decide to postpone the new product announcement at CTIA Fall. We agree that it is just not the right time to announce a new product. New date and venue will be shortly announced.This takes the event off the books for next Tuesday, October 11th. The mobile world was expecting the big unveiling of the Nexus Galaxy (or Prime, if previous rumors are believed). Details leaked yesterday concerning the so-called superphone that places a 1.2GHz CPU, backed by 1GB of RAM at the core. The phone is said to include an NFC chip, 32GB of storage and a 5MP camera with a 1080p recording mode. Of course none of this was confirmed. Next Tuesday was going to be a big day for mobile nerds.Eric Schmidt previously stated that Google would launch Ice Cream Sandwich by November. Hopefully Google stays true to its word and the Nexus Galaxy/Prime event will be back on the books sometime this month.But fear not. A leaked demo video hit the interwebs today that might satisfy your Ice Cream Sandwich craving. Its hard to tell if this is the real release or just a clever Android 2.x launcher, but were leaning more towards the former. The video doesnt have any glaring goofs or obvious flaws. The OS shown is silky smooth, the animations are right, and theres certainly a Honeycomb feel throughout the whole thing. If that video is indeed Ice Cream Sandwich, current Android owners might want to hold off jumping on the 4S bandwagon. A beast is nearly upon us.
