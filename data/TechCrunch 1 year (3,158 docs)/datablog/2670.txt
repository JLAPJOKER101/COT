There is a certain strange person that used to mention me on Google+ and whenever Id click on the mention (I couldnt resist I MEAN ITS RIGHT THERE) Id get slightly depressed. And Id think, Why Google? Why cant I do the Google+ equivalent of blocking this strange person?Apparently I wasnt alone on this, as Google has now given Google+ users the ability to control who has the power to up the count on the red blinky notification thingy in the right hand corner of your Plus bar. Hoorah!Users can now adjust when notifications go off for individual sharing, mentions, hangout invites, play invites, messages sent and when users select the notify about this post function. But before you go get all drunk with this nascent power, youll still get notified if someone comments on your posts or adds you to a new circle, inexplicably.Baby steps  Of course I dont have the feature yet, because Google is rolling it out slowly. Fear my TechCrunch power.
