An anarchist group that has claimed responsibility for sending letter bombs to foreign embassies in November claimed responsibility on Wednesday for an explosion that damaged a court building in Athens last week. The group, the Conspiracy of the Cells of Fire, said in a statement that the blast was in protest of the coming trial of 13 people suspected of belonging to the group. In the statement, published by the online Indymedia news network, it threatened the judges and vowed that &ldquo;for every year in prison given to our brothers, we will plant a kilogram of explosives in your front yards, in your cars, in your offices.&rdquo;
