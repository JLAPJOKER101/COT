The prosecutor in the assassination case of the former Lebanese prime minister Rafik Hariri said he filed an expanded indictment on Friday. The indictment remains secret and the names of the suspects under investigation have not been released. The prosecutor, Daniel Bellemare, said the amendment &ldquo;expands the scope&rdquo; of the initial indictment he filed in January. A spokesman for the special tribunal in Leidschendam, the Netherlands, said it could take months for judges to review thousands of supporting documents.
