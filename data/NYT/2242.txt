ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) &mdash; Volleys of gunshots erupted again in Abidjan on Monday as an old feud between rival warlords came to a head, threatening the fragile peace in Ivory Coast.        

It remains uncertain whether President Alassane Ouattara can control any of the six warlords who helped install him in power by employing their militias to help oust the former strongman Laurent Gbagbo, who lost a presidential election in November but refused to relinquish power.        

The latest fighting was between the forces of the two men who fomented a rebellion in 2002 that divided the country between the rebel-held north and government-run south: Ibrahim Coulibaly and Defense Minister Guillaume Soro, who is also the prime minister.        

Mr. Coulibaly&rsquo;s aides on Monday accused Mr. Soro&rsquo;s camp of attacking their forces and plotting to assassinate their leader in an ambush on the way to what they said was supposed to be a meeting with Mr. Ouattara.        

In 2004, the two men&rsquo;s militias waged bloody battles for leadership in the rebels&rsquo; stronghold, the city of Bouake. Mr. Soro won and Mr. Coulibaly was forced into exile. Now there are fears that their feud could destabilize Abidjan, the country&rsquo;s commercial capital, where one-third of the nation&rsquo;s 15 million people live, just as Mr. Ouattara has appealed for banks to reopen and everyone to return to work on Tuesday.        

On Friday, Mr. Ouattara declared the war over with Mr. Gbagbo&rsquo;s arrest on April 11. He ordered Mr. Soro&rsquo;s combatants, who are to form the corps of a new army with former Gbagbo troops, to return to their barracks in the center and west of the country. And he ordered Mr. Coulibaly to disarm or expect to have his weapons taken by force.
