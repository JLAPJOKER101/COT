A court in Ecuador has convicted six police officers of security crimes for taking part in a protest in which President Rafael Correa was briefly detained. The officers include the former chief of security for the nation&rsquo;s Congress and five members of the detachment there. Hundreds of police officers protested on Sept. 30 over a legislative proposal to cut their promotion bonuses. Police officers roughed up Mr. Correa and trapped him for hours in a police hospital. He was rescued by army commandos firing assault rifles and concussion grenades. About a dozen people died.
