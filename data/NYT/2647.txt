A Belarussian court convicted a journalist and critic of the nation&rsquo;s authoritarian president on Monday of helping to organize a large antigovernment protest in December. The journalist, Irina Khalip, received a two-year suspended sentence. Her husband, Andrei Sannikov, a former presidential candidate, was sentenced to five years in prison on Saturday for a similar offense, and the authorities had previously threatened to take custody of their young son.
