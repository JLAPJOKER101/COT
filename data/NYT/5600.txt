Coordinated bombings in the insurgency-plagued south killed at least three people and wounded dozens on Tuesday, and the military blamed Muslim insurgents. Bombs were detonated at 12 spots in the town of Yala and occurred on the anniversary of the suppression of an antigovernment protest in neighboring Narathiwat Province in 2004. More than 4,700 people have been killed in Thailand&rsquo;s southernmost provinces in the Islamic insurgency there.
