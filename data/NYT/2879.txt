The police rescued 116 children who had been forced into labor in Ghana&rsquo;s Volta Lake area, a police superintendent said Friday. The official, Patience Quaye, said that officers had found parents in fishing communities who had sold children as young as 4 for as little as $100. Child labor is a widespread problem in the West African nation, the superintendent said, adding that the police rescued 284 children in a similar operation last year.
