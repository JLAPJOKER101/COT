UNITED NATIONS &mdash; The United Nations moved on two fronts on Friday to bolster the nascent Libyan government, with the Security Council lifting some economic sanctions and the General Assembly accepting the credentials of the transitional government to represent Libya in the world body.        

The move to ease sanctions was approved unanimously, 15-0, in the Council, but some African and Latin American nations tried unsuccessfully to block acceptance of the interim government&rsquo;s credentials.        

The Council voted to unfreeze the assets of the Libyan National Oil Corporation and the state-run Zueitina Oil Company. It also allowed four banks, including the Central Bank of Libya, to buy humanitarian aid, fuel and electricity, and to take needed measures to bolster the economy. Some controls remain in place to thwart any attempt by Qaddafi family members to exploit Libya&rsquo;s wealth.        

The Council also established the United Nations Support Mission in Libya, a political mission whose main tasks include helping to write a constitution, organizing elections, and offering advice on restoring security and national reconciliation.        

In the General Assembly, old friends of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, including Venezuela and South Africa, led the attempt to block the transitional government from taking Libya&rsquo;s seat. They argued that only a sitting government could be admitted. But the members voted 114-17, with 15 abstaining, to recognize the authority.
