President Dmitri A. Medvedev has signed into law the first steps intended to restrict abortion in Russia since the collapse of Communism. The changes require abortion providers to devote 10 percent of any advertising to describing the dangers of abortion to a woman&rsquo;s health, and they make it illegal to describe abortion as a safe medical procedure. The changes, which will take effect in 30 days, were signed by Mr. Medvedev on Monday and announced Thursday on the Kremlin&rsquo;s Web site. Parliament is expected to consider tighter restrictions on abortion in a separate bill this fall.
