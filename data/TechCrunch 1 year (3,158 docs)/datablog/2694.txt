NuCaptcha, a startup that develops a human-friendly video captcha technology, is announcing a dedicated captcha produt for mobile devices, available for all mobile platforms including Android and IOS platforms. For background, captchas are security questions you find on Web sites that require you to decipher and type words or numbers and detects whether the user is a human or a spambot. Most Captchas you see are transcription, text-based Captchas. Of course, captchas can often be confusing, and not user-friendly. NuCaptcha is trying to solve this pain point by offering site owners a more user-friendly alternative, called a video captcha.  NuCaptcha has spent the last few years optimizing its security so that 3 un-distorted letters can be used on most sites. Sites that need more security can add up to 8 letters if threats are detected through The NuCaptcha Behavior Analysis System.The mobile version of NuCaptcha includes the same simplicity as the web version. But the new optimized mobile Captchas provides a consistent user experience on multiple devices. For example, when a user clicks on a mobile touch screen to solve a Captcha, it will fit perfectly into the space left by the keyboard so that the Captcha can be quickly and easily completed. NuCaptcha does not require Flash or JavaScript; and the company expects to release the HTML5 mobile version of its Captcha technology in early Q4 2011.Currently serving millions of Captchas per month, NuCaptcha offers a Free, Pro and Enterprise offering, and users can determine the size, choice of videos, security level, and even optional branding, advertising and revenue generation through NuCaptchaâ€™s Advertising Programs. NuCaptcha faces competition from ReCaptcha, which Google acquired  in 2009.
