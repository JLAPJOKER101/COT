BAGHDAD &mdash; Seven Iraqis traveling in a pickup truck were killed in an airstrike on Sunday in Iraqi Kurdistan, the semiautonomous region in northern Iraq, according to local officials. Two of the victims were children, they added.        

The officials said the attack was carried out by Turkey, which has been conducting airstrikes on Kurdish rebels since Thursday.        

The officials said the pickup was struck by a missile in the remote Kewan Mountains near the village of Kur Taka. They said the victims were members of a family fleeing its village for the city of Erbil.        

A Turkish flag was burned as the bodies were buried Sunday, local news media reported.        

The Turkish government unleashed the airstrikes to punish guerrillas with the Kurdistan Workers Party, or P.K.K., which it holds responsible for a quadruple bombing ambush on a military convoy by the rebels on Wednesday.        

Fighters associated with the group, which has been fighting for Kurdish autonomy in southeast Turkey for two decades, have been under attack recently from the Iranian side of its border as well. A spokesman said Sunday that he expected the attacks to increase from both the Turks and Iranians after the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.        

The spokesman, Ahmed Diniz, said that two days ago Iranian soldiers entered Iraqi territory in an effort to attack Kurdish fighters. He said the Iranians have yet to leave Iraq.
