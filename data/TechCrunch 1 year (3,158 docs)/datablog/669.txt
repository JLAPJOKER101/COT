As you do.If youre thinking of picking this up youd best have about $10,000 to $15,000 handy  although bidding could get fierce. Quoth MacWorld:This is the earliest know documentation produced by Steve Jobs and predates the founding of Apple computer by almost two years.  No other documents from Steve Jobs time at Atari are known to exist.  Sothebys sold another Steve Jobs document in December, 2011  for $1.6 million.
