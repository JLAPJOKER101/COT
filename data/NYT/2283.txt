Thai and Cambodian troops fought with short-range rockets and guns near the 900-year-old Preah Vihear temple on Tuesday, opening a second front in a five-day confrontation that has killed 13 people in Southeast Asia&rsquo;s bloodiest border dispute in years. A Thai official said that one Thai soldier was wounded. There were no reports of Cambodian casualties. Sovereignty over Preah Vihear and two other ancient, stone-walled Hindu temples about 90 miles west of it &mdash; Ta Moan and Ta Krabey &mdash; and the jungle of the Dangrek Mountains surrounding them has been in dispute since the French withdrew from Cambodia in the 1950s. Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva of Thailand said defense ministers from both sides might hold cease-fire talks on Wednesday.
