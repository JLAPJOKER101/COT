MEXICO CITY &mdash; President Ren&eacute; Pr&eacute;val of Haiti said Monday that he would stay in office for three more months, extending his term until after a March 20 runoff to choose his successor.        

Mr. Pr&eacute;val&rsquo;s term had been scheduled to end Monday, but an emergency law passed after last&rsquo;s year&rsquo;s devastating earthquake allowed him to stay longer because his 2006 inauguration was delayed. His chief of staff, Fritz Longchamp, told The Associated Press that Mr. Pr&eacute;val would leave on May 14, which would most likely be enough time for the next president to take over.        

Mr. Pr&eacute;val&rsquo;s decision was largely expected by Haitians and the international community, in part because it is unclear who would take his place. The Haitian Constitution states that the highest-ranking member of the country&rsquo;s top court would be second in line, but the court&rsquo;s presidency is currently vacant.        

Jos&eacute; Miguel Insulza, the secretary general of the Organization of American States, which has been working closely with Haitian election officials, said that forming a transitional government for such a short period of time could lead to more difficulties for a country already struggling to create a peaceful transition of power.        

&ldquo;I would feel more comfortable with the president staying,&rdquo; he said.        

Mirlande Manigat, a constitutional scholar and one of the contenders to become Haiti&rsquo;s next president, has said that she supports leaving Mr. Pr&eacute;val in power until after the runoff.        

Nonetheless, news of his decision to stay led to several small protests in downtown Port-au-Prince, the capital, on Monday morning. Photographs and video posted on Twitter showed tires being burned, dumpsters being overturned and United Nations troops guarding the capital&rsquo;s destroyed presidential palace.
