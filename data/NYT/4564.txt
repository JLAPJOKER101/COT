One of Taiwan&rsquo;s best-regarded hospitals said H.I.V.-infected organs were mistakenly transplanted into five patients after a staff member misheard the donor&rsquo;s test results over the telephone. The five are now being treated with anti-AIDS drugs, an official at the National Taiwan University Hospital in Taipei said Monday. The hospital said on its Web site that the mistake occurred because a staff member mistakenly believed he heard the English word &ldquo;nonreactive&rdquo; concerning the donor&rsquo;s standard H.I.V. test. The donor&rsquo;s heart, liver, lungs and two kidneys were transplanted into separate patients on the same day.
