Five opposition parties have jointly denounced the Sunni-ruled island as a police state and demanded a transition to a constitutional monarchy. The opposition groups, including the main Shiite party Wefaq and the secular Waad party, vowed to keep up a pro-democracy campaign with peaceful rallies and marches, despite a Saudi-backed government crackdown that crushed similar protests in March. Their Manama Document, issued Wednesday, said the ruling Khalifa family should &ldquo;govern without powers&rdquo; in a constitutional monarchy. Pro-government media described the document as a power grab by the Shiite majority.
