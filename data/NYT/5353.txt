A Polish security agency said Wednesday that 19 people had been arrested across the country on suspicion of producing and possessing explosives. The Internal Security Agency said the arrests were part of a wider investigation into the illegal production and sale of explosives that was opened after Norway asked Poland to investigate people with links to Anders Behring Breivik. Mr. Breivik has admitted to killing 77 people in July, first by bombing the government headquarters in Oslo and then by attacking a summer youth camp. Poland was asked to provide information on a man who was mentioned by Mr. Breivik as a possible source of substances that could be used in the production of explosives. The agency said in a statement that large quantities of explosives were seized on Tuesday and Wednesday during a search of about 100 homes and dozens of cars and garages.
