The embattled Italian prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi, went on television on Wednesday for the second time in recent days to defend himself from an investigation focusing on his encounters with a Moroccan teenager. He said that the Milan prosecutors investigating him used methods worthy of Mafia criminals and  that he would not respond to a summons issued by the prosecutors because he did not wish to give credence to an illegitimate investigation.  Mr. Berlusconi is alleged to have paid for sex with a young woman when she was a minor. The woman has denied having sexual relations with the prime minister.
