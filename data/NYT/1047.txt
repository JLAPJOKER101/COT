China dropped the death penalty on Friday for more than a dozen nonviolent crimes and banned capital punishment for people over the age of 75. The official Xinhua news agency said it was the first time the government had reduced the number of crimes subject to the death penalty since 1979. The changes were not expected to significantly reduce the number of executions in China, which executes more people than any other country. In the past, people convicted of these crimes &mdash; which include forging invoices to avoid taxes and smuggling cultural relics out of the country &mdash; rarely received the death penalty.
