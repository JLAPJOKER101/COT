The Palestinian president called on the international community on Friday to draft a new formula for peace talks with Israel and set aside the current process, which he said was &ldquo;managing the conflict but not solving it.&rdquo; American mediators have turned to indirect talks to seek a way out of the impasse. But with those  efforts in tatters and no clear way out, the president, Mahmoud Abbas, said in remarks in the West Bank that the international community should step in to devise a new vision for peace between Israel and the Palestinians. He did he not elaborate on what a new formula might entail.
