Israel dismissed its deputy ambassador to Washington over allegations that he leaked top-secret information to an Israeli journalist, a Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said Wednesday. The diplomat, Dan Arbel, a senior civil servant, faces a disciplinary procedure in Jerusalem. The alleged leak occurred more than two years ago, before he arrived in Washington. The case involves information related to Iran that apparently angered the United States. In December 2009, a top ministry official, Alon Bar, was suspended on suspicion of having given the information to a reporter for the newspaper Haaretz. Mr. Bar was exonerated and is now the ambassador to Spain. The investigation continued and led to Mr. Arbel, the ministry said.
