ROME &mdash; The backdrop may be the Termini train station, but the chatter these days evokes a Damien Hirst opening. The object of the attention is a 17-foot-tall bronze sculpture of Pope John Paul II unveiled on May 18, his birthday.        

The verdict, at least as registered by the Italian news media and several online polls, is a merciless thumbs down.        

The starkly spare sculpture by a Rome-based artist, Oliviero Rainaldi, depicts the pope condensed into a massive mantle as if to envelop the faithful. It has been alternately described as a sentry box, a bell and a papal vespasiano, as Romans call a urinal. (Vespasian was the first-century emperor who levied a tax on urine, which was used for tanning leather.)        

The crescendo of outrage grew so rapidly that Rome&rsquo;s traffic cops had to be deployed to keep a 24-hour watch to ward off potential vandalism until video cameras could be installed on surrounding lampposts.        

Repeated calls for the sculpture&rsquo;s removal led Mayor Gianni Alemanno to enlist a commission of experts (no names have been released), to determine its fate: whether to leave it, ask for changes or put it in a less prominent location.        

For others, this is much ado about nothing.        

&ldquo;You know, in Italy everyone thinks they&rsquo;re the coach of the national soccer team. Now, we have a nation of 60 million art critics,&rdquo; said Umberto Broccoli, who heads the city&rsquo;s Cultural Heritage Department, which approved the artist&rsquo;s sketches. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to minimize the debate, but it&rsquo;s time to tone it down.&rdquo;        

The Fondazione Silvana Paolini Angelucci, a charitable organization, donated the sculpture to the city to celebrate the beatification of John Paul II this month. Mr. Rainaldi, the artist, was chosen because he had worked on several ecclesiastical commissions, and the foundation was confident that he could interpret the pope&rsquo;s spirit. It was designed for the square in front of Termini, which was dedicated to the pope in 2006, a year after his death.        

&ldquo;We were happy to accept a statue that cost the city zilch,&rdquo; Mr. Broccoli said.        

In just a few months, sketches were drawn up and approved by city and Culture Ministry officials and by the Vatican&rsquo;s fine arts commission.        

But the authorities had not counted on the ruthless Roman vox pop.        

&ldquo;It&rsquo;s horrible, the colors are ugly and he doesn&rsquo;t have a neck,&rdquo; said Eleonora Traditi, 22, a communications student. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s scary.&rdquo;        

&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know what it is,&rdquo; said the Rev. Daniel Moll of Marquette, Mich. The pope&rsquo;s life &ldquo;was about clarity of faith, but this statue leaves me confused,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It seems to be the opposite of what his life was.&rdquo;        

Francesco Maria Giro, the deputy culture minister, may have captured the general reaction when he described the statue as a &ldquo;manifesto of ugliness&rdquo; and urged the city to remove it.        

Even L&rsquo;Osservatore Romano, the Vatican daily, published a harsh critique. The face &ldquo;bears only a remote resemblance to the pope,&rdquo; wrote a critic, Sandro Barbagallo. &ldquo;Over all, the result does not live up to the intent.&rdquo;        

While artistic debates rage often in this city of trimillennial treasures &mdash; Richard Meier&rsquo;s Ara Pacis Museum, which opened in 2006, is still an object of lively controversy &mdash; the most common criticism is that the statue fails at the basic level of presenting a likeness of the pope, who forged an intimate relationship with Rome, where, during the 26 years of his papacy, he also held the title bishop of Rome.        

&ldquo;We Romans wanted a statue that represented our pope, a man we loved very much,&rdquo; said Gian Battista Vannozzi, an architect. &ldquo;As a work of art it may be beautiful, but as a representation of our pope, well, we Romans want something else. This doesn&rsquo;t work.&rdquo;        

For now, Mr. Rainaldi, the sculptor, is taking the criticism in stride. &ldquo;Usually, I get more compliments,&rdquo; he said in a telephone interview. &ldquo;Otherwise, I wouldn&rsquo;t have survived in this business for 40 years; they would have stopped me earlier.&rdquo; (Mr. Rainaldi has works in private collections and churches in Europe and the United States.)        

The sculpture, he added, was never meant to be representational, though he was inspired by a photo of John Paul II enveloping a child in his cloak during a public audience many years ago.

&ldquo;That gesture seemed to me to be representative of the entire spirit of his pontificate: the meeting of cultures, the idea of dialogue, of offering a hand,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And if that hand is wrapped in a cloak, it takes on ulterior symbolism, like shelter and protection, an embrace towards and of people.&rdquo;        

The welcoming message of the work, the idea of embracing travelers and pilgrims to Rome, was appropriate for a place where people come and go, said Ambassador Umberto Vattani. Mr. Vattani, the president of the Italian Institute for Foreign Trade, is an expert on contemporary art who established the modern art collection at the Italian Foreign Ministry a few years ago.        

But &ldquo;the way modern artists go about creating works is often not the way that the faithful imagine them,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Difficulty of understanding is not uncommon.&rdquo;        

The most renowned pontifical statuary &mdash; by the likes of Michelangelo, Bernini or Canova &mdash; is mostly inside churches. Two other public statues dedicated to John Paul II, one in the atrium of the Vatican Museums and the other in front of the Gemelli Hospital, are modern in concept, but less stylized in form.        

Francesco Buranelli, secretary of the Vatican fine arts commission, said the debate should not be reduced to a question of liking or not liking the statue. Contemporary art, regardless of when it was created, &ldquo;shouldn&rsquo;t be judged by subjective parameters,&rdquo; he said. By that measure, he said, an infinite number of works now considered to be masterpieces, like Michelangelo&rsquo;s &ldquo;Last Judgment&rdquo; or Caravaggio&rsquo;s &ldquo;Virgin of the Pilgrims,&rdquo; would have been whitewashed or destroyed.        

He suggested, however, that Mr. Rainaldi&rsquo;s piece could be a bit more engaging. &ldquo;For many, this work is hard to read,&rdquo; he said.        

The commission of experts will meet for the first time on Thursday, but Mr. Broccoli cautioned that decisions should not be taken in haste.        

&ldquo;I told the mayor that he should give it some time,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;A work of art has to be looked at, meditated upon. Only then can it be appreciated.&rdquo;
