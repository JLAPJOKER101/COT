A lawyer said Tuesday that he had mailed a criminal complaint to the Paris prosecutor&rsquo;s office accusing Dominique Strauss-Kahn of attempting to rape the novelist Tristane Banon in 2003. After Mr. Strauss-Kahn, the former chief of the International Monetary Fund, was arrested in New York in May on a similar charge, Ms. Banon hired the lawyer, David Koubbi. When prosecutors receive the complaint, an investigative judge would be appointed to look into the allegations. Mr. Strauss-Kahn&rsquo;s lawyers have said that Ms. Banon&rsquo;s accusations are &ldquo;imaginary.&rdquo;
