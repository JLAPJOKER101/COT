A North Korean agent was sentenced Friday to 10 years in prison for plotting to assassinate a high-profile defector. The North Korean, Ri Dong-sam, admitted that he was ordered to kill a former senior member of the North Korean  Workers&rsquo; Party, a Seoul Central District Court spokesman said. Mr. Ri went to South Korea in August by posing as a defector, and his plot was discovered while he was being interrogated. His target, Hwang Jang-yop, was the chief architect of North Korea&rsquo;s philosophy of self-reliance and one of the country&rsquo;s most powerful officials when he fled in 1997. Mr. Hwang died of heart failure last year.
