Security and anti-spam firm McAfee today reported that it saw a massive uptick in mobile malware last quarter. Mobile malware has exploded, the company said (PDF), with a significant increase on Android devices. In addition, McAfee also found a slight increase in malware targeting the Mac, but the report notes that this trend was not extreme. Despite the increase in mobile and Mac malware, as well as password-stealing Trojans, the good news in todays report is that global spam level dropped quite a bit during the last quarter, though we are still talking about a trillion messages per month.This quarters increase in mobile malware is partly due to the fact that McAfee improved its ability to find these threats, but it still represents a massive increase. The company collected about 8,000 mobile malware samples last month. These threats, as usual, mostly target Android. While Google and other major store have made great strides in keeping malware out of their stores, third-party stores and forums remain a problem. Among the areas of mobile malware that saw major increases in threats was mobile backdoor malware and the always popular premium-rate SMS-sending malware.The report also noted that the company found one of the first destructive Android Trojans this quarter.
