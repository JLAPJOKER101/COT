An Italian soldier who had been reported killed by insurgents in western Afghanistan this week was instead killed by an Afghan soldier, the NATO-led coalition said Thursday. NATO had initially reported that two soldiers, identified by Italian officials as Italians, were killed in an insurgent attack in the Bala Murghab district of Badghis Province on Tuesday. On Thursday, the coalition amended the report, saying the two soldiers were cleaning their weapons when an Afghan soldier approached them with an M-16 rifle and asked to use their equipment to clean his weapon. The Italians noticed that the Afghan soldier&rsquo;s rifle was loaded and asked him to unload it. The Afghan soldier reacted by shooting the Italians and then fleeing the outpost, NATO said. One soldier was killed and the other wounded.
