Celebratory gunfire wounded two people in Baghdad on Friday after Iraq defeated China, 1-0, in World Cup qualifying play. Before the Asia Cup earlier this year, the Iraqi government banned celebratory gunshots, which are in part a legacy of looting of military arsenals in 2003 that widely dispersed guns to the population. Iraqis seem to pay no heed and shoot anyway, probably making victory shooting, and injuries from falling bullets, a part of soccer culture in Iraq for some time.
