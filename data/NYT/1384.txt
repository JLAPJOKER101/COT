At least 30 people who took part in rare antigovernment protests last weekend have been sentenced, Human Rights Watch reported Monday. Participants received sentences of five to eight days in prison after trials lasting from 5 to 40 minutes. Defense lawyers said that they were not informed of the trials&rsquo; time or place, and that judges denied access to the news media and family members.
