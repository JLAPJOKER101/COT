Russian security forces killed at least seven people believed to be militants in Chechnya on Wednesday, a spokesman for the region&rsquo;s Moscow-backed leader said. The Kremlin is struggling to contain a growing Islamist insurgency in the North Caucasus, and the violence has now spread from Chechnya to other mainly Muslim regions. Russia wants to turn the North Caucasus, where the 2014 Winter Olympics are to be held, into a tourist destination and cut unemployment, which exceeds 50 percent in parts of the region, according to official statistics.
