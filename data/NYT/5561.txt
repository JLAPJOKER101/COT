A video of a Tibetan monk&rsquo;s attempt to kill himself last month by self-immolation to protest Chinese policies has been released. The video was given anonymously to The Associated Press and released Sunday. It shows a monk, Lobsang Konchok, lying in a street in the town of Aba, in Sichuan Province, with his robes and shoes partly burned off. Security officers and a police car are visible in the background. The monk set himself on fire on Sept. 26 but lived. Nine Tibetans have set themselves on fire this year in Sichuan, and at least five have died.
