LIVERPOOL, England &mdash; When he became prime minister last year, David Cameron announced that the days of big government were over. In its place he proposed to build something called the Big Society, a new model in which public-private partnerships, charities and community groups would take over as the state pulled back.        

Critics derided the notion as too nebulous and touchy-feely; in one poll, 63 percent of respondents said they did not understand what Mr. Cameron was talking about. But it still sounded promising to Liverpool, which volunteered to be one of four so-called vanguard members of the new program.        

That is, until a city already braced for cuts learned exactly how much money Mr. Cameron&rsquo;s government planned to remove from its budget &mdash; $147 million this year, far more than it had anticipated. Nor, Liverpool claimed, had the government fulfilled promises to help reduce bureaucracy and provide tax relief to the city&rsquo;s charities.        

Just as hastily as it had signed itself up to the Big Society, Liverpool signed itself out.        

&ldquo;It seemed hypocritical to be standing up and saying, &lsquo;Here we are, a flagship for the Big Society,&rsquo; at the same time as we were having to make cuts whose impact is going to have a devastating effect on our voluntary sector,&rdquo; Paul Brant, deputy leader of the Liverpool City Council, said in an interview. Among the difficulties, he said, is that the government insists that the bulk of four years of cuts take place right away.        

Liverpool&rsquo;s concerns are being echoed up and down the country, as local governments face the consequences of the central government&rsquo;s four-year, $131 billion cost-cutting program and wonder how it squares with the goals of Mr. Cameron&rsquo;s Big Society. Many localities depend on the central government for the bulk of their revenues &mdash; in Liverpool&rsquo;s case, 80 percent of the total &mdash; and the central government is cutting those payments by an average of 28 percent.        

Struggling to keep their essential services afloat, places like Liverpool are cutting services like libraries, reading programs, community swimming pools, after-school activities for troubled teenagers, homeless shelters, care for the disabled, help for the elderly, children&rsquo;s centers and the like. Many such programs are run as charities but are financed in part through public money.        

Experts estimate that the voluntary sector stands to lose $5 billion to $8 billion in the next four years.        

&ldquo;Does one hand know what the other hand is doing?&rdquo; Dame Elisabeth Hoodless, who is retiring after 36 years as the executive director of the umbrella group Community Service Volunteers, told The Times of London last month.        

The speed and thoroughness of the changes are consistent with Mr. Cameron&rsquo;s tenure so far. In less than a year on the job, he has set in motion a reorganization of the National Health Service; drastically overhauled the welfare system; and begun aggressively promoting the notion that many government services &mdash; from schools to hospitals &mdash; should be opened to the free market.        

But the Big Society is his big mission.        

&ldquo;This is my absolute passion,&rdquo; he said recently. &ldquo;I think it is a different way of governing, a different way of going about trying to change our country for the better, and it&rsquo;s going to get every bit of my passion and attention over the five years of this government.&rdquo;        

The argument has become angry, and deeply political. Critics accuse the coalition government of using the deficit as an excuse to carry out an ideological paring-back of the state.        

&ldquo;They&rsquo;re using the current crisis to do what they&rsquo;d want to do anyway,&rdquo; said Mr. Brant, the Liverpool councilman.        

The cuts, he said, are disproportionately affecting the poorer parts of the country &mdash; the ones that depend more on central government money &mdash; which, as it happens, mostly tend to be run by the opposition Labour Party.        

Mr. Cameron says that the budget cuts he has outlined are based on necessity, not philosophy. And he says the localities are making cuts intended to embarrass the government. Instead of canceling charity programs, they should reduce their own &ldquo;salaries, bureaucracies and allowances,&rdquo; as he said recently.        

&ldquo;What we are seeing is politically motivated moves by Labour councils,&rdquo; he told Parliament on Feb. 9, speaking of Liverpool.        

But Mr. Brant said the council had already delivered efficiency savings of more than $113 million in three years. These included cutting half the council&rsquo;s senior management posts. This year&rsquo;s budget reduces aid to the voluntary sector by nearly 50 percent, to $31 million from $60 million.        

&ldquo;The reason we&rsquo;re doing this is because we don&rsquo;t have any money,&rdquo; Mr. Brant said.

To allay some of the anxiety and promote his project, Mr. Cameron&rsquo;s government has set up a $161 million transition fund to help midsize charities; opened a $322 million Big Society Bank, to which groups can apply for loans at market rates; and pledged to train 5,000 community organizers.        

But none of this is much consolation to Ken Norman, a trustee of Chipping Norton Lido Limited, far from Liverpool, who grew so indignant that he posted on YouTube a video of himself complaining about the Big Society.        

Eight years or so ago, Mr. Norman&rsquo;s group took over the local outdoor swimming pool, called a lido, when the government said it was too expensive to run. Open five months a year, the pool costs $137,000 annually. Volunteers do most of the work.        

Just about the only money the lido gets from the government, Mr. Norman said in an interview, is a $2,400 annual tax break. This year, that benefit was withdrawn. It is not much in the scheme of things, of course, until you consider how many more donations the lido will have to solicit and how many more cupcakes it will have to sell to raise money in a bad economy, when more charities are competing for donors.        

&ldquo;I feel complete frustration at the fact that on the one hand we&rsquo;re being held up as an example of the Big Society in action, and that at the other end of the scale, the local authority withdraws the only smattering of support they give us,&rdquo; Mr. Norman said.        

In Liverpool, the cuts are beginning to trickle down. The $147 million being cut this year comes from a budget of $2.25 billion, about $650 million of which Liverpool controls (the rest is earmarked for specific programs).        

Alan Lewis, chief executive of Liverpool Charity and Voluntary Services, said his group was losing $1.74 million from its $2.6 million budget.        

He said that a time of austerity was the worst time for the state to start shedding its responsibilities. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re on a lifeboat and someone has fallen into the water,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And you tell them: &lsquo;You can swim along, and while you&rsquo;re there, why not build your own lifeboat?&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;        

The group, a clearinghouse and voice for Liverpool&rsquo;s voluntary sector, provides business support to charities, helping them solicit money, deal with the government, lobby for financing, and the like. It has 59 employees; soon, it is likely to have 34 fewer. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re all on notice,&rdquo; Mr. Lewis said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m on notice.&rdquo;        

He added, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to be a long time before we&rsquo;re as big a society as we are now.&rdquo;
