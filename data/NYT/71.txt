President Hugo Ch&aacute;vez said Tuesday that he would veto a controversial law that would have increased government control of universities. The announcement came  amid criticism that Mr. Ch&aacute;vez had used the departing legislature in its final weeks to concentrate his powers and gain new abilities to crack down on dissent. The law on universities was one in a series of measures &mdash; including one granting the president decree power for 18 months &mdash; approved in December by the National Assembly. Mr. Ch&aacute;vez explained during a televised cabinet meeting on Tuesday that he decided against the law on universities, passed by his congressional allies, because it had some weaknesses. Thousands of students had protested in the streets, saying the law would inject socialist ideology into universities that have been a bastion of opposition to the president. Mr. Ch&aacute;vez also announced that he no longer saw a need to raise the value-added tax, an idea he had proposed as a way to help finance  reconstruction efforts after severe floods.
