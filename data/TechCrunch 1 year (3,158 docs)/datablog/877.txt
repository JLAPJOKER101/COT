The makers of traffic app Waze are the latest company wanting to go beyond the phone and integrate more deeply with car hardware.Its a natural move — if you use Waze, you use it when youre driving. However, the whole dealmaking and integration process with automakers is long and complicated, so as a first step, Waze is looking at the aftermarket of devices that people can add to their cars. And its starting with Pioneers AppRadio.We wrote about AppRadio in more detail last year, but basically, when you connect your Android or iOS phone to the radio, a limited set of your apps will be accessible through the radio touchscreen. Now that set of AppRadio-enabled apps includes Waze, at least if youve got the Android version. (AppRadio integration is coming for Wazes iOS app too.)VP Community Geographer DiAnn Eisnor says Wazes AppRadio functionality is essentially the same as the smartphone apps — you can still get directions, look at real-time traffic data, and also let Waze collect data as you drive. However, the interface has been tweaked. For example, instead of simply freezing the keyboard when youre driving (Waze is big on hands-free interaction), the AppRadio display makes the keyboard disappear altogether.Eisnor also says that real connected car integration is coming soon, perhaps as early as this fall. From her perspective, the exciting thing is the ability to tap into all of the cars other sensors, so its not just tracking where you are and how fast youre going.This is milestone number one, she says.Heres the latest AppRadio ad, where you can see brief glimpses of the Waze integration. (If you dont want to watch the whole thing, or you miss the Waze cameos, they start at 0:15 and 0:44.)
