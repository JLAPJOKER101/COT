Japan&rsquo;s nuclear safety officials reprimanded the operator of the tsunami-damaged Fukushima Daiichi power plant on Friday and demanded an investigation into how two workers were exposed to more than twice the government limit of radiation. The operator, Tepco, was ordered to submit a report within a week giving the cause and prevention measures. The two men, one in his 30s and the other in his 40s, were confirmed last week as having exceeded the limit and were removed from working at the plant. A third man, a senior control room operator in his 50s, is being tested further after early findings showed high radiation exposure.
