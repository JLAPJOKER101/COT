The Supreme Court has cleared six army generals accused of toppling President Manuel Zelaya and flying him to Costa Rica in 2009. The court voted 12-3 to reject abuse of authority charges against the now-retired generals, Romeo V&aacute;squez, Luis Prince, Venancio Cervantes, Miguel Garc&iacute;a, Juan Pablo Rodr&iacute;guez and Carlos Cu&eacute;llar. All six have been released from detention, the court said. Soldiers arrested Mr. Zelaya and flew him out of Honduras in 2009 after he defied a Supreme Court order to drop plans to hold a referendum on reforming the Constitution. Mr. Zelaya said the court decision was &ldquo;unjust&rdquo; but expected. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s bothersome that those behind the coup are being protected,&rdquo; he said.
