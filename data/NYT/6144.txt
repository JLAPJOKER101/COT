BOGOT&Aacute;, Colombia (Reuters) &mdash; Colombian rebels executed four members of the security forces who had been held hostage by the group for years, prompted by a failed mission to rescue the men, Colombian officials said.        

The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, which is known as the FARC and has a policy of killing hostages if troops approach their camps, shot three of the captives in the head and the fourth in the back, President Juan Manuel Santos said. The bodies were in chains, he said.        

&ldquo;These heroes of Colombia sacrificed their lives trying to bring peace to Colombia,&rdquo; he said.        

Colombia has been wracked by bloodshed from guerrillas and cocaine barons for decades, but the FARC, once a powerful force that controlled large parts of Colombia, has been severely weakened.        

Troops opened the rescue operation, in the southern province of Caqueta, 45 days ago after a tip that the FARC captives were being held in the area.
