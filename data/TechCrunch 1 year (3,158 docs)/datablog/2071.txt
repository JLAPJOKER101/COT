Dismissing rumors that he might be making a comeback at Microsoft, founder Bill Gates went down under to rule out the possibility of ever returning to the software behemoth full-time.Instead, he says, hell be working full-time at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation until the day he dies. Gates stepped down from his day-to-day role at Microsoft in June 2008.In an interview with Fairfax Media, Gates declared:Im part-time involved with Microsoft, including even being in touch this week to give some of my advice but thats not going to change â€“ the foundation requires all of my energy and we feel were having a great impact.He also says some things about Steve Jobs, but nothing that will surprise you: he was a brilliant person who was tough on Microsoft because its machines outsold his machines by a lot, and he was kinder to Gates in his last years. Sounds about right.Gates also pointed out that its summer in Sydney but that he wished it was a tiny bit warmer.(Image courtesy of World Economic Forum / Flickr)
