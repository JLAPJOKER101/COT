SEOUL, South Korea &mdash; Mudslides set off by torrential rain crushed mountainside houses and tourist dwellings in South Korea on Wednesday, killing at least 39 people, the police said.        

At a resort village in Chuncheon, 60 miles east of Seoul, university students running a volunteer summer camp for local children were asleep when a landslide engulfed their lodgings around midnight on Tuesday.        

Most of the 13 people found dead in the mud were university students, the police said. Police officers rescued 20 others from the muddy rubble that covered several homes and businesses.        

In southern Seoul, 16 people were found dead after a mudslide slammed into a hillside residential area and apartment buildings, the National Emergency Management Agency said.        

Three more people died in flooding in Kyonggi Province, south of Seoul. Ten people had been reported missing, but the agency said early Thursday that seven of them had been found dead.        

Rain has soaked much of the country for the past month. Since late Tuesday, up to 16 inches of rain, accompanied by thunder, has been reported in Seoul, the capital, and other parts of South Korea.        

On Wednesday morning, commuters found roads blocked by mudslides. Large stretches of Seoul&rsquo;s boulevards turned into brown pools, with the roofs of abandoned cars peeking out.        

&ldquo;I heard this terrible rumble,&rdquo; a 57-year-old survivor of the Chuncheon mudslide told the national Yonhap news agency. &ldquo;I woke up others, and we rushed out. In a split second, our motel was under the mud.&rdquo;
