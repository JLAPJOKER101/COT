A Chechen man has been arrested and charged in the killing of Yuri Budanov, a former Russian Army colonel who had been convicted of kidnapping and strangling a teenage Chechen girl, officials said Friday. Mr. Budanov was arrested in 2000, convicted of killing 18-year-old Heda Kungayeva while commanding a tank regiment in the second Chechen war and released on parole in 2008. He was shot to death in Moscow in June. The suspect, Magomed Suleimanov, has been charged with murder, a court spokeswoman said on Russia&rsquo;s NTV television. The Itar-Tass and Interfax news agencies said investigators believed that Mr. Suleimanov and another person agreed in April to kill Mr. Budanov.
