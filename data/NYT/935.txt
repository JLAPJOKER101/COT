The Vatican issued a rare statement on Friday warning people not to be fooled by agencies and Web sites selling tickets for the beatification of Pope John Paul II. It said no tickets were required for the ceremonies, in particular for the beatification Mass, which Pope Benedict XVI is expected to celebrate on May 1. Millions of visitors are expected in Rome for festivities surrounding the beatification of John Paul, which places him one step closer to sainthood. After the Mass on May 1, John Paul&rsquo;s tomb will be moved from beneath St. Peter&rsquo;s Basilica to its interior, where his remains will be on view.
