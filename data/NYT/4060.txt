GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) &mdash; A Caribbean Airlines jet from New York overshot a rainy runway, slid through a chain-link fence and broke apart just short of a ravine here on Saturday.        

Several dozen people were injured, but no one was killed among the 163 people on board, officials said.        

Passengers aboard the plane, a Boeing 737-800, said they had begun to applaud the pilot&rsquo;s landing in Guyana just after midnight when things went wrong.        

The applause suddenly &ldquo;turned to screams,&rdquo; said Geeta Ramsingh, 41, of Philadelphia. She said she hopped on the wing and then into the road outside the runway fence, apparently suffering only bruises.        

The plane, operating as Flight 523, apparently overshot the 7,400-foot runway at Cheddi Jagan International Airport and barely missed falling into a 200-foot ravine, said President Bharrat Jagdeo, who visited the crash site.        

About 100 people were injured, four seriously, said Devant Maharaj, the transportation minister in Trinidad, where Caribbean Airlines is based.        

The plane, which departed from John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York, stopped in Trinidad before landing in Guyana. The airline said it was carrying 157 passengers and six crew members.        

The cause of the crash was not immediately clear. Mr. Jagdeo said he had asked the United States National Transportation Safety Board to help investigate.
