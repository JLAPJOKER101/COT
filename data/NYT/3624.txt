The Shabab, the Islamist rebel group fighting the government of Somalia, announced that it would again allow aid organizations to operate in the areas the group controls. A rebel spokesman, Mohamoud Raghe, said in a news conference in Mogadishu that the aid groups were going to be allowed to work in order to help bring relief to areas hard-hit by a severe drought. The Shabab said its drought committee would work with the organizations. The rebels in the past accused many aid groups of acting as spies and of being anti-Muslim. Some analysts said the Shabab decided to allow the aid groups to work again because it wanted to stop the flow of hundreds of people to government-controlled areas in search of food.
