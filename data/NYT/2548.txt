Syria&rsquo;s attempt to join the United Nations&rsquo; main human rights body will very likely be thwarted by Kuwait, which is planning to seek the Asian seat traditionally reserved for an Arab country, Western diplomats said Tuesday.        

The Asian bloc was expected to present an uncontested slate on May 20 in the vote for new members for the 47-nation Human Rights Council. The Asian group nominated Syria, India, Indonesia and the Philippines.        

Asian nations have faced mounting criticism from other, mostly Western, countries, which contend that electing Syria to the council would be unacceptable given the violence, mounting death toll and mass arrests of protesters in Syria.        

&ldquo;I would be surprised if Syria would go on to face ridicule,&rdquo; said a Western diplomat, speaking on the condition of anonymity because the switch had not been officially announced.        

Bashar Jaafari, the Syrian ambassador, said his government had not told him that it was withdrawing from the race. He declined to comment on the criticism that Syria should be disqualified for the government&rsquo;s violent suppression of dissent. The Kuwait Mission to the United Nations did not return a telephone call seeking comment.        

The maneuvering to persuade another nation to seek a seat on a United Nations body after an uncontested, or clean, slate had been chosen is not unprecedented. Last November, the United States helped block Iran from gaining a seat on the board of the newly formed UN Women organization by persuading East Timor to run. Iran lost its bid.
