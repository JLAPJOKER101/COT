South Sudan, which is on the verge of independence, now has 10 helicopters and the beginning of an air force, the southern army spokesman said Friday. The spokesman, Philip Aguer,  did not say where the helicopters were from, but said they were transport helicopters that could be used as gunships. He said the south would not use them to antagonize the north, which has vastly superior air power.
