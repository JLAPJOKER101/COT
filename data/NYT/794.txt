Gunmen killed five people in central Nigeria late on Thursday when they stormed an agricultural college to steal cattle, the latest in a series of clashes between Christian and Muslim youths in the region. Youths from the Muslim Fulani ethnic group injured nine more people after breaking into a largely Christian farming college in the central Nigerian city of Jos, the police said. There have been almost daily clashes between Christian and Muslim mobs in villages around Jos, the capital of Plateau State, since a series of bombs were detonated during Christmas Eve celebrations, killing scores of people.
