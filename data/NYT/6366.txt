LONDON &mdash; The existence of the Bad Sex in Fiction award immediately raises the question, Why not a Good Sex in Fiction award?        

&ldquo;What on earth would you do that for?&rdquo; asked John Walsh, a columnist at The Independent, who was in the crowd on Tuesday night for this year&rsquo;s prize. &ldquo;Good sex is like good driving &mdash; it&rsquo;s the absence of things going wrong, and it is an extraordinarily boring thing to write about.&rdquo;        

Also, this is England, where sex is somehow funny anyway, and where people appreciate the agony of embarrassment much more than the thrill of achievement, at least when it happens to someone else.        

&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing the English love more than a good literary joke against someone who is well known,&rdquo; said Rachel Johnson, editor of The Lady magazine. She won the award in 2008, for a scene in her novel &ldquo;Shire Hell,&rdquo; in which the narrator lies back during lovemaking and thinks of slug extermination.        

&ldquo;What&rsquo;s so funny is that when I got the manuscript back from my American publisher, the editor had put a big tick in the margin and written the word &lsquo;Perfect,&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; Ms. Johnson said of her winning entry. &ldquo;This was the exact passage that in England won me the bad sex prize.&rdquo;        

It was in search of similar courageous efforts that a crowd of writers, publishers, seasoned partygoers and hangers-on, as well as the philosopher A. C. Grayling, gathered to hear a pair of volunteers try to remain calm while reading racy excerpts from the offending nominees, and to find out the winner. Even the location was a double entendre: the In and Out Club in central London.        

The host was the writer Alexander Waugh, the grandson of Evelyn Waugh and the son of Auberon Waugh, who was editor of the Literary Review in 1993 when the magazine first sponsored the prize. The idea was to &ldquo;draw attention to the crude, tasteless, often perfunctory use of redundant passages of sexual description in the modern novel, and to discourage it.&rdquo;        

&ldquo;We hoped no one would be writing this rubbish any more, but this prize has spectacularly backfired,&rdquo; said Mr. Waugh from the stage. Straying from the matter at hand, he spontaneously treated the audience to a limerick about a man from Kildare who has sex on the stairs.        

Judging from this year&rsquo;s 12 nominated books, including ones by Lee Child, David Guterson and Stephen King, bad sex is alive and vigorous, sometimes frighteningly so.        

The books&rsquo; sexually active protagonists are compared, among other things, to wakening beasts, lightning rods, outrageous sea creatures and &ldquo;the midnight train.&rdquo;        

They are panting fast and hard, and long and slow; they are sniffing, heaving, kneading, rubbing, pinching, flicking, biting, burrowing, darting, plunging, thrusting, bucking, shuddering, shivering, trembling, swelling and convulsing. And they are wondering, in the case of one character: &ldquo;Had the erection continued the whole time he was sleeping?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Where is my semen going?&rdquo;        

A woman in &ldquo;Dead Europe&rdquo; by Christos Tsiolkas has a &ldquo;cellar filled with a heady store of wines and spirits.&rdquo; And in &ldquo;1Q84&rdquo; by Haruki Murakami, a character observes not only that his lover has no pubic hair, but also that &ldquo;a freshly made ear and a freshly made vagina look very much alike.&rdquo;        

Most authors seem to take the accusation that their sex is bad with good humor. &ldquo;I hope to win it every year,&rdquo; said Iain Hollingshead, who won in 2006 with a novel containing the game-changing phrase &ldquo;bulging trousers.&rdquo;        

Mr. Tsiolkas, who is from Australia, was not so sanguine. Introducing the author&rsquo;s suspect passage (&ldquo;it was so full of disgusting bits it was very difficult to whittle down&rdquo;), Mr. Waugh reminded the crowd that Mr. Tsiolkas had responded last year to an earlier nomination, for his novel &ldquo;The Slap,&rdquo; by crossly accusing the award&rsquo;s judges of having had weird formative sexual experiences &ldquo;at Eton.&rdquo;        

&ldquo;Sounds completely reasonable,&rdquo; a man in the audience murmured.        

While there have been many distinguished American winners, including Tom Wolfe and John Updike, bad sex veterans reserve a special place in their hearts for Norman Mailer, who won posthumously in 2007 for a passage in which the word &ldquo;excrement&rdquo; is used so alarmingly that it threatens to put a reader off sex for good.        

&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all about embarrassment,&rdquo; said Michael Fishwick, publishing director of Bloomsbury. &ldquo;The British are embarrassed about sex, probably in a way that Americans aren&rsquo;t, and this makes everyone feel satisfyingly excruciating.&rdquo;        

From the stage, Mr. Waugh unearthed a crumpled piece of paper and handed it to Barbara Windsor, a soap opera actress who was presenting the prize.        

She announced the winner: &ldquo;David Guterous&rdquo; (actually, it was David Guterson; she had forgotten her glasses) for several pages of super-enthusiastic sex in his novel &ldquo;Ed King,&rdquo; a reimagining of Oedipus Rex. The judges praised Mr. Guterson&rsquo;s entry for its &ldquo;uncertain register, euphemism and ineffective irony,&rdquo; particularly in the part where &ldquo;she abused him with a bar of soap.&rdquo;        

Unfortunately, all the nominees were foreign, so none made it to the ceremony. But Mr. Fishwick, who said that he was not Mr. Guterson&rsquo;s actual editor, was on hand to pick up the award &mdash; a plaster foot, which is supposed to represent something to do with sex, though no one seems sure what &mdash; on behalf of Bloomsbury.        

Mr. Guterson sent a message: &ldquo;Oedipus practically invented bad sex, so I&rsquo;m not in the least bit surprised.&rdquo;
