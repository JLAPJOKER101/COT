Seven soldiers and 11 guerrillas died during two separate clashes on Monday, less than three weeks before elections to choose mayors and governors nationwide. Guerrillas of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia attacked an army convoy with explosives in the mountainous southwest of the country. In the second clash, the Colombian air force bombed a guerrilla camp in the north, Defense Minister Juan Carlos Pinz&oacute;n said.
