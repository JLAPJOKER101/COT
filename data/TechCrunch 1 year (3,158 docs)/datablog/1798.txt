SOPA protests are everywhere today. The Internet is collectively up in arms about the proposed legislation. Major sites are shut down, banners are everywhere, but thats online. Boxee is taking the fight to living rooms.Turn on a Boxee Box today and youll be greeted with three large black boxes that clearly state STOP SOPA. Theres no way to miss them. Featured videos generally occupy the prime real estate on the home screen. But not today. Today they direct viewers to a Vimeo video (embedded below) explaining the downfalls of Protect-IP.Boxee would be uniquely affected by the proposed legislation. The company is built around the idea of open video sharing. SOPA and PIPA could utterly disrupt this practice. Most of Boxees video sources are legitimate but many of the services apps would no doubt fall victim the purposed legislations murky wording. Boxees message is mostly preaching to the choir at this point. Chances are owners of Boxee Boxes are well aware of the horrors of SOPA. But it shows the sheer depth of todays movement. The message is everywhere: Stop SOPA.
