DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) &mdash; The authorities in Saudi Arabia on Monday released a woman who was detained for defying the kingdom&rsquo;s ban on women drivers, according to the human rights activist Waleed Aboul Khair.        

The woman, Manal al-Sharif, 32, had been detained since May 21 after posting an Internet video that showed her driving as part of a campaign for a mass protest in June against the restriction.        

Ms. Sharif had been ordered to remain in custody until at least early June. The authorities did not say why she was released.
