A Senegalese opposition activist is being charged with murder after a political clash this month that left one person dead and three others wounded. The activist, Barthelemy Dias, who is the youth leader of the West African country&rsquo;s Socialist Party, has said that he acted in self-defense after opponents attacked his office on Dec. 22. The charges against Mr. Dias stirred unrest late Wednesday in Dakar, the nation&rsquo;s capital. Senegal&rsquo;s 85-year-old president, Abdoulaye Wade, is planning to run for a third five-year term on Feb. 26. Those plans, as well as frequent power cuts and the rising cost of living, have set off violent protests this year.
