In an interview just weeks before his trial on charges he paid for sex with a minor and tried to hide it, Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, 74, left, argued that prosecutors&rsquo; claims that 33 women had prostituted themselves at his parties were untrue. &ldquo;Even though I am a little mischievous,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;33 girls in two months seems like too much even for a 30-year-old.&rdquo; The interview, with La Repubblica, was a newsworthy event itself given that it is a leftist newspaper that has pushed for his resignation and that he has avoided talking with all but a few loyalist publications.
