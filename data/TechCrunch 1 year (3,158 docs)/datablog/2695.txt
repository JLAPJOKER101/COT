The Europas, the European Tech Startup Awards supported by TechCrunch Europe, will be on November 17 in London. 450 of Europes top startups, VCs and entrepreneurs will celebrate the European startup scene with 20 awards after taking hundreds of entries, sifting with an advisory board, putting the finalists to a public vote by the industry and merging the results. You can still buy tickets, follow the event on Twitter @TheEuropas and on Facebook. But you only have three days left (Friday 7 October is the deadline) to enter yourself or your startup. Heres how.
