A book deal that Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, signed only six months ago has fallen through, according to a report in The Guardian on Wednesday, but Canongate, his publisher in Britain, said it was still expecting to publish the book. Canongate did not provide a date for its release, however. According to The Guardian report, Mr. Assange, left, had expressed concern that the memoir could be used against him by prosecutors in the United States. American officials have been weighing whether to try to charge Mr. Assange since WikiLeaks released a trove of State Department cables, but it is unclear where that effort stands. The book deal was announced in December; Mr. Assange said he expected to earn $1.7 million for the memoir, which was being ghostwritten by Andrew O&rsquo;Hagan, a novelist. The memoir was originally scheduled for publication in April 2011 in Britain, although Mr. Assange&rsquo;s American publisher, Knopf, did not release a publication date. &ldquo;With projects like these, you never know about delivery, and you never know about timetables,&rdquo; said Paul Bogaards, a spokesman for Knopf, part of Random House. &ldquo;My understanding is that the book has been postponed.&rdquo;
