ATHENS &mdash; Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton on Sunday emphasized Washington&rsquo;s &ldquo;strong support&rdquo; for Greece&rsquo;s commitment to right its debt-ridden economy through tough austerity measures, and she thanked the government for its contributions to NATO-led operations in Libya and&nbsp;diplomatic efforts in the Middle East.        

On her first visit to Athens as secretary of state, Mrs. Clinton said at a news conference that Greece could rely on the United States&rsquo; unequivocal support in its efforts to emerge from a debt crisis that has shaken the euro zone and rattled the global economy.        

&ldquo;We stand by the people and government of Greece as you put your country back on a path to economic stability and prosperity,&rdquo; Mrs. Clinton said, noting that such progress was essential for the United States, too. &ldquo;We have a lot riding on our relationship together.&rdquo;        

At the news conference, held with the Greek foreign minister, Stavros Lambrinidis, she praised the determination of the government to impose a raft of austerity measures that Parliament approved last month amid violent street protests. She described the initiatives as &ldquo;vital first steps and acts of leadership.&rdquo;        

Comparing the measures to &ldquo;bitter medicine&rdquo; and &ldquo;the chemotherapy to get rid of the cancer,&rdquo; she emphasized that the price of inaction would have been much higher.        

&ldquo;Greece has inspired the world before, and I have every confidence that you are doing so again,&rdquo; Mrs. Clinton said. She also praised moves aimed at&nbsp;encouraging business activity and investment in Greece.&nbsp;        

Her visit &mdash; the second leg of a 12-stop diplomatic tour that started in Turkey &mdash; comes as Greece prepares for an emergency meeting on Thursday in Brussels, where the leaders of the 17 euro zone&nbsp;countries will attempt to&nbsp;hammer&nbsp;out&nbsp;a deal on a second bailout.        

Mr. Lambrinidis said Sunday that Greece had already made progress. &ldquo;The Greece of today is nothing like Greece two years ago,&rdquo; he said.        

The Socialist government&rsquo;s success in pushing through the unpopular austerity measures, he added, had saved Greece, which had been downgraded several times by international credit rating agencies. &ldquo;Many had gambled on the collapse of Greece and of Europe,&rdquo; Mr. Lambrinidis said. &ldquo;But all have been proven wrong, and we will continue to prove them wrong.&rdquo;        

He acknowledged Washington&rsquo;s support for Greece. &ldquo;Friends show their worth in the difficult times,&rdquo; he said.        

Mrs. Clinton also expressed gratitude for Greece&rsquo;s &ldquo;partnership on a shared agenda that spans the globe.&rdquo; She cited the NATO-led Libya operation, which uses military bases on the Aegean island of Crete, and Greek efforts to stop a flotilla challenging the Israeli blockade of Gaza.        

&ldquo;At a moment when domestic issues are rightly taking center stage in Greece, we remain grateful for Greece&rsquo;s continued engagement in meeting the shared challenges we face,&rdquo; she said.        

She and Mr. Lambrinidis also discussed developments in the Balkans and efforts to integrate the western Balkan states into NATO, as well as the ongoing talks aimed at reunifying Cyprus &mdash; long a divisive issue between Greece and Turkey. &nbsp;
