Huawei has its sights set on the US market. The Chinese manufacturer aims to be within the United States top 5 mobile phone companies within the three years. In order to reach that goal the company needs some impressive hardware  and marketing. The Huawei Ascend D Quad is a fine entry into the smartphone race and now, with the MediaPad 10 FHD, Huawei has a legitimate tablet as well.The MediaPad 10 FHD packs a punch. Under the 10.1-inch 1920 x 1200 IPS display rests a quad-core CPU and 16-core GPU, which the company promises will provide Smooth GameExperience. The MediaPads back houses an 8MP camera and the tablet measures in at just 8.8mm thick. To top it all off, the tablet will ship with an LTE radio. No word on cost or availabilityjust yet, but if priced right, this Android 4.0 tab could give the Galaxy Tab 10.1 and Asus Transformer line some serious competition.
