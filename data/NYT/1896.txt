A team of mountaineers led by a veteran Sherpa guide flew Wednesday to Mount Everest on an expedition to clear away tons of trash left on the world&rsquo;s highest peak. Since Everest was first conquered in 1953, thousands of people have climbed it, often leaving behind empty oxygen bottles, ropes, tents and other items. Nepal now requires climbers to bring down everything they take up the mountain or lose their deposit, but debris from past climbs still litters the slopes. The team that left Katmandu on Wednesday &mdash; led by Apa, a Sherpa who has climbed Everest a record 20 times and who uses only one name &mdash; plans to bring down 11,000 pounds of garbage. Expedition members, porters and guides of other expeditions will carry the garbage down the mountain, receiving 100 rupees, or about $1.40, for every kilogram they haul out.
