Eight days after King Abdullah II fired his cabinet and named a new prime minister, the rest of the new government was sworn in on Wednesday. The 27-member cabinet included a number of holdovers &mdash; notably the foreign, interior and economy ministers &mdash; as well as a few leftists. The opposition Muslim Brotherhood, which declined an invitation to be part of the government, said it was less interested in who held the portfolios than what they would do. Prime Minister Marouf al-Bakhit promised to institute a fairer election law and a more liberal public assembly law. The government was expected to maintain its close ties to the United States.
