An Italian fugitive convicted of four murders in the 1970s left prison a free man on Thursday after Brazil&rsquo;s top court banned his extradition. The decision to release the fugitive, Cesare Battisti, left, a former leftist militant who escaped from an Italian prison in 1981, produced outrage from Italy, with Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi saying it &ldquo;wounds our sense of justice and also those who have suffered in those cases.&rdquo; Italy&rsquo;s Foreign Ministry said it would pursue all legal means to obtain Mr. Battisti&rsquo;s extradition, including appealing to the international court in The Hague. Mr. Battisti, who says he is innocent, was granted asylum by Brazil&rsquo;s president, Luiz In&aacute;cio Lula da Silva, on his last day in office in December. The Brazilian Supreme Court, in a 6-3 vote on Wednesday night, upheld that decision, ruling that it was a sovereign act of government and not subject to an extradition treaty.
