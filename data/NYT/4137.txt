An entire 20-member police force in the northern city of Ascensi&oacute;n resigned Thursday after a series of attacks killed three officers. The resignation leaves the city&rsquo;s 24,000 residents without local police services, the chief state prosecutor said. State and federal police officers have moved in to take over police work. Three of the town&rsquo;s officers were killed by gunmen on Tuesday. There have been at least three attacks on police stations in the city in the last month.
