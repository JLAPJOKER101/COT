Provincial officials in Guangdong Province have canceled the results of recent elections in the seaside fishing village of Wukan, which evicted all its Communist Party officials this month over a land dispute, according to the state news agency. The cancellation of the election results was an attempt to appease the villagers, who have complained about the corruption of village officials and say they want genuine elections where they can put into power people they trust. Villagers&rsquo; protests received prominent coverage by the foreign and Hong Kong news media after they took over governance of the village this month following the death of a village advocate in police custody. It is unclear when or how new party officials will be selected to govern Wukan.
