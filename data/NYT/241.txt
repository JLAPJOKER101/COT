Police officers have detained 96 people on suspicion of illegally using tainted milk powder that should have been destroyed after a food scandal that angered and frightened parents across China in 2008, state news organizations reported Friday.  That year at least 22 dairy companies were found to have sold products tainted with melamine, an industrial chemical that can be toxic to infants; at least six babies died of kidney problems and 300,000 children fell ill. Among the 96 people detained, 17 have been convicted on criminal charges and 2 have been sentenced to life in prison. Thirty-eight others are awaiting trial and 41 are being investigated.
