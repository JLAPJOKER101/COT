A Russian official said Monday that if talks with the United States on missile defense broke down, Russia was prepared to deploy tactical missiles to Belarus, the southern region of Krasnodar and the western enclave of Kaliningrad. The deployment would ensure that American interceptor missiles could not neutralize Russia&rsquo;s nuclear capability, a military official told Interfax, speaking on the condition of anonymity. President Dmitri A. Medvedev said Monday that Russia&rsquo;s response to the American missile shield &ldquo;should not close the door to negotiation.&rdquo;
