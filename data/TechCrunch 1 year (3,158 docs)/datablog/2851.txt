Social media dashboard company HootSuite has raised $3 million in new funding according to a new SEC filing. HootSuite has previously raised $1.2 million from Blumberg Capital, Hearst Ventures and Geoff Entress. HootSuite offers brands and businesses a comprehensive social media dashboard that allows teams to collaboratively schedule and monitor updates to Twitter, Facebook, Linkedin, WordPress and other social networks via web, desktop or mobile platforms. Via the applications, HootSuite users can also track campaign results, analytics and other data. In two years, HootSuite has grown to over 1.5 million users worldwide, is cash-flow positive, and recently bought an add-on for the Firefox 4 browser called TwitterBar, which enables users to post to a variety of social networks straight from the web address bar.  HootSuite was also the first application in which Twitter began testing its own in-stream ad product. Weve contacted the company for confirmation and will update when we hear back.
