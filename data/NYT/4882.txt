Several thousand followers of the anti-American cleric Moktada al-Sadr took to the streets in Iraqi cities on Friday, calling for the government to provide more electricity and jobs. Far fewer people took part in the protests on Friday than in previous demonstrations organized by Mr. Sadr, a Shiite. In the Shiite neighborhood of Sadr City in Baghdad, slightly fewer than 1,000 people protested for about 20 minutes immediately after prayers on Friday. In addition, about 3,000 followers of Mr. Sadr protested in Najaf.
