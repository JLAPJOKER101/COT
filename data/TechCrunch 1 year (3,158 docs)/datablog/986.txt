iPhone unlocks are usually a tetchy experience  you have to have the right firmware on the right model iPhone at the right time. Now, however, thanks to a method that spoofs the activation server, you can unlock almost any iPhone semi-permanently.The system, called Subscriber Artificial Module or SAM, requires a jailbroken iPhone and Cydia. To run it, you de-activate your phone, insert a new SIM, and then activate SAM. SAM spoofs the activation process, convincing the phone that it has been unlocked properly and without issues.Built by hackers Loktar_Sun and Laforet, the process isnt for the faint of heart and it takes twenty-eight steps. You can follow along at iClarified where theyve outlined the entire process in meticulous detail.Because youre not really unlocking the phone but in fact activating it using an unsupported SIM, expect some wonky server issues. You will also have to go back and reactivate the device later if you decide to switch SIMs. Its a small price to pay for freedom.
