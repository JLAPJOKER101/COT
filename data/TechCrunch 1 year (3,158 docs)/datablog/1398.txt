Moshi Monsters is on a licensing roll these days. There have new toys, comics and now Mind Candy, the company behind it, has signed a deal with Sony Music on a 12-track album dubbed Music Rox which will feature songs from popular Moshi characters like Dr Strangeglove, Big Bad Bill and Sweettooth. This is just the start of a series of albums. Given that Sony has experience taking reality stars mainstream theres no reason it cant do the same with another bunch of monsters.An estimated 60 million children between 6-12 years old now play the game and cant get enough of the Moshi brand.Jason Perry, head of Moshi Music and a former producer for McFly and The Pussycat Dolls, told The Sunday Telegraph: “Moshi Monsters has never released an album before so this is a big opportunity. The thinking behind it is that we don’t want the company to just be a computer brand. We want to turn it into the number one children’s brand.”The album will be on sale from iTunes from April 2.
