MyHealthTeams, which develops social and local networks for communities of people living with or caring for those living with chronic health conditions, is launching MyAutismTeam, an online community for parents of children on the autism spectrum.MyHealthTeams says that MyAutismTeam is the first social network catered specifically for parents of children with autism, with the aim of helping parents connect with other who have had similar experiences.Parents can share recommendations of local providers, openly discuss issues, share tips, and gain access to local services. Since debuting over the summer, the site has grown from 30 to over 12,500 members. On the MyAutismTeam site, parents create a team of autism doctors and specialists, restaurants, schools, piano teachers, babysitters and more.Parents can then communicate and post status updates around daily activities like dentist or doctor’s visits. Members can also post on each other’s walls and use the site’s searchable database to find autism-friendly providers near them. And organization Autism Speaks helped seed MyAutismTeam’s database of local autism providers with data from its own family resource database.MyHealthTeams is also currently developing MyBreastCancerTeam, a network for cancer patients and survivors.
