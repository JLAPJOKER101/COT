PARIS &mdash; France&rsquo;s president, Nicolas Sarkozy, looking drawn and dour, returned here late Thursday with a sobering message for his austerity-weary country.        

&ldquo;We have entered a new world,&rdquo; Mr. Sarkozy said in a nationally televised interview, his first in more than eight months of turmoil that has seen investors&rsquo; confidence in France&rsquo;s financial system shaken by its heavy exposure to debt-ridden Greece. Presenting himself as &ldquo;protector&rdquo; of France, he warned that the nation&rsquo;s new commitments under the plan to rescue Greece and the euro would require greater economic discipline.        

&ldquo;If we want to defend the French social model,&rdquo; Mr. Sarkozy said in an almost fatherly tone, &ldquo;we will need to take the necessary measures.&rdquo;        

Six months before a re-election campaign that has yet to begin formally, Mr. Sarkozy &mdash; already at the nadir of his popularity &mdash; painted a pessimistic picture of slowing growth and deeper spending cuts aimed at shoring up France&rsquo;s credibility with financial markets. And while he did not directly take aim at his main opponent, the Socialist Fran&ccedil;ois Hollande, he dismissed keystones of past Socialist governments, including the 35-hour workweek and a minimum retirement age of 60, as untenable vestiges of a pre-crisis era.        

&ldquo;We will have to revise and adapt our budget plan to the new reality,&rdquo; Mr. Sarkozy told an estimated 12 million viewers as he revealed that his government had lowered its forecast for next year&rsquo;s gross domestic product growth to 1 percent from 1.75 percent. To compensate for an anticipated decline in 2012 tax revenues, he said that by mid-November he would announce a program of budget cuts of about $8.5 billion to $11.3 billion.        

&ldquo;It&rsquo;s because of this debt crisis that we find ourselves in a situation of having to defend France&rsquo;s triple-A&rdquo; credit rating, Mr. Sarkozy said, noting that a rating downgrade would only increase the interest burden on the country&rsquo;s public debt, already at more than $70 billion a year.        

Mr. Sarkozy&rsquo;s message of restraint, however, rang hollow to his opponents.        

&ldquo;This is a convenient window-dressing,&rdquo; Mr. Hollande said in an interview published Friday in Le Monde. It was Mr. Sarkozy, he said, &ldquo;who in 2007 went to our European partners to warn them that he would not respect the commitments made by his predecessor in terms of deficit reduction. It was he who granted 75 billion euros in tax breaks that have eroded the public accounts.&rdquo;        

&ldquo;He cannot escape his record,&rdquo; Mr. Hollande added.        

Mr. Hollande was also critical of the plan agreed to Thursday by leaders of the euro zone to solve the European debt crisis, calling it &ldquo;incomplete and insufficient.&rdquo;        

While the zone has &ldquo;avoided the worst,&rdquo; he said, he faulted its leaders for not making more progress on economic policy coordination and noted that Mr. Sarkozy had failed to persuade his European counterparts to allow the newly created bailout fund access to money from the European Central Bank. &ldquo;There is no permanent resolution,&rdquo; he said.        

Mr. Hollande called plans to invite foreign governments &mdash; particularly China &mdash; to invest in the bailout fund as &ldquo;deeply troubling&rdquo; and an &ldquo;admission of weakness.&rdquo;        

&ldquo;Are we supposed to imagine that if China comes to the aid of the euro zone, it will do so without expecting anything in return?&rdquo; he asked Thursday in a statement.        

But Mr. Sarkozy, who discussed the debt deal with China&rsquo;s president, Hu Jintao, on Thursday, defended the plan.        

&ldquo;China has a major role to play,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;China must deploy more resources to stimulate the world economy. If they decide to invest in the euro rather than the dollar, why reject that?&rdquo;        

Mr. Sarkozy, 56, has yet to declare his candidacy in presidential elections scheduled for April and May. A poll of 859 registered voters age 18 and over, by the French polling group C.S.A., suggested that Mr. Hollande, 57, would capture 62 percent of the vote in a two-way contest, compared with 38 percent for Mr. Sarkozy, were the election held when the poll was taken, on Oct. 17.
