The Chinese ocean monitoring agency is adding ships and personnel to beef up enforcement of maritime claims, the state-run newspaper China Daily reported Monday. China Marine Surveillance said it would add 1,000 officers this year, increasing its staffing to 10,000 people, and would purchase 36 new ships over the next five years. The agency now has 300 vessels and 10 aircraft. The newspaper said the increases were needed to deal with a rising number of disputes.
