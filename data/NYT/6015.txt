President Michel Martelly on Friday put off a plan to reinstate Haiti&rsquo;s armed forces until a commission he plans to appoint next week reports on the best way to proceed. The plan to bring back the military, disbanded in 1995 after years of participating in coups and human rights abuses, has been criticized by diplomats, who believe fortifying the national police would be the better use of resources. But Mr. Martelly, playing up national pride as much as security, promised the new military would be apolitical and could eventually replace United Nations peacekeepers, in place since 2004.
