President Nicolas Sarkozy sent a handwritten message of support to his embattled foreign minister, Mich&egrave;le Alliot-Marie, on Wednesday, the day after embarrassing new revelations about her Christmas visit to Tunisia with her husband and her parents. Not only did she accept two free flights from a businessman close to the family of the deposed president, Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali, but her parents bought a real estate company from the same businessman on the trip. Ms. Alliot-Marie said the investment had nothing to do with her, but there were new calls for her resignation, including in an editorial in Le Monde.
