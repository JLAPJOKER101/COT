Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi on Tuesday withdrew a disputed clause of the country&rsquo;s austerity bill that would have allowed one of his family&rsquo;s companies to temporarily avoid a heavy fine in a legal dispute. Under the measure, part of the $68 billion bill, companies could ask that especially high fines be suspended as long as appeals were pending. Fininvest, the Berlusconis&rsquo; holding company for family assets, was fined $1.09 billion in 2009 for bribery, and a decision by a Milan appeals court is expected this week. Mr. Berlusconi said the measure was &ldquo;necessary&rdquo; to protect &ldquo;companies and citizens.&rdquo;
