A Tibetan monk in Sichuan Province tried committing suicide on Wednesday by setting himself on fire to protest Chinese rule in Tibetan areas, according to two Tibet advocacy groups, International Campaign for Tibet and Free Tibet, based outside China. The fate of the monk, Phuntsog, was unclear by nighttime, but there were rumors he had died. He was the second monk at Kirti Monastery to protest Chinese policies through self-immolation. In 2009, another monk did the same, but survived. This month is the third anniversary of an uprising against Chinese rule that rippled across Tibetan areas in March 2008. Kirti Monastery was a center of protests in Sichuan.
