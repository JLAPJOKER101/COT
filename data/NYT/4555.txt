The Turkish military said Monday that it had killed more than 150 Kurdish separatists this month with artillery fire and airstrikes in northern Iraq that were carried out in retaliation for increased cross-border violence. The rebels, who are fighting for autonomy in southeast Turkey, often operate out of bases in northern Iraq, where the Iraqi Kurds have achieved a level of autonomy of their own. The rebels &mdash; from the P.K.K., or Kurdistan Workers Party &mdash; have refused to stop fighting unless demands like the release of a jailed leader and public education in the Kurdish language are met by the Turkish government.
