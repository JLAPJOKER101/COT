The police in Guyana say record prices for gold have led to killings, robberies and other crimes across the country. The police commissioner, Henry Greene, said Friday that the 26 killings this year in gold mines near the borders with Venezuela and Brazil are linked to surging gold prices. The most recent slayings occurred on Thursday. Police said a miner was shot to death and his son was beaten and buried alive with the help of an excavator. The price of gold hit a new high of nearly $1,830 an ounce on Thursday.
