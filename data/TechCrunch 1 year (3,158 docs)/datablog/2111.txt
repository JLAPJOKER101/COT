A stylist will then call/contact the customers via their preferred method of communication. Once the stylist gets an idea of the customers style, he or she will send a trunk, of clothes and ship out via Fedex a handpicked collection of shoes, pants, shirts, and more. You keep what you like and send back what doesnt fit.For Trunk Club, Chesney will help the company continue to expand. As COO, Chesney will oversee customer acquisition efforts, help develop the technology platform, and streamline operations for sales and fulfillment.Trunk Club is definitely seeing traction amongst users.
