Im in absolute love. From the gorgeous wood cabinet to the technical capabilities, the little Vers 1Q is simply perfect. The $120 price ($99 for Kickstarters) is just icing on the cake. Its rather refreshing to see a warm, nearly alive device in our world thats generally filled with modeled plastic and faux chrome trim. Simply put, the 1Q is a battery-powered Bluetooth speaker. A 2-inch driver provides the audio while, packed inside the walnut or bamboo casing, a 6.5W amp powers the audio provided from either Bluetooth or the 3.5mm jack. The included battery charges via microUSB and should last 10 hours on a charge. What more can you ask for from a small speaker?As shown by the pictures, the whole package is of a modest size. It fits in the hand, yet the creator brags that it can easily deliver enough sound to fill some pretty large spaces. Since it works with Bluetooth or an aux input, it should work with nearly every device. This isnt Vers first consumer electronic device. The company already sells the Vers 1.5R radio/alarm, Vers 1E ear buds, and iPhone/iPad cases  all out of bamboo and walnut.The project is already funded on Kickstarter but they are still taking orders for 18 more days. Pledge $95 for a 1Q made out of either bamboo or walnut. Or, pledge an additional $30 for the limited edition red beech edition. Best yet the Vers promises these things will be delivered well before the holidays.
