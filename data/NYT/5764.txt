Israeli forces killed two Palestinians in the northern Gaza Strip on Thursday shortly after two snipers on motorcycles fired at Israeli troops patrolling the border fence, witnesses said. The Israeli military said its soldiers, aided by the air force, hit the terrorist squad, but the witnesses said that the snipers managed to flee and that those killed were farmers. The armed wing of Hamas said that one of those killed was a member, but that he was not taking part in fighting at the time.
