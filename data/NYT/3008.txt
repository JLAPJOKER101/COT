Russia&rsquo;s investigative committee announced Thursday that it had enough evidence to prove that Rustam Makhmudov, a fugitive arrested in Chechnya on Tuesday, was hired to kill the journalist Anna Politkovskaya. He has been charged with her 2006 murder, and with kidnapping and extortion related to cases from the 1990s, prosecutors said. Murad Musayev, a lawyer who has represented Mr. Makhmudov&rsquo;s family, said this week that Mr. Makhmudov had nothing to do with the crime and has long sought to turn himself in and cooperate with investigators.
