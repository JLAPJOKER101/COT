You guys! You guys! TechCrunch totally got mentioned in The Onion!Its been a pretty one-sided relationship until now, with the fabled satirical newspaper remaining aloof despite several overtures on our end. Its almost like The Onion staff thought it was totally cooler than us.Not today, though. Today, were the stars of this post about the new Basmati smartphone from Uncle Bens. (Note: Thats not a real smartphone.) Granted, were not in the headline, or in the first couple of paragraphs, but once paragraph five starts, we are on it:As first reported by TechCrunch and the USA Rice Council, the Basmati will feature a 5.3-inch display with a density of 285 pixels per inch, a dual-core 1.5 gigahertz processor, and two gigabytes of RAM, as well as a robust set of entertainment features that includes a rear-mounted 8-megapixel autofocus camera, dozens of preloaded stir-fry recipes, and Adobe Flash support.Thats right, TechCrunch totally plays a key supporting role in one of the jokes. Now if youll excuse me, I need to call my mom and tell her that weve made it.[image via flickr/terren in Virginia]
