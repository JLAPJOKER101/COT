The Inter-American Court on Human Rights ruled on Friday that Venezuela must allow Leopoldo L&oacute;pez, a prominent opposition leader, to run for public office. The decision could shake up a presidential election scheduled for October 2012, opening the way for a strong opponent to run against President Hugo Ch&aacute;vez. Mr. L&oacute;pez, a former mayor of Chacao, a municipality in Caracas, was disqualified by Mr. Ch&aacute;vez&rsquo;s government from running because of legal claims against him from his time as mayor. Mr. L&oacute;pez argued that the disqualification, a method used by Venezuela&rsquo;s government against other opposition figures, amounted to political discrimination. In a statement, the Foreign Ministry called the ruling &ldquo;politically partial.&rdquo; Venezuela is believed to be required to respect the decision by the court, a judicial entity of the Organization of American States.
