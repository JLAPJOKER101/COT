It just makes sense that the failure of Facebook to spectacularly IPO would affect all markets public and private right?But especially the companies, public or private, that are contingent upon, tethered to, Facebook  like well Zynga, and Quora and Fab and most social Consumer Internet startups really.So, as someone who has no idea what money she has and where it is invested, please dont pay attention to any financial advice I may have  I clearly have no idea what Im talking about.BUT (big but)  We just had Paul Graham write an emailÂ that many have already deemed to be RIP Good Times part deux to his portfolio companies. And you should pay attention, because whos smarter than Paul right? No one that I know of.But (smaller but), all is not lost, as Ive spent all day chasing down the fact that companies who are real businesses stand to benefit from the current expected suppression in private market funding, if (caveat) they are actually a business.And, because of a standard lag time in perception, if you are raising funding and still havent figured everything out, you still have about six months to raise all you can. Investors have been holding cash waiting for valuations to go down apparently. So yeah, fyi.
