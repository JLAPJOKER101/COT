MOSCOW &mdash; In the aftermath of the plane crash that decimated a beloved Russian hockey team last week, fans clung to one filament of hope: a single player, 26-year-old Aleksandr Galimov, had somehow survived, staggering from the wreckage under his own power and telling a pair of astonished police officers, &ldquo;Brothers, I am Galimov.&rdquo;        

Over the next five days, Mr. Galimov became a sort of talisman for fans, who flowed out into the street in the tens of thousands to grieve the loss of the team, Yaroslavl Lokomotiv.        

The crowd that converged on the team&rsquo;s arena chanted &ldquo;Galimov, live for the whole team&rdquo; and &ldquo;Sanya, fight!&rdquo; Though his injuries were grave &mdash; he had burns to his respiratory tract and covering 90 percent of his body &mdash; fans on one Web site asked people &ldquo;not to discuss the topic,&rdquo; as if they could keep him alive through sheer force of will.        

Five days after the crash, Mr. Galimov died on Monday, administrators at a Moscow burn clinic told the Interfax news service. His death brings the toll of the catastrophe to 44 and deepens what is already being called the greatest tragedy in the history of Russian hockey. The sole remaining survivor is a member of the crew, Aleksandr Sizov, who is reported to be in stable condition.        

Aleksandr V. Nabokov, who edits a Web site devoted to sports in Yaroslavl, Lokomotiv&rsquo;s home city, 160 miles northeast of Moscow, said the grief seemed to reach its apogee over the weekend. The crowd of mourners numbered up to 100,000, according to Russian news outlets. With the news of Mr. Galimov&rsquo;s death, Mr. Nabokov said, &ldquo;most people feel emptiness inside them.&rdquo;        

&ldquo;Sasha wasn&rsquo;t any worse or better than the rest of them, but he survived,&rdquo; Mr. Nabokov said. &ldquo;People saw him as the last ray of light in this darkness. The team perished, and so he came to personify the whole team. That is why they reacted this way.&rdquo;        

Most of Russia has now seen footage of the wreckage of the plane, which struggled to gain altitude on takeoff and crashed about a mile from the end of the runway, scattering seared wreckage over a tributary of the Volga River.        

Oleg Smirnov, a police officer, described arriving at the scene moments after the crash to see a man standing in shallow water, tearing off what remained of his flaming T-shirt and saying, &ldquo;Brothers, help me.&rdquo;        

&ldquo;At first we thought maybe he was a fisherman who happened to be sitting on the riverbank and was splashed by burning kerosene,&rdquo; Officer Smirnov said. The man was already in the ambulance when the officers asked his name, Lt. Dmitri Konoplyov told Komsomolskaya Pravda.        

&ldquo;He whispered, &lsquo;Brothers, I am Galimov,&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; Lieutenant Konoplyov said.        

Fans formed groups with names like &ldquo;Aleksandr Galimov Is Alive!&rdquo; and posted regular updates on his condition. Mr. Galimov was a hometown hero in Yaroslavl, where he began training at age 5, and was expected to compete in the 2014 Winter Olympics in Russia&rsquo;s Black Sea resort town of Sochi.        

Safety officials have said pilot error or a technical malfunction might have contributed to the crash. The International Aviation Committee announced on Monday that its inspectors found no problems with the engines, stabilizers or flaps on the plane, a Soviet-era Yak-42. Its weight was normal at the time of takeoff, and preflight control checks were in order, the committee said.        

President Dmitri A. Medvedev met with hockey officials on Monday to discuss gradually rebuilding the team, which he said would be &ldquo;the best monument to those who have been killed.&rdquo; He called the crash &ldquo;an absolutely unprecedented tragedy, a tragedy which has never happened in Russian sports,&rdquo; and promised to compensate the families of the deceased, including fulfilling the players&rsquo; contracts.        

In Yaroslavl, many fans have been venting their anger at the government, saying the team&rsquo;s game schedule and transportation plans were disrupted by a Kremlin-backed political forum held in its arena last week.        

&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all based on emotions,&rdquo; Mr. Nabokov said. &ldquo;People want to know &mdash; must know &mdash; who is to blame for the death of those who are near to them. They need an explanation, even when all the answers are right there on the surface.&rdquo;        

On Monday, a few fans visited the clinic where Mr. Galimov died, visibly struggling not to cry, and wove flowers between the bars of an iron fence.        

&ldquo;We thought if he survived, Lokomotiv would survive,&rdquo; said Vassili Kurilov, 22. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no team without him. He was the last one.&rdquo;
