President Felipe Calder&oacute;n appointed the head of the national intelligence agency, Alejandro Poir&eacute;, as the new interior minister on Thursday, replacing Francisco Blake Mora, who died in a helicopter crash last week. Mr. Poir&eacute;, 40, had been the director of the intelligence agency since September and was previously the national security spokesman, where he was the public face of the government&rsquo;s drug war. As the top domestic security chief, he will now oversee that effort.
