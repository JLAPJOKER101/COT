Prosecutors said Tuesday that their primary line of investigation in the killing of an activist who had criticized the police was the possibility that he had ties to organized crime. The activist, Nepomuceno Moreno, had accused police officers of kidnapping his 18-year-old son last year. He was shot to death on Monday in the northern state of Sonora. Members of the group that had served as a platform for Mr. Moreno, the Movement for Peace with Justice and Dignity, said state and federal authorities did not protect him when he requested it; the authorities said they had not received any requests for protection. Mr. Moreno&rsquo;s son is still missing.
