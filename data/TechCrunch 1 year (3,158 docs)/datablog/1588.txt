NewME Accelerator, the incubator launched last year to support minority entrepreneurs, just announced its latest group of startups.In her blog post about the new class (NewMEs second), founder and CEO Angela Benton also talks about the success rate of the first group of NewME alums — 60 percent of them have raised money, adding up to a little more than $500,000 in total funding. For the current class, Benton says NewME received more than 300 applications. This years program will be based in the Hub San Francisco co-working space. Participants in the 12-week program dont receive funding from NewME, but they get to live and work with a community of entrepreneurs, and they also receive mentorship and access to services from NewME partners. (Last month, the program added Andreessen Horowitz as a partner and sponsor.) In exchange, NewME takes a 4 percent stake in the company.Even though the second session is just about to start, NewME is already accepting applications for the next class, which starts in August. While most of the promotion around NewME has focused on African-American entrepreneurs, the program is also interested in companies with founders and CEOs from other underrepresented minorities, namely those who are women or Latinos.Here are the new companies (the descriptions come from NewME):The Modul.us
