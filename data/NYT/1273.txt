The police conducted a major crackdown on the &rsquo;Ndrangheta crime syndicate on Tuesday, arresting scores of suspects in Italy and Germany and seeking more in countries as far away as Canada and Australia. The cross-border operation shows how the &rsquo;Ndrangheta has extended its reach well beyond its original base in the southern Italian region of Calabria. Thirty-one suspects were picked up in Italy, the Italian police said. Six suspects, all Italian citizens, were apprehended in Germany, German and Italian officials said.
