Apple users probably have more than enough media on their iDevices to keep them entertained on the go, but Sony Network Entertainment President Tim Schaaff thinks theres room for another media service on iOS. According to VentureBeat, the companys Music Unlimited streaming service will be hitting Apples mobile platform some time in Q1 2012.In addition to simply streaming music from the Music Unlimited catalog, users will be able save cache their playlists for offline streaming at a later time. The service is already available on Android devices (not to mention several of Sonys own products) so its more than a little surprising that it will soon make the iOS leap. Its especially puzzling because there is already no shortage of competitors in the streaming music space. As VentureBeat notes, rivals Spotify and Rdio have been on iOS for quite some time now, and already offer a similar feature set.Really, its problem that all new entrants to this space have to deal with. As Eric Schmidt would probably say, it all comes down to differentiation. Rara, a relatively new streaming music service that launched this past December, is a great example. While they peg their service as being tuned for the non-tech savvy, their other main differentiator was that they launched simultaneously in multiple markets worldwide where some of the bigger services have yet to make a splash. While its still early to say if the approach is actually sustainable, Ive got to give them credit for taking a different approach.In this case, Sonys appearance on iOS probably holds considerable appeal for people who have already invested heavily into the Sony media/hardware ecosystem, but its going to be a tough sell for anyone who doesnt have some sort of pre-existing allegiance to the Japanese giant. I wish them the best  more competition is always good  but I look forward to seeing how many iOS users adopt it.
