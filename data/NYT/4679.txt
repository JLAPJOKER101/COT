At least 14 people have been killed in violence between Christian and Muslim youths in central Nigeria&rsquo;s volatile Plateau State since Sunday night, the authorities said. With the latest deaths, at least 50 people have been killed in the ethnically and religiously mixed area in the last week. The authorities said the violence began when Christian youths attacked some Muslims as they gathered to celebrate the end of Ramadan in Jos, the capital of Plateau State. Plateau State straddles Nigeria&rsquo;s mostly Muslim north and largely Christian south.
