Bill Richardson, the former governor of New Mexico, arrived in Cuba on Wednesday to seek the release of an American sentenced to 15 years in prison for bringing communications equipment to the island illegally. It was the first sign that the intensifying calls for the release of the American, Alan Gross, might bear fruit after months of false hopes. A lawyer for Mr. Gross said that Mr. Richardson, a former ambassador to the United Nations, had made the trip at the invitation of the Cuban government. A State Department spokeswoman, Victoria Nuland, said the Obama administration was aware of the trip and was in contact with Mr. Richardson. Mr. Richardson, who was staying at Hotel Nacional in Havana, said he had no comment on what he hoped to accomplish in Cuba.
