The sister of President Felipe Calder&oacute;n lost a tight race for governor of his home state, Michoac&aacute;n, in an election marred by threats and violence attributed to organized crime. Luisa Mar&iacute;a Calder&oacute;n, who like her brother belongs to the conservative National Action Party, lost by two percentage points to Fausto Vallejo Figueroa, the candidate of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, which is making an aggressive effort to retake the presidency next year. Mr. Vallejo garnered 35 percent of the vote, Ms. Calder&oacute;n, 33 percent, and a candidate from the Democratic Revolutionary Party, which has dominated there recently, got 29 percent. Ms. Calder&oacute;n had hoped to score a symbolic victory for the party, which is trailing in presidential polls. But it has lost several recent elections for governor there.
