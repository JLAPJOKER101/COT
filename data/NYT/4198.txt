Russia marked the third anniversary of its war with Georgia on Monday by saying it would not renew ties with Georgia as long as President Mikheil Saakashvili was in power there. &ldquo;We will have no dealings with a man who gave the criminal order to kill peacekeepers and ordered the death of peaceful civilians, including Russian citizens,&rdquo; Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said. He called Mr. Saakashvili &ldquo;a pathological case&rdquo; who was &ldquo;very badly brought up.&rdquo;
