Foxconn, a Taiwanese technology company, is discussing a $12 billion deal to manufacture displays for computers and tablets in Brazil, Brazilian officials said Tuesday. The technology giant would build a plant in Brazil that would employ about 100,000 workers, including 20,000 engineers, Aloizio Mercadante, Brazil&rsquo;s minister of science and technology, told reporters in Beijing on Tuesday. Foxconn could encounter labor issues in Brazil: the country is facing a shortage of technology professionals estimated at 92,000 this year, according to the Brazilian Association of Information Technology and Communication Companies, or Brasscom.
