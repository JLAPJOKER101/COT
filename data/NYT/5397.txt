The United Nations refugee agency said Friday that it had suspended nonessential operations at the Dadaab refugee camp as security forces scoured the area for two Spanish aid workers kidnapped there a day earlier. Kenyan security forces fanned out through the semiarid border area with Somalia, hunting abductors believed by the police to be part of a Somali Islamist rebel group, the Shabab. The Shabab have denied responsibility for the attack.
