TOKYO (Reuters) &mdash; Prime Minister Naoto Kan told his cabinet on Tuesday that he would announce his intention to resign on Friday, Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda said.        

Mr. Kan had canceled plans to meet with President Obama in Washington next month. His resignation would set in motion an election within his Democratic Party to choose a successor.        

Mr. Kan has faced increasing criticism for his handling of the Japanese government&rsquo;s response to the earthquake, tsunami and nuclear accident in March.
