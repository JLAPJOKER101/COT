Two government soldiers accused of killing a civilian and a soldier were executed on Monday, as the Western-backed government came under international pressure to hold its forces accountable for abuses. The Somali government, which recently took control of much of the capital, Mogadishu, after Islamist rebels withdrew, is hoping to gain support for a new humanitarian force to protect food aid convoys. &ldquo;Any soldier who kills a person or loots property or food at the market or in refugee camps will be executed likewise,&rdquo; the judge told reporters at the Mogadishu police academy where the soldiers had been blindfolded and tied to two poles and the sentence carried out. President Sheik Sharif Sheik Ahmed has declared a state of emergency in portions of Mogadishu abandoned this month by the Shabab, an Islamist rebel group.
