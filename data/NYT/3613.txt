In the latest crackdown on a form of protest that has been gathering strength in Belarus, the police arrested scores of people who were standing on sidewalks and clapping Wednesday, human rights groups said. The applauding protests began because authorities in President Aleksandr G. Lukashenko&rsquo;s government take more severe actions against traditional public political expression, like unfurling banners. The clapping protests are organized anonymously on social networking sites for Wednesday evenings and began last month. Some participants stand silently while others clap. Plainclothes police officers typically swoop in and grab those who applaud, sometimes roughing them up. Vesna, a Belarussian rights group, said the police detained about 150 clappers on Wednesday. After past protests, judges have sentenced clappers to 15 days in jail or a fine.
