NEW DELHI &mdash; Investigators here arrested the former chief organizer of the scandal-marred Commonwealth Games on Monday, after uncovering what they said were irregularities in the awarding of contracts for the international sporting event.        

Federal agents arrested the former official, Suresh Kalmadi, on charges that he had conspired to steer an inflated contract to a Swiss firm that provided timing equipment for the games, which were staged here in October. Investigators said the organizing committee for the games awarded a $33 million contract to the Swiss firm, even though the actual cost should have been roughly a third of that.        

Mr. Kalmadi&rsquo;s arrest comes as the governing Indian National Congress Party has been enmeshed in several ugly corruption scandals. The Commonwealth Games, a quadrennial competition mostly among countries of the former British Empire, became a source of national embarrassment for India because of myriad missed construction deadlines and inadequate preparations.        

Indians ultimately took pride in the performance of their athletes during the competitions, but were furious with the incompetent management on the part of organizers like Mr. Kalmadi. When Mr. Kalmadi spoke during the opening ceremony, the capacity crowd greeted him with catcalls and jeers.        

The Commonwealth Games cost roughly $6 billion, and Mr. Kalmadi is now the third top official of the organizing committee to be arrested on corruption charges. His arrest did not stop opposition political leaders on Monday from demanding that the government pursue a wider inquiry into the staging of the event.        

&ldquo;Suresh Kalmadi&rsquo;s arrest is the tip of the iceberg,&rdquo; said Nitin Gadkari, president of the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party.
