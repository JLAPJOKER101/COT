A Kurdish militant who had hijacked a ferry with 18 passengers on board Friday afternoon in northwestern Turkey was shot to death by Turkish commandos. The militant had threatened to detonate explosives if he failed to get media exposure, local officials said. The governor of Istanbul, Huseyin Avni Mutlu, told The Associated Press that the passengers were all safe and that the hijacker &ldquo;was a member of the terrorist organization.&rdquo; Earlier, Binali Yildirim, the transportation minister, told the semiofficial Anatolian News Agency that four or five militants, identifying themselves as members of a subdivision of the Kurdistan Workers Party, had overpowered the captain and demanded food and fuel. The ferry, named Kartepe, was en route to Golcuk from Izmit, both coastal towns on the Sea of Marmara.
