In addition, institutions including SK Ventures, Brand Ventures, and Launch Capital have also committed.The companys online service allows retailers to quickly set up online promotions, while also allowing brands to set up promotions that are automatically customized for local retailers use.Today, brands spend nearly $30 billion each year supporting retailers with offline materials, including in-store signage, yellow page ads and newspaper ads.
