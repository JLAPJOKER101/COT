Indian authorities cleared one of Tibetan Buddhism&rsquo;s most revered lamas on Friday in an investigation into $1.35 million in cash discovered last month at his headquarters in northern India, a news report said. Rajwant Sandhu, the top civil servant in Himachal Pradesh State, said the money found during a raid on the monastery of the Karmapa, above, Tibetan Buddhism&rsquo;s third most important leader, had been donated by his followers, the Press Trust of India news agency reported. The Karmapa had no links to the money since the affairs of his trust are managed by his followers, Ms. Sandhu said. &ldquo;The Karmapa is a revered religious leader of the Buddhists, and the government has no intentions to interfere in religious affairs of the Buddhists,&rdquo; she said, according to the P.T.I. Last week, the state police said the Karmapa&rsquo;s followers violated Indian tax and foreign currency laws in collecting the donations.
