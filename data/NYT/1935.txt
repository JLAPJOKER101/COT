The second-place finisher in the presidential runoff will not challenge the preliminary results, a spokesman said Friday. The candidate, Mirlande Manigat, a former first lady and senator, has doubts about the veracity of preliminary results that showed she won only 32 percent of the vote, but she will not file a challenge with the electoral council. That moves Michel Martelly, a popular singer who won nearly 68 percent of the vote, closer to official victory.
