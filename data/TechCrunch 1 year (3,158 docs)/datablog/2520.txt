Its nice and early in London, and Nokia CEO Stephen Elop has finally put to rest months of speculation by unveiling Nokias first batch of Windows Phones at the Nokia World conference. Its been a long time coming  news of a Nokia/Microsoft partnership first broke back in February  but Nokia has at long last debuted the Lumia 800 and the Lumia 710.Its been hinted at for months now, but the handset formerly known as the Searay has finally been revealed as the Lumia 800. Stephen Elop has called it the first real Windows Phone  quite a lofty claim, but does the hardware live up to it?The 800 sports a curved 3.7-inch WVGA ClearBlack AMOLED display, a single-core 1.4GHz processor, and 512MB of RAM. Mobile photographers will find much to like about the 8-megapixel camera with a f/2.2 Carl Zeiss lens, and the 16GB of onboard storage should hold quite a few cat pictures. The specs wont exactly set anyones world on fire, but the design might:  like the N9 before it, the Lumia 800 features a stunning unibody design thats shaped out of a slab of durable polycarbonate material. The style-conscious among you will also be glad to know that the Lumia 800 comes in three colors: black, cyan, and magenta. Surprisingly, the Lumia 800 is already on its way to France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and the UK in time for a November launch. Customers in Hong Kong, India, Russia, Singapore and Taiwan will be able to nab one by the end of the year, but domestic Windows Phones fans will have to wait until early 2012.
