There are a few lessons you could take away from the fact that FacebookIPODayClosingPrice.com exists right now:Heres the story: Angel investor and all-around web magnate Chris Sacca wrote a quick tweet early yesterday about how itd be cool if there was a website where people could predict where Facebooks stock will end up at the end of its first day as a publicly traded company. Horse races in general are always fun to watch, after all, and its definitely a conversation thats happening around many a watercooler now that Facebooks IPO is officially on for tomorrow morning.So a programmer named James Proud answered the call, hacking together FacebookIPODayClosingPrice.com, a fun little website that keeps a running tally of peoples bets on where Facebooks stock will close on IPO day.@sacca Ok! James Proud (@jamesproud) May 16, 2012The site, which went live yesterday afternoon, says it was quickly knocked together with Python, Tornado, Postgres, Redis, Heroku, no sleep and Bootstrap. Its pretty simple: Anyone with a Twitter account can sign in and place his or her bet on what price Facebooks stock will be at market close tomorrow afternoon.Some big names in the web have weighed in on the site already: Chris Sacca thinks it will close at $56, while Chris Dixon predicts a slightly more modest $50.And whats the general consensus at the moment? As of press time (or clicking publish on WordPress time) the site says that 475 people have predicted an average closing share price of $54, which values the company at more than $135 billion. Thats a 42 percent boost over the $38 share price of its IPO  not too shabby. Anyway, if youre so inclined go on over and place a bet of your own. At this point theres no fighting the Facebook IPO fever  and if you cant beat em, join em.
