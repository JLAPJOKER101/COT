A dense cloud of ash from an Icelandic volcano blew toward Scotland on Monday, creating fears among airlines across Europe that the eruption-related travel disruptions of last year would be repeated. British Airways suspended all its flights between London and Scotland for Tuesday morning, and the Dutch carrier KLM canceled more than a dozen flights to and from Scotland and northern England. Still, officials said they did not expect the problems caused by the Grimsvotn volcano to be as great as those caused by another Icelandic volcano last year that led to the grounding of almost all air traffic in Europe.
