Question: How do you acquire your biggest rival if you dont have the cash? Answer: Partner with a private equity firm. SurveyMonkey has done just that, buying MarketTools products Zoomerang, ZoomPanel, and TrueSample through a partnership with TPG Capital.The deal gives MarketTools other businesses and a minority stake in SurveyMonkey to TPG, while SurveyMonkey gets the 3 products and their 1.7 million survey users, 2.5 million panel respondents, and technology to weed out false responses.
