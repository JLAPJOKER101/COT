JOHANNESBURG (AP) &mdash; Kader Asmal, a prominent member of South Africa&rsquo;s governing African National Congress who pressed his party to keep its democratic promises, died on Wednesday. He was 76.        

The party said in a statement that Mr. Asmal died in a Cape Town hospital. No cause of death was given.        

Mr. Asmal led anti-apartheid protests as a high school student in rural eastern South Africa. He later left for Britain and Ireland, where he continued his activism and studied and taught law.        

He returned to South Africa in 1990 and participated in negotiations that ended apartheid. After South Africa&rsquo;s first integrated elections in 1994 brought Nelson Mandela to power, Mr. Asmal served in his cabinet.        

Kader Asmal was born on Oct. 8, 1934. He is survived by his wife, Louise; two sons; and two grandchildren.        

Mr. Asmal was publicly rebuked by the A.N.C. after raising concerns about party stances that he feared threatened democracy. But on Wednesday, the party praised his &ldquo;immeasurable contribution in the liberation of South Africa,&rdquo; and called him one of the anti-apartheid movement&rsquo;s &ldquo;foremost intellectual giants.&rdquo;        

This month, Mr. Asmal spoke out against what he called an &ldquo;appalling&rdquo; A.N.C. bill under which reporters could be jailed for publishing information that officials wanted kept secret. So far the measure has stalled in Parliament, which is overwhelmingly controlled by the A.N.C.
