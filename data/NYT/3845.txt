Security forces opened fire on protesters calling for the ouster of President Ali Abdullah Saleh during a march in the capital on Monday, killing one and injuring eight, a medical official said. Security forces also lobbed tear gas at the protesters. In a separate protest, about 100 journalists marched outside the residence of Vice President Abed Rabbo Mansour, the acting head of state while Mr. Saleh is recovering from injuries in Saudi Arabia, to protest harassment and censorship by the authorities.
