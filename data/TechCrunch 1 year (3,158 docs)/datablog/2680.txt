Until recently Vienna hasnt generally been known in Europe as a startup hub, but this week has blown that perception out of the water. What appears to be going on is the clear emergence of Vienna as kind of bridge between Eastern and Central Europe on the one hand and the gravitational pull of London and Berlins startup ecosystems in Western Europe. The evidence was clear this week, as over 500 people and 50 startups packed into an 18th century ballroom for five days in the combined conference and startup competition billed as Startup Week Europe. There are plenty of pretenders to that nom du clure, but Vienna has proved an awesome hub for the region and the event is sure to take its place in the panoply of European tech conferences now emerging  and appropriately, a minutes silence was held today in honour of Steve Jobs. The eventual winner of the startups competition was Mysugr, a startup which appears to have captured the zeitgeist of mobile, health and social gaming.
