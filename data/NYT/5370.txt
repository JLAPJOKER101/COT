Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi said Thursday that his government was the only &ldquo;credible alternative&rdquo; capable of leading Italy through the economic crisis. His government faces a confidence vote in Parliament on Friday. If he loses it, he will be forced to step down. On Tuesday, the government unexpectedly failed to pass routine legislation, prompting the call for the confidence vote.
