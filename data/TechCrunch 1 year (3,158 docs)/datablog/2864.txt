Today, in the buildup to its f8 conference, Facebook is rolling out another key new feature: a one-way follow model called Subscriptions. Its sort of like Twitter, sort of like Google+, and
it massages one of the services biggest pain points for users who have a lot of friends (or who want to share their status updates broadly).Heres how it works. As you browse around the site, youll notice that some users have a button at the top of their profile that says Subscribe. Click it, and youll start seeing that users status updates in your News Feed, just as if you were their Facebook friend. But theres a big difference: unlike normal Facebook friends, the people you subscribe to dont have to approve your subscription request, and theres no limit on how many people can subscribe to any given user.Facebook says the feature will appeal to anyone looking to reach a broader audience, like journalists, artists, and political figures. To start sharing your own posts publicly, head to the new tab beneath your profile photo that says Subscriptions. Click it, and youll have the option to broadcast your public updates to anyone who has subscribed to you. Note that youll only syndicate updates that are marked Public; updates shared with Friend Lists wont be seen by your subscribers.Of course, Facebook has offered a similar feature called Pages for years now, which was meant for nearly the same thing (youll find that many journalists and politicians have already created Facebook Pages because thats what Facebook told them to do). The difference here, Facebook says, is that users no longer have to maintain two separate entities; they can just use the sites sharing settings to decide which content they want to share very broadly, and what will only be shared with friends.Facebook adds that this isnt the end of Pages by any means — they say that feature will still appeal to brands and major celebrities, because Pages can be managed by multiple admins and can be customized with applications. Pages also offer Insights (Facebooks analytics tool), whereas Subscriptions dont.Fortunately, Facebook is allowing users to merge their Pages with their profiles, so you dont have to rebuild your audience if you want to use the Subscription feature.In addition to Subscriptions, Facebook is also making it easier to tweak the amount and types of content that show up your News Feed. Now, when youre viewing a users profile, youll be able to hit a button and choose from three subscription settings:All updates: Everything your friend posts
•
Most updates: The amount you’d normally see
•
Important updates only: Just highlights, like a new job or moveYoull also be able to choose what kinds of content you want to see (for example, you could opt to block all game-related updates from one of your friends, but keep their photo updates).Once again, this is a feature that shares similarities with the recently-launched Google+. Google+ employs a one-way friending system, where anyone can start following anyone else, without requiring their approval. And, obviously, Twitter popularized one-way following in the first place. The big difference here from Twitter is that Facebooks News Feed algorithms still apply, so you wont be seeing every update from every user youve subscribed to (unless you manually adjust the aforementioned settings to do so).Update: Along With Subscriptions, You’ll Soon Be Able To Update Twitter From Facebook
