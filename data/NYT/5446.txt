The police conducted hundreds of raids across the country on Monday against people Deputy Interior Minister Alfredo Mantovano described as far-left anarchists. The police were searching for suspects in the riot that caused millions of dollars of damage and injured 135 people in downtown Rome during a demonstration over the weekend. The police made no arrests, however, beyond the 12 people arrested Saturday.
