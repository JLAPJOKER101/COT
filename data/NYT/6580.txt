LONDON (Reuters) &mdash; The British government has reached a tentative accord on overhauling pensions with most public-sector unions, the chief secretary to the Treasury, Danny Alexander, said on Tuesday, easing fears of additional strikes after a large walkout over the issue last month.        

Union executives and members will study the deal, part of the government&rsquo;s efforts to reduce the deficit. The government says it needs to reduce the cost of pensions for public workers, which it says are unaffordable. The unions are expected to respond early next year.        

Mr. Alexander said that 26 of 28 unions had reached an agreement in principle. But it was unclear on Tuesday evening that so many unions had signed up. The Public and Commercial Services Union, which represents civil servants, rejected the accord.        

Mr. Alexander appeared to close the door on additional major amendments to the deal. &ldquo;This is the government&rsquo;s final position,&rdquo; he said.        

The Public and Commercial Services Union, which says it is Britain&rsquo;s fifth-largest union, said that singling it out for rejecting the government&rsquo;s proposals was &ldquo;unacceptable bullying&rdquo; and that it was not right for the government to force public-sector workers to pay for economic difficulties they did not cause.        

Many public-sector workers blame the financial services industry for an ailing economy. Unions say the pension changes will force people to work longer before retiring and to pay more for pensions that will be worth less.
