As youve likely heard by now, today is Nigel Tufnel day. Tufnel, who revolutionized the music world in the early-80s with the introduction of volume knobs that go to 11 (rather than a mere 10), is being honored worldwide because of todays date: 11/11/11.Its a nice gesture, but Tufnels current employer, Google, apparently isnt giving him the day off: he just sent me an email invite to a special event thats being held next week in Los Angeles. Thankfully Googles at least let him inject some personality into the invite: the top of the invite fittingly says These Go To Eleven at the top, though it gives little indication as to what to expect.The event will be held November 16,and will be livestreamed at YouTube.com/Android — which, presumably, means that its going to be Android related.My hunch? I think were going to see some of the fruits of Googles @Home project, which was announced at Google I/O this year. @Home is the Android platform for connecting real-world devices, like speakers, lights, and all sorts of other things up with Android — sort of like Apples AirPlay, but for all kinds of applications beyond audio and video. Or, as the comments point out, it probably would make more sense for this to be related to Google Music, which is rumored to be getting new features over the current version, including the ability to actually buy songs. I still want my Android speakers, though.Heres a video embed of a documentary covering Tufnel and his band, Spinal Tap, in which he explains the origins of his 11-digit knobs:
