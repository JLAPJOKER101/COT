Black-clad attackers hacked nine people to death in the village of Tsohon Foron in central Nigeria on Friday, witnesses said, in what appeared to be the latest in a string of revenge killings in Plateau State. The witnesses said gunmen raided the village overnight, shooting in the air before descending on their victims with machetes. Plateau State has been caught up in violence between gangs of Christian and Muslim youths since the end of last month, when a group attacked and killed several Muslims as they gathered for prayers at the end of Ramadan. Seventy people have been killed there since early August, United Nations officials said.
