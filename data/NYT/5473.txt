A former Afghan lawmaker ended a hunger strike of more than two weeks over her removal from office after an appeal from one of the country&rsquo;s most revered elders to call off her protest. Semin Barakzai, the former lawmaker, had vowed to abstain from food and drink until the government investigated vote fraud allegations stemming from the parliamentary elections that took place more than a year ago. Her strike was one in a string of protests, accusations and investigations that have delayed parliament&rsquo;s work and threatened to undermine the legislature&rsquo;s legitimacy.        

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;On Wednesday, Ms. Barakzai had three spoonfuls of soup, fed to her by Subghatullah Mujaddedi, who briefly served as Afghanistan&rsquo;s president in 1992. Afghan election officials have said they will stand by their decision to remove Ms. Barakzai and eight other lawmakers from office after a review of election results. But a committee appointed by the president is continuing the investigation, and Mr. Mujaddedi vowed to follow up on its work.
