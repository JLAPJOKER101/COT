Four members of a Colombian family have been indicted on charges of trying to export 22 F-5 fighter jet engines to Iran in a sting operation by United States federal agents, American officials said Wednesday in an indictment in Miami. Felipe Echeverry and three of his relatives are accused of conspiring to sell the aircraft engines for $320,000 to an undercover agent. The Colombians agreed to help the agent export the engines from Miami to Iran through Panama, according to the indictment and a previously filed complaint. The documents released by the United States Attorney&rsquo;s Office in the Southern District of Florida said Mr. Echeverry posted an Internet advertisement offering the fighter jet engines for sale.
