A supreme court judge on Friday dismissed three arrest warrants for former President Manuel Zelaya of Honduras, which would allow him to return without detention to the country where he was deposed in a June 2009 coup. The ruling by Justice Oscar Chinchilla did not dismiss corruption charges that were levied against Mr. Zelaya, who was whisked to Costa Rica in his pajamas by the military in June after he ignored court orders to drop a referendum on changing the Constitution. Mr. Zelaya has called the charges political.
