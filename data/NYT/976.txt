Ivorian troops killed at least six protesters calling on Laurent Gbagbo to step down as leader on Monday, witnesses said. Residents reported gunfire all morning in Abidjan, the commercial capital, as soldiers and paramilitaries broke up demonstrations. Mr. Gbagbo lost the presidential election in November but has refused to leave office. A panel of African presidents arrived in Abidjan on Monday hoping to persuade him to step down in return for guarantees. Mr. Gbagbo has previously rejected similar proposals.
