An Italian parliamentary commission passed a draft law on Tuesday to ban women from wearing clothing that covers their faces in public. The draft would prohibit women from wearing any garment, including the burqa and niqab, that covers the face and makes it hard to recognize them in public. Under the proposed legislation, anyone forcing women to cover their faces would be fined and face up to 12 months in jail.
