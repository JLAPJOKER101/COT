About 400 members of an Iranian exile group agreed Wednesday to leave a camp in eastern Iraq, another step in international efforts to end a tense, sometimes violent, impasse between Iraq&rsquo;s government and the 3,400 people inside Camp Ashraf. The plan would move the residents to a former American military base in Baghdad, where they would ultimately relocate outside Iraq. The camp is populated by members of the Mujahedeen Khalq, or People&rsquo;s Mujahedeen, a group that has fought in years past to bring down the Iranian government. The Iraqi government wants to close the camp. On Wednesday night, three rockets struck the camp, but there were no immediate reports of casualties, Iraqi security officials said.
