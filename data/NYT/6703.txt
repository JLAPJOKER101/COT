A court in Addis Ababa sentenced two Swedish journalists on Tuesday to 11 years in prison each for helping an outlawed rebel group and entering the country illegally. The two journalists &mdash; Martin Schibbye, a reporter, and Johan Persson, a photographer &mdash; were arrested in July after they entered Ogaden Province in Ethiopia from Somalia&rsquo;s semiautonomous Puntland region with fighters from the group, the Ogaden National Liberation Front. &ldquo;We believe this is an appropriate sentence,&rdquo; Judge Shemsu Sirgaga said. Frank Belfrage, Sweden&rsquo;s state secretary for foreign affairs, said his country would continue efforts to free the two men by contacting Ethiopian ministers and consulting with the United States and the European Union. The journalists, who have said they were in the region to investigate the activities of an oil explorer that in 2009 bought licenses in Ethiopia from a Swedish company, Lundin Petroleum, were found guilty last week.
