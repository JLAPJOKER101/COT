A senior nuclear adviser to Prime Minister Naoto Kan resigned Friday, saying the government had ignored his advice and failed to follow the law. The adviser, Toshiso Kosako, a Tokyo University professor who was appointed to the post last month, said the government had taken only ad hoc measures to contain the crisis at the crippled Fukushima nuclear plant. In a tearful news conference, he said the government had used &ldquo;flexible approaches&rdquo; to laws and regulations, and only &ldquo;stopgap measures&rdquo; that were &ldquo;delaying the end&rdquo; of the nuclear crisis.
