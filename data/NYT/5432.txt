TRIPOLI, Libya (AP) &mdash; Libyan militias bulldozed the green walls surrounding the main Tripoli compound of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi on Sunday, saying it was time &ldquo;to tear down this symbol of tyranny.&rdquo;        

Ahmad Ghargory, commander of an anti-Qaddafi brigade, said the area would be turned into a public park.        

The capture of the sprawling, fortresslike compound known as Bab al-Aziziya was seen as a turning point when rebels overran the capital in late August.        

Already, the courtyard in front of Colonel Qaddafi&rsquo;s former house, which he used for many fiery speeches during the uprising, has been turned into a weekly pet market. Tripoli residents roam the area as if at a museum, with vendors selling revolutionary flags and other souvenirs. In Surt, the last loyalist holdout, residents complained Sunday of looting by the former rebels, who have cornered the pro-Qaddafi forces in a single district. Pickup trucks were seen leaving the city loaded with rugs, freezers, furniture and other goods, apparently taken by civilians and fighters.
