LAHORE, Pakistan &mdash; A teenage boy blew himself up on Tuesday evening while trying to break through heavy security for a Shiite procession here, killing at least 10 people and wounding 79, the police said.        

A second bomber struck a similar procession in the southern port city of Karachi shortly afterward, killing at least two more people, The Associated Press reported. The Shiites were marking the end of a 40-day mourning period for the martyred Imam Hussein, grandson of the Prophet Muhammad.        

In Lahore, the attacker was 14 to 16 years old, the police said, and was carrying a handbag that he said held CDs. When he tried to enter the procession and was about to be searched, he detonated his explosives, said Rao Sardar, the operational chief of the Lahore police.        

A branch of the Pakistani Taliban, the Qari Hussain Mehsud group, claimed responsibility, according to Geo, a Pakistani television channel.        

The procession was to end near the tomb of a revered figure, where a number of suicide bomb attacks had occurred in the last year.        

One man, Hashmat Khan, said he had been standing outside his house with family members, watching the procession, when the blast occurred.        

&ldquo;We ran towards the spot and saw dead bodies lying on the road,&rdquo; he said. With no immediate help from emergency workers, he said, they took many of the injured and dead by rickshaw to a nearby hospital.        

In Karachi, The A.P. reported, the suicide bomber was riding a motorcycle and carrying his explosives in a bag, said a senior police official, Shaukat Shah. The bomber detonated them near a police van protecting the Shiite marchers, the news agency quoted a witness, Akbar Jaffry, as saying.
