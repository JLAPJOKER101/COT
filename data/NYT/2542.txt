Egypt&rsquo;s prosecutor general, Abdel-Maguid Mahmoud, ordered that the detention of ousted President Hosni Mubarak be extended for another 15 days pending investigation of accusations of illegally amassing wealth and of his role in the use of live ammunition against pro-democracy protesters. Investigators questioned Mr. Mubarak, 83, above, on Tuesday at the hospital where he is being treated in the Red Sea resort of Sharm el Sheik. Also on Tuesday, an Egyptian court convicted the country&rsquo;s former tourism minister of corruption and sentenced him to five years in prison, making him the second high-ranking official to be found guilty since Mr. Mubarak was chased from office. The minister, Zuheir Garana, was found guilty of intentionally damaging public finances by allowing two businessmen to illegally acquire state land.
