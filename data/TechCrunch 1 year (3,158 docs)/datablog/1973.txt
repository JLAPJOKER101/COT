When GoDaddy publicly recanted their support of SOPA last week, many were quick to point out that such an act didnt really mean much. As far as the Judiciary Committee overseeing SOPA was concerned, GoDaddy was still a supporter.Thats been changed, it seems. In the latest version of the US House Of Representatives SOPA Supporters list (heads up: its a PDF), GoDaddys name is nowhere to be found.Does this mean that everyone should immediately resume throwing money at GoDaddy? Of course not; if youre genuinely interested in only handing your greenbacks over to companies that are either neutral towards or against SOPA, its important to keep an eye on the companys actions in the coming weeks (once the scalding hot and blindingly bright spotlight has moved on.) Plus, its not as if there arent plenty of alternatives just begging for your business.Whats more important, however, are the the names still on the list. ESPN? Scholastic, Inc.? Visa? Even if you cant find a way to stop supporting most of the SOPA-friendly companies with your wallet (GoDaddy was quite easy in this sense, which is presumably a big part of why the Internets rallying against them moved so quickly), its important information to keep in the back of your mind.
