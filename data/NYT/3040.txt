MOSCOW &mdash; A Russian-controlled economic assistance fund agreed on Saturday to extend a $3 billion loan to Belarus, propping up the country&rsquo;s teetering economy &mdash; and with it the authoritarian president, Aleksandr G. Lukashenko.        

A devaluation of the Belarusian ruble this spring that spawned lines for staple goods like oil and sugar had cut deeply into Mr. Lukashenko&rsquo;s popularity, already eroded by a crackdown on the opposition leaders.        

Belarus turned to Russia for aid, but it was slow in coming. Russian officials demanded a commitment to privatize much of Belarus&rsquo;s large state-owned industrial sector by selling factories to Russian companies.        

The Russian loan came through at a previously scheduled meeting of the Eurasian Economic Community&rsquo;s emergency fund.        

The $3 billion will be disbursed over three years, Dmitri S. Peskov, the spokesman for Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, told news agencies.
