Moses Mzila Ndlovu, co-minister of national healing and a leader of a faction of the Movement for Democratic Change, was released on $500 bail on Wednesday after five nights in jail. He was charged with attending a meeting that was held without police approval, a prayer service to commemorate the thousands of civilians killed by the North Korean-trained Fifth Brigade in the 1980s. His arrest has worsened relations in the power-sharing government that includes the M.D.C. parties and President Robert Mugabe&rsquo;s ZANU-PF party. Since the M.D.C., the party founded to fight Mr. Mugabe&rsquo;s rule, accepted the power-sharing arrangement in 2008, about 30 of its 109 members of Parliament have been arrested at one point or another, according to human rights lawyers and the M.D.C.
