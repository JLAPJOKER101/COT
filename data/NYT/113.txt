KUFA, Iraq &mdash; From the far reaches of Iraq, they trekked to Friday Prayer in cars, taxis and rickety vans festooned with portraits of a populist cleric whose self-imposed exile ended this week. Many were fervent, some simply curious. And by morning, they had made their way to the hallowed ground of Kufa Mosque, where sun lit the gold domes like a quarter moon.        

There, under a cloudless sky and before the prayers began, they waited.        

&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll come, he&rsquo;ll come,&rdquo; one promised his young friends.        

Another grasped for words to describe his anticipation.        

&ldquo;A hunger,&rdquo; he offered.        

Thousands of worshipers authored a grand drama of faith and longing on the smallest of stages this day, its telling seeming to capture nearly eight years of politics in Iraq &mdash; all those hopes, frustrations and tragedies &mdash; that the United States never quite grasped when it invaded and perhaps still does not as it leaves this year.        

The worshipers here venerated Moktada al-Sadr, home again after more than three years in Iran and at the head of a movement whose seats in Parliament helped empower the prime minister. But Mr. Sadr is merely a man, and their narrative intimated far more.        

&ldquo;This is not a normal day!&rdquo; shouted a guard at a checkpoint near the forbidding brick walls of the mosque, one of the oldest in Islam, where Mr. Sadr&rsquo;s father built a sprawling grass-roots movement before he was killed on Saddam Hussein&rsquo;s orders in 1999. &ldquo;This day is exceptional.&rdquo;        

Clerics strode through the iron gates with the arrogance of education. Vendors hawked green scarves for a dollar, portraits of Mr. Sadr for half that. Worshipers hung their sandals on the stubs of palm trees&rsquo; trunks, then, in black to mark a somber month in the Shiite calendar, made their way across the dusty and worn asphalt, vainly swept.        

&ldquo;I came for one reason &mdash; to meet his excellency, Moktada,&rdquo; said Hussein Kadhim Hassan, who arrived on a bus that left Baghdad at dawn. &ldquo;I hope. All I can do is hope.&rdquo;        

Beyond the mosque, in neighboring Najaf, Mr. Sadr is often reviled. His militia&rsquo;s battles with the American military in 2004 wrecked the sacred city, and his prominence during the occupation threatened to upset Najaf&rsquo;s established order, whose clerics revere the antithesis of Mr. Sadr, namely age and scholarship. Its merchants, for whom piety means profit, still deem him little more than a dim rabble-rouser with ill-mannered followers. Some worry that he heralds a return to strife that could interrupt the city&rsquo;s feverish building &mdash; including overpasses, sewage systems, and vast complexes rising along boulevards.        

But for the worshipers leaving the courtyard and passing through the mosque&rsquo;s portico of yellow, blue and turquoise tile, adorned in Arabic script rendered as precisely as its geometric design, he represents something different. Rarely is the story about Mr. Sadr, or at least Mr. Sadr as a figure in isolation, like the self-made man of American myth. More often it is about his family and what it incarnates of Iraq, a country the devout call a land of prophets. As the posters declare, he is the cub of his leonine father, the flower of the Sadr family. To the fervent, he is imbued with the courage of Imam Ali, the most revered Shiite saint, and the martyrdom of the imam&rsquo;s most beloved son, Hussein.        

&ldquo;Worthy of our sacrifice,&rdquo; one of the posters reads.        

Rumors punctuated the hours. Pandemonium erupted at one entrance, as shouts of his imminent arrival sent worshipers surging through towering wooden doors. &ldquo;Long live Moktada!&rdquo; the men yelled before guards slammed the doors shut, trying to quiet the crowd.        

Inside the mosque, where worshipers knelt on prayer rugs, scarves, winter jackets or nothing, some stared at the pulpit, hoping for a glimpse. An old man passed them, collecting alms. &ldquo;Give for an operation for a sick man,&rdquo; he pleaded, and they did. The cold white marble tamed a harsh sun, which bathed expectant others, who soon spilled past the entrances on to the staircases outside. They, too, strained for a view.        

Just before the prayers began, a murmur rippled across the courtyard that his silver BMW had pulled up behind the mosque. His arrival, they said, was imminent.

&ldquo;I&rsquo;m expecting him,&rdquo; said Abu Mustafa Mohammed, a 40-year-old veteran of Mr. Sadr&rsquo;s militia, blamed for some of the worst sectarian carnage in Iraq&rsquo;s civil war. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t hear anything,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s only my expectation. Well, my hope, at least.&rdquo;        

Another worshiper, Ahlam Nouri shouted, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s on his way! He&rsquo;s on his way!&rdquo; Ms. Nouri, 48, pulled her black veil toward her face in a gesture of decorum. &ldquo;Our hearts tell us so.&rdquo;        

Ms. Nouri came with her sister and two nephews, one named for Mr. Sadr. She made her pilgrimage out of respect: Mr. Sadr&rsquo;s followers bought her a refrigerator and paid her sister $2,200 for rent after her husband was kidnapped and presumably killed.        

&ldquo;Only this man is Iraqi, only he loves the country,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He survives on the dates of Iraq. The government doesn&rsquo;t want him because he stands against them, for us.&rdquo;        

She took her seat, and at 12:13 p.m., the sermon began.        

In a sign of the times, the Americans come up far less than they once did. Posters still demand their departure, and one worshiper warned that if they did not leave by 2012, &ldquo;all the events that happened will happen again.&rdquo; But in Sheik Asad al-Naseri&rsquo;s speech, they were mentioned only cryptically. It is an Iraqi moment, and the movement, striving for the discipline and influence of another Arab Shiite movement, Lebanon&rsquo;s Hezbollah, warned troublemakers in the group not to smear the Sadrists&rsquo; &ldquo;clean reputation.&rdquo;        

&ldquo;Some wrongdoings were one of the reasons that drove your leader away from you all this time,&rdquo; he told the worshipers. &ldquo;Do not allow this to happen again.&rdquo;        

After all, he said, Mr. Sadr is &ldquo;a blessing of God.&rdquo;        

Fifty-six minutes later, the sermon ended, and Mr. Sadr had yet to appear.        

The silence of the prayers broke to the bass drums of lamentations blaring from sidewalk speakers. The winter breeze picked up, and worshipers dusted off their pants and fumbled for their shoes. Ms. Nouri passed them, shaking her head in disappointment. &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t he come?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Why couldn&rsquo;t we just have a glimpse of his eyes?&rdquo;        

She shrugged before joining the legions of others walking into sun-soaked streets, bound for distant towns of an undecided country, where they awaited their reckoning.
