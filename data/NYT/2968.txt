The Black Sea region of Abkhazia, which considers itself independent but is claimed by Georgia and viewed as Georgian territory by most of the international community, won recognition Tuesday from a second South Pacific island, the Republic of Vanuatu. Earlier, Abkhazia was recognized by Nauru, which is the world&rsquo;s smallest country and like Vanuatu is situated in the Pacific Ocean east of Australia. Abkhazia is also recognized by Russia &mdash; which fought a war with Georgia over it and another breakaway region &mdash; as well as Nicaragua and Venezuela. Tiny South Pacific island states have been a particular prize for Abkhazia, as they have been for decades for new nations seeking to bulk up on the number of countries offering recognition. The government of Vanuatu, which is in an economic slump, said in a statement that recognition was intended to &ldquo;foster the development of friendly relations&rdquo; and explore joint economic projects.
