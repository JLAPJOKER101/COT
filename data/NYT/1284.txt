PARIS &mdash; Former President Jacques Chirac won at least a temporary reprieve on Tuesday from his trial on corruption charges, which was delayed after a judge ruled that the case presented serious constitutional issues.        

The case is being sent to the country&rsquo;s highest court, which will determine if the case can move forward.        

Mr. Chirac, 78 and retired, was absent from the courtroom when the judge, Dominique Pauthe, issued his ruling, setting a new trial date of June 20. Mr. Chirac is accused of creating 28 &ldquo;ghost&rdquo; jobs for political allies from 1977 to 1995 while he was the mayor of Paris. The jobs allegedly required no work, but those holding them were paid salaries.        

A defense lawyer for one of nine other defendants in the case successfully argued that the charges &mdash; based on two separate investigations in suburban Nanterre and Paris &mdash; raise constitutional issues because the statute of limitations had run out on the Paris case.
