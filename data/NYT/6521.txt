ANKARA, Turkey &mdash; Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta on Friday called for Turkey to rebuild ties with Israel in the interest of security, echoing a call he issued this month for the government of Israel to reach out to other nations across the Middle East.        

&ldquo;In this time of sweeping change in the region, it&rsquo;s important for Turkey to have strong relationships with those who share an interest in regional security and stability, including Israel,&rdquo; Mr. Panetta said. &ldquo;I believe that it is in Turkey&rsquo;s interest and in Israel&rsquo;s interest for the two to move forward.&rdquo;        

Turkey has increasingly become a leader of regional outrage over Israel&rsquo;s treatment of Palestinians since last year, when Ankara froze ties with Israel over a commando raid on a vessel that was sailing from Turkey and trying to reach Gaza.        

Turkey also has shown an emboldened foreign policy in leading regional capitals to impose tough sanctions on Syria to punish the government of President Bashar al-Assad for his violent crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators. Those moves dovetail with Western efforts to isolate Mr. Assad after months of trying to get him to reach a peaceful solution to the uprising.        

Mr. Panetta and Turkish leaders discussed the importance of continuing pressure on the Syrian government, &ldquo;so that Assad steps down and the people of Syria are given the opportunity to be able to establish the institutions of government that will give them greater rights and opportunities.&rdquo;        

Noting that other autocratic leaders in the region have been forced from power since the beginning of the so-called Arab Spring, Mr. Panetta said, &ldquo;And I believe at some point it&rsquo;s going to happen in Syria, as well.&rdquo;
