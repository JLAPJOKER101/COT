Citing poor sales of the Nintendo 3DS and the stronger yen against the euro was also another reason, Nintendo posted its first-ever loss  $534.6 million on revenue of $8 billion. This is down from $12.6 billion in revenue last year with $960 million in profit.But, as they say, its dangerous to invest alone. Here, take this: the company is predicting a profit of $429 million next year.Nintendo bet big on the 3DS and the forthcoming Wii U, a superior console designed for clever multi-player gaming. Although the Wii is the best-selling console in the world, its clear that demand has slowed with the launch of Kinect from Microsoft and the PlayStation Move.Were expecting to hear much more about the Wii U launch this summer at E3 and, provided they can get a product out the door by the holiday, expect these numbers to rise skyward. Its a little sad to see Mario stumble like this, but heres hoping he regroups.
