For a company that generally sticks to fancy-pants Bluetooth headsets and speakers, Jawbone has done a surprisingly good job of making their UP fitness-wristband-thing into a rather trendy item. Alas, theres another trend going around thats not nearly as beneficial: complaining that the UP is broken.Looking to fix things before the UPs reputation goes down for the count, Jawbone CEO Hosain Rahman has just announced that the company is implementing a full No-Questions-Asked refund policy for anyone with a wonky wristband. They dont even want it back.In a letter to UP owners, Rahman says We recognize that this product has not yet lived up to everyone’s expectations – including our own – so we’re taking action.Users looking to take part in the program are offered two options: cash, or Jawbone.com credit. If you take the former, theyll give you $109.43 (if youre in the US — it varies a bit based on currency/location); if you go for the credit, theyll bump it up to $150. Perhaps most (pleasantly) surprising, Jawbone isnt making anyone actually send their wristbands back; as long as you promise that you havent returned your UP already and that you wont sell it on eBay or otherwise profit from the device, theyll cough up the dough. The program kicks off tomorrow, with a placeholder page already up here.Furthermore, the FAQ page reveals that Jawbone has cancelled all pending UP orders (it seems to be pulled from Amazon already, as well) and pledges to not begin taking orders again until they have sorted out the issues with [the] UP bands.This is perhaps the toughest move the company could make — but given the circumstances, almost certainly the best move as well. It wont be easy, it wont be cheap, and Jawbone will undoubtedly pay out a ton of cash to people with fully functional devices — but in the end, the company walks away with their reputation and the opportunity to relaunch the device once the kinks are worked out.
