RIO DE JANEIRO &mdash; Brazil&rsquo;s president has committed the government to building 6,000 homes for displaced residents of the hillside communities devastated by landslides that killed at least 842 people this month.        

President Dilma Rousseff took office just days after heavy rains flooded the towns of Petr&oacute;polis, Teres&oacute;polis and Nova Friburgo, creating the worst natural disaster in Brazil&rsquo;s history.        

On Thursday, Ms. Rousseff said the federal government would join with the state of Rio and private companies to help relocate homeless residents. Gov. Sergio Cabral of Rio said the state would build 2,000 homes, bringing the total to 8,000.        

&ldquo;Through this initiative we hope to lessen the pain for these families,&rdquo; Ms. Rousseff said.        

The severe flooding left 8,777 people homeless, and nearly 21,000 additional people abandoned their homes, state officials said. For the time being, many are still living in shelters set up in gymnasiums, churches and schools. Donations have poured in, including 44 tons of food.        

Beyond the new housing, Ms. Rousseff said the government would map areas at high risk of disasters. The federal government said last week that it was giving about $59.7 million to the towns affected by the deadly flooding.        

Construction is scheduled to begin in the next few weeks, with the federal government being responsible for construction and the state government for infrastructure like sanitation.        

Disaster experts have cited Brazil&rsquo;s lack of disaster preparedness in the tragedy and criticized local officials for allowing people to construct dwellings in areas prone to flooding.        

State officials said the houses would be constructed on donated land but did not specify where.
