The United Nations-backed tribunal investigating the killing of a former Lebanese prime minister said Thursday that it had received the long-overdue half of its budget from Beirut, about $32 million. Many in Lebanon&rsquo;s government, dominated by the militant group Hezbollah, had opposed cooperating with the court. The court has indicted four Hezbollah members as suspects in the 2005 killing of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri. Hezbollah&rsquo;s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, said Thursday that although he disagreed with the payment, his party and its allies would not stop it. &ldquo;We reject the legality and constitutionality of financing the court or cooperating with it in any way, but we will not cause a problem in the country, and we will serve the higher national interest,&rdquo; he said in a televised address. He has promised, however, that the government will never arrest the indicted Hezbollah members. The court is debating whether to try them in absentia.
