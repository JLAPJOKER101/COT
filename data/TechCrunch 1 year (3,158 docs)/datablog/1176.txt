Klip, a mobile app that allows users to capture, share, discover and view videos, is debuting a new version of its iOS app that allows users to shoot videos with visual effects and filters in real-time. The company has also added seven new video effects to the app.Klip, which launched in September, is focused on mobile video discovery and providing the highest quality video streaming around for iOS. You simply shoot a new Klip or grab one from your Camera Roll and share it with theÂ community, your friends on Facebook, Twitter, on your YouTube channel, or by email. Within the app, you can watch Klips from around the world, follow other Klippers, re-klip the Klips you think are worth sharing again, or stay on top of hot topics by following hashtags.As Klip explains to me, shooting a mobile video with the effects on in real-time (as opposed to adding the effects afterwards) is a complex computer science challenge. The new effects added to the app include, Zenith (a retro tube TV effect in both color and black & white), a cartoon-like effect (Toon), Gotham, Cinema (an old time movie effect), HDR, Fisheye (mirror effect) and Voodoo. Klip is particularly proud of this effect, which highlights one color (green or red) and displays all other colors as black and white.Klip has been steadily updating its app since launch last year, most recently adding suggested recommendations, and SMS functionality. And the startup just raised $8 million in Series B funding from Benchmark Capital, Matrix Partners and Alain Rossmann (the founder of the company).
