SANA, Yemen &mdash; Yemen&rsquo;s president fired his cabinet on Sunday, while antigovernment demonstrations here in the capital grew in number and momentum two days after government-linked forces opened fire on protesters, killing at least 45 people and wounding more than 200.        



&ldquo;A new cabinet will be formed in the near future,&rdquo; a government official said by phone, although he requested anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly.        

When asked about the timing of the dismissals by President Ali Abdullah Saleh, the official replied: &ldquo;This government was supposed to change a while ago; it passed its deadline. This isn&rsquo;t a big surprise.&rdquo;        

While the implications of his announcement were unclear, Mr. Saleh, who has ruled this country for 33 years, has come under increased pressure from the United States and from officials in his own government over his handling of the protests.        

In a sign of the Obama administration&rsquo;s growing alarm at the government&rsquo;s response, President Obama&rsquo;s top counterterrorism adviser, John O. Brennan, telephoned Mr. Saleh on Sunday to express the White House&rsquo;s deep concern.        

An administration official said Mr. Brennan told Mr. Saleh that &ldquo;any Yemeni government, no matter what its composition, must refrain from violence against protesters and support the right of the people of Yemen to engage in peaceful assembly.&rdquo;        

&ldquo;Any government must also support political change that meets the aspirations of the Yemeni people,&rdquo; the official said.        

The official, who was not authorized to speak for attribution, praised Mr. Saleh for ordering an investigation into the violence on Friday, and urged him &ldquo;to follow through on that effort, and to ensure that anyone who has committed acts of violence is held accountable.&rdquo;        

Still, another, more senior administration official said that Friday&rsquo;s violence &ldquo;might have ruined any remaining chance of political dialogue between the Saleh government and the opposition.&rdquo;        

Nine Yemeni ambassadors to European and Arab countries sent a letter to Mr. Saleh on Sunday condemning &ldquo;the massacre&rdquo; on Friday. That letter followed the resignations by several high-ranking Yemeni officials, including the country&rsquo;s envoy to the United Nations, its ambassador to Lebanon and its human rights minister.        

Despite Friday&rsquo;s violence against the protesters, a round-the-clock sit-in that branched out for more than a mile from Sana University&rsquo;s main gate grew even larger Sunday with newly erected tents hung with photographs of the protesters who had been killed.        

&ldquo;The blood of the martyrs watered the tree of freedom,&rdquo; said Abdullah Hamid, a protester, when asked about the reason behind the increase in the number of demonstrators. A student protest leader, Salah Sharafi, said, &ldquo;They put the seeds of victory in us when they start to kill us.&rdquo;        

Tribes from across Yemen have historically been embroiled in conflicts, but so far few squabbles have taken place among them at the sit-in, their leaders and other protesters said.        

&ldquo;No one expected the tribes would act like this,&rdquo; said Mr. Sharafi, the student leader. &ldquo;They opened their arms&rdquo; without weapons &ldquo;to say that they are civilians, but they have determination for change.&rdquo;        

Abel Aziz al-Masbahy, an unemployed man who arrived Sunday from his home in Dhamar Province just south of Sana, stood in front of a poster with the photographs of two teenage boys and a young man from Dhamar who were killed on Friday. The words &ldquo;Martyrs of the peaceful youth revolution&rdquo; were written above them.        

&ldquo;Saleh lost his legitimacy in&rdquo; our region, Mr. Masbahy said.        

Two men from Khowlan, an area east of Sana known for kidnapping and a heavily armed population, were killed on Friday. One was shot as he sat in a green tent with a neighbor from Khowlan, Obad Dahamash, and about 20 other men. The bullet hole was still visible in the tent&rsquo;s fabric. &ldquo;At first our goal was to kick out Ali Saleh, his family and his gang,&rdquo; Mr. Dahamash said. &ldquo;Now we want to prosecute them.&rdquo;        

Tribal culture in Yemen has a strong tradition of violent retribution; however, members of the group swore they would remain peaceful.        

&ldquo;This revolution united us as tribes, and we are able to take our rights without using weapons, without using guns,&rdquo; Mr. Dahamash said. &ldquo;After this massacre killed people from Khowlan, it united us with other tribes, as all the tribes came and sympathized with us. They know that we don&rsquo;t have our guns here and that we don&rsquo;t want civil war.&rdquo;
