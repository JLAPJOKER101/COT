A landslide caused by heavy rains in La Paz has destroyed more than 400 homes in nine poor neighborhoods and has left more than 100,000 people without running water, the authorities said. There have been no deaths in the slide, which began over the weekend, but thousands have sought refuge in schools and on sports fields, the city said.
