Former Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico said Tuesday that he was leaving Cuba after apparently exhausting all avenues to try to see Alan Gross, an American subcontractor from Maryland who was sentenced to 15 years in prison for crimes against the state. Mr. Richardson had vowed not to leave Cuba without seeing Mr. Gross.
