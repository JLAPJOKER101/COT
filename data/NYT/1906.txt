Thirty-seven former Cuban political prisoners and their relatives will arrive in Madrid on Friday, a Spanish Foreign Ministry official said, the largest group yet to arrive since the two countries agreed to such transfers. With one exception, the prisoners are not part of the group of 75 dissidents being freed under an agreement reached between President Ra&uacute;l Castro of Cuba and Cardinal Jaime Ortega. So far Spain has accepted 40 of those dissidents.
