WASHINGTON &mdash; The Obama administration has expanded its role in Mexico&rsquo;s fight against organized crime by allowing the Mexican police to stage cross-border drug raids from inside the United States, according to senior administration and military officials.        

Mexican commandos have discreetly traveled to the United States, assembled at designated areas and dispatched helicopter missions back across the border aimed at suspected drug traffickers. The Drug Enforcement Administration provides logistical support on the American side of the border, officials said, arranging staging areas and sharing intelligence that helps guide Mexico&rsquo;s decisions about targets and tactics.        

Officials said these so-called boomerang operations were intended to evade the surveillance &mdash; and corrupting influences &mdash; of the criminal organizations that closely monitor the movements of security forces inside Mexico. And they said the efforts were meant to provide settings with tight security for American and Mexican law enforcement officers to collaborate in their pursuit of criminals who operate on both sides of the border.        

Although the operations remain rare, they are part of a broadening American campaign aimed at blunting the power of Mexican cartels that have built criminal networks spanning the world and have started a wave of violence in Mexico that has left more than 35,000 people dead.        

Many aspects of the campaign remain secret, because of legal and political sensitivities. But in recent months, details have begun to emerge, revealing efforts that would have been unthinkable five years ago. Mexico&rsquo;s president, Felipe Calder&oacute;n, who was elected in 2006, has broken with his country&rsquo;s historic suspicion of the United States and has enlisted Washington&rsquo;s help in defeating the cartels, a central priority for his government.        

American Predator and Global Hawk drones now fly deep over Mexico to capture video of drug production facilities and smuggling routes. Manned American aircraft fly over Mexican targets to eavesdrop on cellphone communications. And the D.E.A. has set up an intelligence outpost &mdash; staffed by Central Intelligence Agency operatives and retired American military personnel &mdash; on a Mexican military base.        

&ldquo;There has always been a willingness and desire on the part of the United States to play more of a role in Mexico&rsquo;s efforts,&rdquo; said Eric L. Olson, an expert on Mexico at the Woodrow Wilson Center. &ldquo;But there have been some groundbreaking developments on the Mexican side where we&rsquo;re seeing officials who are willing to take some risks, even political risks, by working closely with the United States to carry out very sensitive missions.&rdquo;        

Still, the cooperation remains a source of political tensions, especially in Mexico where the political classes have been leery of the United States dating from the Mexican-American War of 1846. Recent disclosures about the expanding United States&rsquo; role in the country&rsquo;s main national security efforts have set off a storm of angry assertions that Mr. Calder&oacute;n has put his own political interests ahead of Mexican sovereignty. Mr. Calder&oacute;n&rsquo;s political party faces an election next year that is viewed in part as a referendum on his decision to roll out this campaign against drug traffickers.        

Deputy Secretary of State William J. Burns walked into that storm during a visit to Mexico this month and strongly defended the partnership the two governments had developed.        

&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll simply repeat that there are clear limits to our role,&rdquo; Mr. Burns said. &ldquo;Our role is not to conduct operations. It is not to engage in law enforcement activities. That is the role of the Mexican authorities. And that&rsquo;s the way it should be.&rdquo;        

Officials said Mexico and the United States began discussing the possibility of cross-border missions two years ago, when Mexico&rsquo;s crime wave hit the important industrial corridor between Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo. To avoid being detected, the Mexican police traveled to the United States in plain clothes on commercial flights, two military officials said. Later the officers were transported back to Mexico on Mexican aircraft, which dropped the agents at or near their targets.        

&ldquo;The cartels don&rsquo;t expect Mexican police coming from the U.S.,&rdquo; said one senior military official. None of the officials interviewed about the boomerang operations would speak publicly about them, and refused to provide details about where they were conducted or what criminal organizations had been singled out.        

They said that the operations had been carried out only a couple of times in the last 18 months, and that they had not resulted in any significant arrests.        

The officials insisted that the Pentagon is not involved in the cross-border operations, and that no Americans take part in drug raids on Mexican territory.
