The Dominican Republic has begun its first major crackdown on illegal Haitian immigrants since last January&rsquo;s earthquake, rounding up and deporting hundreds of people in recent days, officials said Thursday. More than 700 Haitians have been deported since Monday, said Ambiorix Rosario, a spokesman for the Department of Migration. Officials said the crackdown was necessary to stem growing illegal immigration and to prevent the spread of cholera, which has killed more than 3,000 people in Haiti since October. About 150 have been sickened in the Dominican Republic.
