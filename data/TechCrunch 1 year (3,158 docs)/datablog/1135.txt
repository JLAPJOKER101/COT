The state of Michigan is changing — a burgeoning startup scene has taken the stage, and what some may call a tech renaissance has swept across the state, namely in Detroit.So it shouldnt be much of a surprise that Twitter, one of the biggest names in tech, is opening an office in downtown Detroit. The office will be based in the M@dison Building, which is owned by Rock Ventures LLC.The office will be a base for Twitter employees working to help marketers and advertising agencies in Detroit take advantage of the multiple promoted products features Twitter offers to brands.Once Twitter has established itself in Detroit, the company expects to hire more employees.Heres what Twitters president of global revenue, Adam Bain had to say about it:Detroit’s emerging mix of automotive and digital cultures made it a natural location for Twitter’s newest office. We’re excited to work face-to-face with the city’s most established brands and happy to play a role in downtown Detroit’s digital renaissance.As I mentioned, Detroit is blossoming with all kinds of wonderful startups including Detroit Labs, Are You a Human, and UpTo. Twitters move there should only pour a little water on the flowers.[Image credit: CBS]
