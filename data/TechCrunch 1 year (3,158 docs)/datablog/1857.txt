You can view our interview with 50 Cent live at CES today at Noon Pacific/3pm Eastern. Why Fiddy and why at CES? Because the musician is now moving into electronics, following Dr. Dre with his Beats line and, in another sense, the ease with which smaller companies (and individuals) can actually build and market interesting hardware.His new headphones, Street And Sync By 50, are characterized by their built-in Kleer wireless technology and wild colors. Update: The live stream is over, but our live team is getting ready to hit the show floor once again! Click here to see what were up to.
