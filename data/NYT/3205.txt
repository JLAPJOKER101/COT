About 500 police officers conducted a series of drug raids at Mohawk communities in the Montreal area on Tuesday and detained about 50 people. The police said they were investigating a drug trafficking ring that dealt primarily in marijuana. Some of the raids were at reserves, which are comparable to reservations in the United States.
