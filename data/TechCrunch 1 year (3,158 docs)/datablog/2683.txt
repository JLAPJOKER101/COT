Well now. Samsungs teaser video hinted at something big making its debut on October 11, but a new leak may have blown the whole thing wide open. BGR claims to have received the full spec sheet for Samsungs long-awaited Galaxy Nexus (nee Nexus Prime), and if true, itâ€™s a sight to behold.Before we go forward, I should caution you to have your grains of salt at the ready. Were about to step into some murky territory.The spec listing confirms a few things we were already expecting to see, like the inclusion of Ice Cream Sandwich and a huge 4.65-inch display. BGRs sources go on to say that the Galaxy Nexus will sport a TI OMAP 4460 processor, which clocks in at 1.2 GHz, and 1 GB of RAM. It also packs a 5MP camera (with support for recording 1080p video), 32 GB of internal storage, an NFC chip, and an LTE or HSPA radio into a body thats only 9mm thick.Unfortunately, the Galaxy Nexus is said to be a Verizon exclusive at least for the time being. With their data caps firmly in place, it may be a good thing that Ice Cream Sandwich is reportedly able to track data use on an app-by-app basis. Its also worth mentioning that the Galaxy Nexus is a pure Google Experience device, so users wont have to deal with carrier or manufacturer tweaks.Skeptic though I may be, these specs seem just average enough to be legit. It doesnt pack a stupid fast processor, nor a crazy camera, nor anything that at first glance seems to good to be true. Even the design may be more sober than first anticipated. An enterprising Redditor named Greyhaven7 (a.k.a. Eric Hedden in real life) took a still from yesterdays teaser video and cleaned it up substantially. The end result looks less like a phone that was bent in half, and more like a subtle evolution of the Nexus Ss design language.Either way, the official reveal is coming in less than a week.
