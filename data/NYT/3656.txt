The Town Council in Braunau has unanimously decided to withdraw honorary citizenship from Hitler, 78 years after he was given the title. Hitler was actually born in the tiny village of Ranshofen, near Braunau, and became an honorary citizen of that hamlet in 1933. But Ranshofen became part of Braunau a few years later and thus is universally recognized as Hitler&rsquo;s birthplace. Braunau historians said they were not sure the honor was transferable from Ranshofen to Braunau. But the Town Council decided to abolish it late Thursday &mdash; just in case.
