WASHINGTON &mdash; A renewed effort to resolve Yemen&rsquo;s political crisis collapsed Wednesday after the Yemeni president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, again backed away from signing an agreement to transfer power, prompting Yemeni officials and analysts to warn that the stalemate could descend into factional violence.        

For weeks, Mr. Saleh and Yemen&rsquo;s opposition alliance have haggled over the deal brokered by the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council that would end his 33-year rule in exchange for immunity from prosecution for him and his family. On Wednesday, there were reports that Mr. Saleh, after more than three months of protests calling for his ouster, was ready to sign. John O. Brennan, President Obama&rsquo;s senior counterterrorism adviser, called Mr. Saleh on Wednesday morning and urged him to sign the deal, a White House statement said.        

But Mr. Saleh refused, saying three of the five people whose names were put forward by the opposition to sign the document were lower-level figures who could not be held accountable, according to a Yemeni official.        

The Gulf Cooperation Council&rsquo;s representative left Yemen on Wednesday, according to Yemeni news reports. That led many Yemenis to speculate that the bloc was losing hope.        

&ldquo;This basically closes the door for a peaceful transfer of power, unless something really unexpected takes place in the next couple of days,&rdquo; said Abdul Ghani al-Iryani, a political analyst in Sana, the Yemeni capital.
