Authorities have seized the tusks of 58 elephants, a ton of ivory, after sniffer dogs led investigators to containers at the country&rsquo;s main airport that were bound for Nigeria, officials said Friday. No arrests were made, the police said, and it was not immediately clear why the ivory was being transported to Nigeria; the most common destination for smuggled ivory is Asia. Patrick Omondi, an expert on elephants at the Kenya Wildlife Service, said ivory smuggling had increased since the 2007 temporary lifting of a ban by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species. It allowed a one-time sale by countries that had stockpiles of ivory from elephants that had died naturally or problem elephants killed by wildlife officials.
