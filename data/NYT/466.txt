Thousands of cheering Hamas supporters in Gaza on Wednesday burned effigies of the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, and his senior aides in the rival Palestinian leadership in the West Bank, denouncing them as traitors. The protests came in response to reports by Al Jazeera about leaked documents from Israeli-Palestinian negotiations. Al Jazeera says the documents show that Mr. Abbas had been willing to make far-reaching concessions on Jerusalem. Mr. Abbas has said Al Jazeera is distorting his position.
