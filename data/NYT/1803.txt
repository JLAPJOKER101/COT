Thailand has confiscated two tons of African elephant tusks worth millions of dollars being smuggled through a Bangkok port, in what authorities said Friday was the country&rsquo;s largest ivory seizure. The 247 tusks, some up to 6.5 feet long, were found Wednesday during an X-ray scan of a shipping container labeled as frozen mackerel, customs officials said. They valued the tusks at $3.3 million.
