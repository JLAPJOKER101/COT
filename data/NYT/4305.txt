Israel has recently advanced plans for the construction of 277 housing units in the Jewish settlement of Ariel, deep inside the West Bank, the defense minister&rsquo;s office said on Monday. The move, the latest in a flurry of settlement activity, comes ahead of Palestinian plans to seek United Nations recognition as a member state in the fall. Last week Israel&rsquo;s Interior Ministry announced approval for a contentious 1,600-apartment complex in East Jerusalem and said it would soon approve an additional 2,700 housing units there, prompting Palestinian fury and international criticism for undermining efforts to restart peace negotiations. Israel insists on keeping Ariel under any border agreement. The Palestinians claim that territory, conquered by Israel in the 1967 war, as part of a future state.
