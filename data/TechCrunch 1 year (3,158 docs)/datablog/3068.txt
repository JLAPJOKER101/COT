Ever since Google announced its $12.5 billion deal to acquire Motorola on Monday, its stock has been taking a hit.  Today, with the entire market in a tailspin over global economic concerns, Googles market cap is down $17.4 billion (in midday trading) since Fridays close. In other words, Google has lost more market value than the entire amount it is going to pay for Motorola.  And the proposed deal (which still must pass regulatory review) is all cash, so fluctuations in Googles share price wont affect the final amount Google has to pay.  Of course, by the time the deal closes probably next year Googles market cap will be vastly different than it is today.  And todays 22-point drop in Googles stock price is related more to the overall market rout than to the Googorola deal.  Still, as of yesterday, Googles market cap was down $10 billion since the deal was announced (based on Googles 326 million shares outstanding).  There is no getting around the fact that Wall Street does not like  this deal.  It makes you winder how much of that $17.4 billion of wiped out value can be chalked up to the deal versus the market tanking in general.
