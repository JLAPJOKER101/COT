The feared security chief of the ousted President Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali begged Tunisians for forgiveness during a court appearance on Wednesday. The security chief, Ali al-Seriati, was considered close to the Tunisian leader, and many accuse him of orchestrating violence after Mr. Ben Ali fled the country on Jan. 14 following an uprising. He was arrested shortly after Mr. Ben Ali&rsquo;s departure and was charged with providing the former leader&rsquo;s relatives with forged passports to help them escape.        

Mr. Seriati is facing separate charges of trying to sow chaos and internal strife in the wake of Mr. Ben Ali&rsquo;s overthrow. Mr. Seriati surprised lawyers in the court by shouting out at the close of the hearing: &ldquo;I ask the Tunisian people to forgive me. I am Tunisian and I love Tunisia.&rdquo;
