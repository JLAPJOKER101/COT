Three explosions shook the neighborhood of Dora in south Baghdad on Tuesday, killing at least 10 and wounding 28, according to a local security official. It was the third straight day in which Dora had been attacked. Dora is predominantly Sunni, although the attack on Tuesday evening occurred in a Shiite area. Improvised explosive devices and magnetic bombs were detonated on Sunday and Monday, injuring 12 people, including four police officers and a government official. Members of Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia have said they would increase attacks after Osama bin Laden&rsquo;s death.
