MOSCOW (Reuters) &mdash; Seven police officers and an emergency services worker were killed Tuesday in two suicide bomb attacks in Grozny, the capital of the restive province of Chechnya, during celebrations at the end of the Muslim festival of Ramadan, a police official told the Interfax news agency.        

A man detonated an explosive device when a police patrol tried to detain him, and a second blast occurred soon after, the unidentified police official told the news agency.        

The state-run RIA Novosti news agency quoted a police source as saying that two suicide bombers were responsible for the explosions.        

At least 16 people were wounded, Interfax reported.        

The site of the explosions, in a densely populated district of Grozny near a local Parliament building, was cordoned off by the police. Residents said they heard gunshots after the explosions.        

A decade after Russian forces drove separatists from power in Chechnya, the Kremlin is still struggling to contain an Islamist insurgency in the north Caucasus.        

The violence has now spread from Chechnya to other predominantly Muslim regions.        

Ramzan Kadyrov, the provincial leader who is backed by Moscow, told RIA Novosti: &ldquo;Today is the most sacred day for all Muslims. On that day a trained and zombified bandit attempted to carry out a terrorist attack. The bandits have shown their real face, which only proves that this evil should be eradicated.&rdquo;        

Mr. Kadyrov held an emergency government meeting, Interfax reported. The news agency said the situation in Grozny was under control.
