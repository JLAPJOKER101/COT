A recently published survey says the neogothic clock tower atop the British Parliament building is gently leaning to one side. The 315-foot tower, known as Big Ben, is leaning nearly 18 inches to the northwest, according to a 2009 parliamentary report recently obtained by The Sunday Telegraph. The tower has been slightly off center since it was erected in the mid-19th century, and its position has been shifting imperceptibly for years because of environmental factors like seasonal temperature and moisture-level changes. Experts said it was no cause for alarm.
