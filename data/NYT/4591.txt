An Amnesty International researcher said that Ethiopian officials had arrested two opposition politicians after members of the rights group interviewed them about politically motivated arrests. Claire Beston, the researcher, said she and a colleague spent 12 days in the nation last month before being suddenly told by the government to leave. Ms. Beston said the politicians were then arrested and accused of terrorism and links to the Oromo Liberation Front, a rebel group the government considers a terrorist organization. The Ethiopian authorities were not immediately available for comment on Wednesday.
