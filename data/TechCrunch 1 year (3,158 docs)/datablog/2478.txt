My first thought as I looked at 8 Securities, a new startup launching today at TC Disrupt Beijing, was, I didnt know financial dashboards could look sexy.But thats exactly what the Hong Kong-based startup has done: its built a service that combines elements of StockTwits, E*Trade, and iGoogles personalization to allow users to build a largely customized web interface for absorbing financial information and dealing with trades. Users can add widgets containing graphs, stock tickers, video streams, and other content, which they can arrange in whatever way theyd like.In addition to facilitating trades, the service also has a social component that allows investors to interact with each other — the company says its looking to break the mold of so-called one way advisor models by allowing investors to ask each other questions, and to syndicate their tips to social networks if theyd like.
		The company will initially be launching in Hong Kong, where they say there is a market of 1.2 million online brokerage accounts, and will be expanding further into China as regulations allow them to.This slideshow requires JavaScript.
