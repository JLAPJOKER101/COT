The United States military sent a Guant&aacute;namo prisoner back to his native Algeria on Thursday over the objections of his lawyers, who said he feared being tortured in his homeland. The prisoner, Saiid Farhi, had been held without charge at the American base in Cuba for nearly nine years. A federal court in Washington ordered his release in November 2009, finding that the government failed to prove he was a member of Al Qaeda or the Taliban.
