The former head of the Central Bank will be prosecuted in connection with the bank&rsquo;s failure, the Afghan attorney general&rsquo;s office said Tuesday. The bank official, Abdul Qadir Fitrat, had fled to the United States, where he said he had permanent resident status, and resigned on Monday. He and colleagues face allegations of failing to act on warnings about widespread corruption at Kabul Bank, which nearly collapsed last year. Rahmatullah Nazari, Afghanistan&rsquo;s deputy attorney general, told reporters that an arrest warrant for Mr. Fitrat had been sent to Interpol and the United States Embassy. Mr. Fitrat has said he and others were being made scapegoats.
