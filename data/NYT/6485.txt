Security forces used tear gas and stun grenades to disperse hundreds of antigovernment protesters alongside a highway leading to the capital on Thursday. The clashes, near the town of Diraz and other villages west of the capital, Manama, came during a visit by the United States State Department&rsquo;s top human rights envoy, who expressed concern about the government&rsquo;s use of tear gas and other tough tactics against protesters.
