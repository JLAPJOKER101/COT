An American prosecutor will investigate accusations that Prime Minister Hashim Thaci of Kosovo led a criminal network that sold organs taken from civilian captives during the Kosovo war for independence from Serbia in 1998-99, the European Union Mission in Kosovo said on Monday. The prosecutor, John Clint Williamson, was named as leader of a task force set up to investigate the accusations, which were raised in a report last year by the Council of Europe. Mr. Thaci has denied the accusations and has said he is ready to cooperate with any investigation.
