The Turkish military carried out airstrikes in northern Iraq for a second day in pursuit of Kurdish separatist rebels suspected of attacking Turkey from bases in the mountainous border region. Warplanes hit 28 rebel locations, and artillery shelled 96 targets, the army said Friday. Meanwhile, the rebels &mdash; from the P.K.K., or Kurdistan Workers Party &mdash; struck two military posts in Siirt Province, in the southeast, killing two soldiers and wounding three civilians, the semiofficial Anatolian Agency reported. More than 40 people have been killed since separatist violence escalated in July, which led to this week&rsquo;s intense military operations.
