Two American men were shot and killed in Tijuana as they waited in line to cross the border into San Diego, the Baja California State authorities said Tuesday. Kevin Romero, 28, and Sergio Salcido, 25, who lived near the beach outside Tijuana and worked at a brewery equipment company in San Diego, were shot before 3 a.m. Monday on their way to work. Matt Pelot, who employed the two men, said that Mr. Romero had told him he was living with a Mexican woman and hoped to adopt her son. Ra&uacute;l Guti&eacute;rrez, a spokesperson for the state attorney general&rsquo;s office, said the authorities believed that the killings were unlikely to have been tied to drug trafficking.
