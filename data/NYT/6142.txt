BAGHDAD &mdash; The American military command in Iraq usually declines to acknowledge insurgent rocket strikes on its bases, not wanting the enemy attackers to know whether they have hit something. But the Americans made an exception on Friday.        

In a statement about the risks to civilians of insurgent rocket and mortar fire near American bases &mdash; a message that was intended for an Iraqi audience and distributed to the local news media in Arabic &mdash; the command disclosed that Katyusha rockets fired at a base outside Babil, south of Baghdad, three days earlier had wounded two American soldiers who are among the last several thousand in Iraq.        

The statement suggested such rocket attacks had been staged for propaganda purposes to create the impression that the Americans are fleeing under fire after more than eight years of war.        

&ldquo;Terrorists groups are conducting attacks against American forces in order to create a false idea that they have forced us to leave,&rdquo; the statement said.        

The remaining American forces here are packing up, facing a Dec. 31 deadline to leave under an agreement negotiated with the Iraqi government.        

Katyusha rockets are low-technology weapons whose accuracy is imprecise. They have not proved effective against the Americans in Iraq, but that does not mean that the United States forces still in the country do not take them seriously.        

The military&rsquo;s statement said two Katyushas were fired Tuesday, with one of them striking the Kalsu Base. American troops discovered that several other rockets had failed to launch.        

The public relations office of the American military command in Baghdad did not respond to a query about the attack.        

As it withdraws, the American military is moving its forces deployed in the north into bases farther south, toward the Kuwaiti border.
