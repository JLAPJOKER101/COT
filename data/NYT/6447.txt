China is considering an offer from the Indian Ocean island nation of Seychelles to allow Chinese naval ships to visit for rest and resupply there, China&rsquo;s Defense Ministry said Tuesday. The ships would be part of a multinational force conducting anti-piracy patrols off Somalia. China has taken part in the patrols since late 2008, and Chinese ships assigned to patrols in the Gulf of Aden have made similar visits to ports including those in Yemen and Oman on the Arabian Peninsula and Djibouti on the Horn of Africa. Chinese naval activity in the Indian Ocean is of interest to India, which has longstanding border disputes with China and is suspicious of China&rsquo;s close ties with Pakistan.
