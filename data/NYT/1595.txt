RAS AJDIR, Tunisia (Agence France-Presse) &mdash; Three journalists who were arrested in Libya last weekend by forces loyal to Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi arrived in Tunisia on Wednesday after being released overnight.        

Dave Clark and Roberto Schmidt, who work for Agence France-Presse, and Joe Raedle from Getty Images crossed the border at Ras Ajdir shortly after noon and were driving to Tunis, the capital, about 370 miles to the north. They were released early on Wednesday morning after an appeal by Agence France-Presse. The journalists were arrested Saturday near the town of Ajdabiya in eastern Libya.        

Mr. Clark, 38, a former Baghdad bureau chief, had been in Libya since March 8. Mr. Schmidt, 45, who normally works out of Agence France-Presse&rsquo;s bureau in Nairobi, Kenya, arrived in Libya on Feb. 28. Mr. Raedle, 45, is an American citizen.        

Their release follows that of four journalists for The New York Times who were detained by government forces, but four journalists with Al Jazeera remain in detention. At least two journalists have been killed in the conflict.
