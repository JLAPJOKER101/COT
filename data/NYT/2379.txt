A court on Monday dismissed the last two remaining charges against former President Manuel Zelaya, removing a key obstacle to his return to the country. The decision could also smooth the way for the country&rsquo;s return to the Organization of American States, which expelled Honduras after the 2009 coup that ousted Mr. Zelaya. A special appeals court panel dismissed charges of fraud and falsifying documents, saying they might have improperly overlapped with civil law and should be vacated. Federal prosecutors said they would appeal the decision.
