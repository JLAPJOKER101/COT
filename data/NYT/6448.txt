The newly elected chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court pledged on Tuesday to strengthen efforts to bring to justice those who commit sex crime. A day after her election, Fatou Bensouda, a Gambian lawyer who is to assume her new duties in mid-2012, said that too often sex crimes go unreported and unpunished and that the victims are denigrated and silenced. Crimes like rape and sexual slavery are at the center of six of the court&rsquo;s first cases.
