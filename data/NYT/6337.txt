The Italian police on Wednesday arrested a powerful leader of a criminal group based outside Naples, dealing the group, known as the Camorra, one of its most powerful blows in years.        

The arrested crime boss, Michele Zagaria, 53, the head of the so-called Casalesi clan, had evaded capture for 16 years before a police raid found him early Wednesday in an underground bunker in the town of Casapesenna, a Camorra stronghold 25 miles outside Naples.        

Known for his brutality, Mr. Zagaria was sentenced in absentia to life in prison for murder. He was also wanted for criminal association, kidnapping, extortion and other crimes.        

Interior Minister Annamaria Cancellieri called the arrest &ldquo;a huge success by the state, not only against the Casalesi clan but against the entire Camorra organization.&rdquo;        

&nbsp;Based in the southern region of Campania, the Camorra is involved in drug dealing, extortion and smuggling of illegal immigrants, as well as the garment industry, garbage removal, construction and public works, both in Italy and abroad.        

&nbsp;The Camorra organization inspired &ldquo;Gomorrah,&rdquo; the 2006 best-selling book by Italian journalist Roberto Saviano, and a prizewinning film two years later. Mr. Saviano now lives under police protection.
