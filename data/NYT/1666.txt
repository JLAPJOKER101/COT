Swaziland&rsquo;s cabinet agreed to 10 percent salary cuts, a week after a huge pro-democracy protest in the tiny nation&rsquo;s usually quiet capital. The cuts, in addition to three-year salary freezes for cabinet ministers, will save the government $34.9 million over the next three years, Prime Minister Barnabas Sibusiso Dlamini said Thursday. An antimonarchy movement has gained momentum since the government proposed freezing civil service wages while King Mswati III gave himself a 24 percent increase in his budget allocation. The proposed wage freezes brought 7,000 demonstrators to Swaziland&rsquo;s capital city of Mbabane, one of the largest protests ever seen in sub-Saharan Africa&rsquo;s last absolute monarchy. The crowd marched to the prime minister&rsquo;s office and was peaceful.
