Investigators have charged a former police officer with providing surveillance information and a murder weapon to the killer of the prominent journalist Anna Politkovskaya, whose shooting death in 2006 brought widespread condemnation of violence against journalists in Russia. But like the earlier arrest of a person suspected of being a gunman, the announcement left unanswered the larger question of who ordered the killing of Ms. Politkovskaya, a crusading reporter who had persisted in writing critical articles about the war in Chechnya. The defendant, Dmitri Pavlyuchenkov, a former lieutenant colonel in a police surveillance unit, has denied the accusation.
