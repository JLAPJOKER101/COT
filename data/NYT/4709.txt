Bahrain on Wednesday released a group of doctors who had held a hunger strike over their detention during a government crackdown on protests, but investigators from an independent commission said more than 80 other detainees were also refusing food. The doctors were among dozens of medical professionals rounded up in March when the Gulf state&rsquo;s Sunni rulers crushed pro-democracy protests led mainly by Shiites. The arrests of the doctors attracted international concern. Many had been released earlier, but 14 doctors remained in custody. The state news media said a military court had released them until Sept. 29, when it will issue verdicts in some of the cases.
