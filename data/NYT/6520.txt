Myanmar is negotiating peace with major ethnic rebel groups and is determined to achieve a permanent peace with them in three to four years, the government&rsquo;s top negotiator said Friday. Peace talks are being held with the Shan, Mon, Karen, Kayah and Kachin groups, with the government&rsquo;s only condition being that the groups not demand to secede, said Aung Thaung, who leads the government&rsquo;s Peace Committee. He said that President Thein Sein had ordered an end to fighting with Kachin rebels in the north on Dec. 10, but skirmishes have continued because communicating with troops in remote areas was difficult.
