Prosecutors in Iran issued a public warning to a prominent banker that he will become the prime suspect in a huge embezzlement scandal if he does not return to the country, the Mehr News Agency reported Thursday. The banker, Mahomud-Reza Khavari, abruptly resigned as the managing director of Bank Melli, Iran&rsquo;s largest commercial bank, on Tuesday and flew to Canada after the bank was among several implicated in what prosecutors said was a $2.6 billion scheme to use forged letters of credit to acquire privatized government assets. Spokesmen for the bank told Iranian news outlets that Mr. Khavari had gone to Canada for ordinary business reasons.
