A Rwandan journalist who was a prominent critic of Rwanda&rsquo;s president was fatally shot in a bar in Kampala, Uganda, the Ugandan police said Friday. Charles Ingabire, editor of the Web site Inyenyeri News, had been living as a political refugee in Kampala. He was killed around midnight on Thursday, police officers said. The police said they were investigating and did not provide a motive. Rwandan exiles blamed Rwandan security forces, citing the killing of an opposition official and a journalist in Rwanda last year, and the attack on a former Rwandan Army chief in South Africa. Rwanda has denied accusations that it targets its opponents abroad.
