ISLAMABAD, Pakistan &mdash; At least six people were killed on Monday when a suicide bomber detonated explosives in northern Pakistan, according to reports in local news media. At least 15 people were reported to have been wounded.        

The attack took place before a political meeting of the Pakistan Muslim League-Q, a national political party that is in coalition with the ruling Pakistan Peoples Party, in Battagram in northwestern Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Province.        

There was no immediate claim of responsibility but Taliban insurgents have often targeted security forces as well as government officials and installations.        

Amir Muqam, a leader of the Pakistan Muslim League-Q and a federal cabinet minister, was to address the rally. It was not immediately clear if the bomber&rsquo;s target was Mr. Muqam specifically.        

Mr. Muqam was on his way to the rally from another district and had not reached Battagram when the attack took place, according to his brother, Jan Wali, who was reached by telephone.        

Mr. Muqam has escaped several assassination attempts, Mr. Wali said in a telephone interview.        

Elsewhere, two explosions at a Pakistani Army arms depot on the outskirts of Islamabad on Monday morning killed one soldier and wounded three, an army spokesman said. The explosions appeared to be accidental, police and army officials said.
