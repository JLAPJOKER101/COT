PARIS &mdash; The arrest in New York of one of France&rsquo;s leading global figures and a possible next president, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, on charges of attempted rape produced an earthquake of shock, outrage, disbelief and embarrassment throughout France on Sunday.        

The country woke up to the tawdry allegations that Mr. Strauss-Kahn, 62, a leading Socialist and the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, had waylaid and tried to rape a maid in a $3,000-a-night suite at a New York hotel, and the reverberations were immediate.        

The government of President Nicolas Sarkozy responded cautiously, saying the presumption of innocence must be maintained and the courts must be allowed to do their work, while the leader of the Socialist Party, Martine Aubry, admitted that she was &ldquo;totally stupefied&rdquo; by the charges against the man who had been considered most likely to bring her party back to power in next year&rsquo;s presidential elections by defeating Mr. Sarkozy.        

Some, including Mr. Strauss-Kahn&rsquo;s wife, the American-born French television journalist Anne Sinclair, expressed disbelief in the charges and faith in her husband&rsquo;s innocence. His lawyer has said he would plead not guilty. Others talked darkly of a possible &ldquo;setup&rdquo; of Mr. Sarkozy&rsquo;s most prominent rival.        

But there was a general recognition that whatever the outcome &mdash; unless the police have made a horrible error &mdash; the arrest had exploded Mr. Strauss-Kahn&rsquo;s political hopes, upended France&rsquo;s political landscape and abruptly ended his career at the I.M.F., which is in the middle of crucial negotiations about loans for distressed nations of the European Union. The I.M.F. quickly appointed an acting managing director on Sunday to replace Mr. Strauss-Kahn, who spent hours in a Manhattan holding cell awaiting arraignment, which was postponed until Monday after additional evidence was sought including DNA samples from his fingernails and skin.        

As the impact of Mr. Strauss-Kahn&rsquo;s predicament hit home, others, including some in the news media, began to reveal accounts, long suppressed or anonymous, of what they called Mr. Strauss-Kahn&rsquo;s previously predatory behavior toward women and his aggressive sexual pursuit of them, from students and journalists to subordinates.        

Mr. Strauss-Kahn&rsquo;s extramarital affairs have long been considered an open secret. But the legal charges against him &mdash; which include attempted rape, an illegal sexual act and an effort to sequester another person against her will &mdash; are of an entirely different magnitude, even in France and elsewhere in continental Europe, where voters have generally shown more lenience than Americans toward the sexual behavior of prominent politicians, most notably the sexual escapades of Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi of Italy.        

&ldquo;If the accusations turn out to be true &mdash; and even if they are proved false &mdash; this is a degrading thing,&rdquo; said Fran&ccedil;ois Bayrou, a centrist who ran for the presidency in 2007.        

The left-leaning newspaper Lib&eacute;ration ran the headline &ldquo;Shock. Political Bomb. Thunderclap.&rdquo;        

The deputy editor, Vincent Giret, wrote sadly on Sunday that Mr. Strauss-Kahn seemed &ldquo;best-armed to respond to the disarray of the French, exhausted by the crisis and disoriented by the crazy reign of Sarkozy.&rdquo; But Mr. Strauss-Kahn apparently believed he could win the presidency &ldquo;without fighting,&rdquo; Mr. Giret said, and so did not follow a path of &ldquo;renunciation and abnegation.&rdquo;        

The entire French political world used superlatives to comment on Mr. Strauss-Kahn&rsquo;s arrest. Dominique Paill&eacute;, the former spokesman of Mr. Sarkozy&rsquo;s party, called it a &ldquo;historical moment, in negative terms, in French politics.&rdquo; Other Sarkozy supporters were predictably harsh.        

The government spokesman, Fran&ccedil;ois Baroin, said that Mr. Strauss-Kahn should be afforded &ldquo;the presumption of innocence.&rdquo; The government, he told France 2 television, would &ldquo;not go further in commentary about this matter&rdquo; and called for &ldquo;extraordinary prudence&rdquo; in discussing the case.
