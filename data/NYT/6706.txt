An Iranian court began hearings on Tuesday in the trial of a man who appeared on state television this month and confessed to being an American spy sent to infiltrate the intelligence services of Iran.        

The man, identified as Amir Mirzaei Hekmati, an Iranian-American born in Arizona in 1983, repeated his confession to the court, the semiofficial Fars News Agency reported. He said that he was trained in languages and espionage after joining the United States Army following his high school graduation in 2001, and that he had been sent to Iran by the Central Intelligence Agency.        

&ldquo;In this mission I was fooled by the C.I.A., and although I had entered Iran with a mission to infiltrate in the Islamic Republic of Iran&rsquo;s intelligence systems and to turn into a new source for the C.I.A., I didn&rsquo;t want to hit a blow to Iran,&rdquo; he was quoted as telling the judge.        

In the television interview, broadcast on Dec. 18, Mr. Hekmati described his mission as one in which he would first gain the trust of the Iranian authorities by handing over information and then penetrate the Iranian intelligence services.        

The claims made in the interview and repeated before the Iranian court could not be verified. The C.I.A. declined to comment on the matter when the interview was broadcast.        

Mr. Hekmati&rsquo;s father, who lives in Michigan, told The Associated Press that his son had been visiting his grandmothers in Iran when he was detained. The Iranian Intelligence Ministry said that its agents had tracked him from Bagram air base in Afghanistan, where a large number of American forces are based, and that they arrested him after he entered Iran.        

Accusations by Iran of espionage inside its borders are common, and Iran often announces that it has captured or executed people it says are spies for Western powers and Israel.
