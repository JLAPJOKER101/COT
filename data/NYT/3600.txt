An Israeli missile strike killed two Palestinians and wounded a third in central Gaza on Tuesday, according to a medical spokesman for the Hamas-led government there. The Israeli military said the victims had been preparing to fire a rocket at Israel and were believed to be members of an Islamic extremist group. Hamas and Israel have largely adhered to an unofficial cease-fire since the spring, but the Israeli military said three rockets had been fired from Gaza into Israeli territory this week.
