Cuba has agreed to release four more political prisoners and send them to Spain, Roman Catholic Church officials said in Havana on Wednesday.  President Ra&uacute;l Castro agreed last July to release 52 political prisoners over a four-month period that ended late last year. Most of the 52 have left for Spain with their families, but several rejected the offer and remain incarcerated.
