Prosecutors are charging a jailed American contractor with &ldquo;acts against the integrity and independence&rdquo; of Cuba and requesting a 20-year jail term, state news media reported Friday. The contractor, Alan Gross, 60, has been jailed without charge since December 2009 on suspicion of spying. The United States and his family say he was distributing satellite telephones to the island&rsquo;s Jewish community. They have called for him to be released or tried. The Web site Cubadebate said that a trial date would be set shortly and that Mr. Gross&rsquo;s family and American diplomats would be allowed to attend.
