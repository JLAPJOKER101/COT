Fashion For Home, the online designer furniture store, has scored a new funding round led by the Munich-based VC Acton Capital Partners, while Holtzbrinck Ventures has also participated. And with it we have an exit of sorts.Thats because, as part of the round, the Samwer brothers’ incubator, Rocket Internet, has sold its shares, although terms of the transaction arent being disclosed  unsurprising given the Samwers notorious reputation for secrecy. Its also especially curious when you factor in last years leaked memo where Oliver Samwer described ambitions to become number one” in the e-commerce sector for furniture with a strategy he controversially likened to blitzkrieg.Fashion For Homes new funding round as a whole is said to be in the lower double-digit millions, so also make of that what you will.Operating out of Berlin, but targeting Germany, the UK, U.S., Austria and the Netherlands, Fashion For Home sells designer furniture online through an innovative vertically integrated made-to-order production process and business model and its this that enables it to be competitive as costs are kept low and savings passed on to customers. Its a model that is strikingly similar to the UKs Made.com.Fashion For Home was founded in 2009 by Marc Appelhoff and Christoph Cordes.
