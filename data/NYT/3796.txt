PARIS        

JOHNNY HALLYDAY hasn&rsquo;t left the building, at least not yet.        

It&rsquo;s not that he hasn&rsquo;t tried &mdash; there have been a couple of suicide attempts, and even an effort at retirement. But that didn&rsquo;t last very long, he said in a long and good-natured interview. &ldquo;I realized that if it had been my last tour, it would be finished today, and then what would I do?&rdquo; He laughed and said, &ldquo;I like to be on stage, I like the public, I like to see people, it&rsquo;s always been part of my life, since I was 14.&rdquo;        

And then he nearly died, after a botched 2009 operation on his back by a celebrity surgeon.        

Mr. Hallyday, now 68, has survived three previous marriages, kidney stones, a bout with colon cancer and the bungled operation on his spine, which became infected. He had the operation here and was cleared to return to his home in Los Angeles, but once there he had to be put into a medically induced coma for a second operation. While he was unconscious, a tube touched his vocal cords, and his famous gravelly voice, which has survived so many songs, became a whisper. But he brought it back with exercises, sometimes trying to talk while biting a pencil, he said, the way he did when he burned his tongue as a boy, and at 14 taught himself not to lisp.        

The French surgeon is being sued; Mr. Hallyday, after having another operation to replace an artificial hip installed after a motorcycle accident more than 20 years ago &mdash; &ldquo;my hip was getting old,&rdquo; he said &mdash; has gone back to performing. He will appear in his first play this September in Paris, in a French version of Tennessee Williams&rsquo;s &ldquo;Kingdom of Earth,&rdquo; then start another tour that will last more than a year, with an average of four concerts a week and only one month off &mdash; the holy French month of August, of course.        

A small, wiry man with a look that mingles Western and French &mdash; tight black jeans, a black vest with silver buttons, a studded belt, and his fingers crammed with rings, including a diamond-studded skull &mdash; Mr. Hallyday now is trying to stop smoking. So he alternates days of cigarettes with days of nicotine patches. Today was a smoking day &mdash; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m working,&rdquo; he said simply, with a flash of his watery blue eyes from underneath his heavy lids &mdash; and by the time the interview was over, half a pack of filterless Gitanes were crammed into an ashtray.        

It is hard to explain the place he has in French life &mdash; he has done more than 100 tours, sold more than 100 million records, made 47 studio albums and 26 live ones. He has been on more than 2,100 magazine covers, and his Wikipedia entry in French is longer than Jesus Christ&rsquo;s.        

Johnny Hallyday is as French as the baguette, and he has been singing for more than 50 years, bringing Elvis rhythms, energy and glitter to a culture steeped in ballads. Like him or not (President Nicolas Sarkozy is a huge fan), few here are indifferent to him. His opinion is sought about everything, from restaurants to Dominique Strauss-Kahn. &ldquo;I suppose the French got used to me after all this time,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Somewhere, I&rsquo;m a little part of the family.&rdquo;        

He described visiting sick children on tour, &ldquo;and on the fireplace I see pictures of me in the middle of pictures of the family,&rdquo; he said with some astonishment still. &ldquo;French people moan a lot, &lsquo;I hate this, I don&rsquo;t like this.&rsquo; But they are very fid&egrave;le, very loyal, to what they like. They can say bad things about it, but they&rsquo;re very loyal.&rdquo;        

Born Jean-Philippe Smet, Mr. Hallyday had a distant relationship with his father, who was already married to another woman when he was born, an emptiness that he knows marked him in still unresolved ways. &ldquo;I was very obsessed about the father I never had, and it was very hard to accept that in my mind,&rdquo; he said, though he also knows it made him both tough and ambitious. But now married, for a fourth time, to Laeticia Boudou, Mr. Hallyday, with two grown children, has adopted two more, both from Vietnam, Jade, 6, and Joy, nearly 3, and does his best to spend time with them.

&ldquo;Not to have seen my first two kids grow up in my house made me very lonely,&rdquo; he said. His daughter Laura Smet, 27, born from a relationship with the famed actress Nathalie Baye, has also been troubled, with her own attempts at suicide. &ldquo;She became an actress of course,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and actresses are more complicated.&rdquo;        

IN Los Angeles, at least, where he went in part to escape high French taxes, his children are untouched by his celebrity, since few Americans outside the music world know who he is. That is even though the Jimi Hendrix Experience had its debut as an opening act for Mr. Hallyday in 1966 in Europe. (Mr. Hallyday dedicates a song to Hendrix, &ldquo;Guitar Hero,&rdquo; on his latest album).        

Mr. Hallyday has been in movies, however, and sometimes Americans stop him on the street. &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t even know I&rsquo;m a singer,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They say, &lsquo;Great movie, man, we saw you in &lsquo;Man on the Train.&rsquo; It&rsquo;s very strange for me.&rdquo;        

He has never been very big in America, though in 1962 he was on &ldquo;The Ed Sullivan Show.&rdquo; He spoke little English in those years, and he was touring all the time. &ldquo;To try to work in the U.S. is like beginning a whole new career, and for that you need time,&rdquo; he said.        

His record company was American. &ldquo;But I was in the French department, and that didn&rsquo;t help you very much to export to other countries.&rdquo; The company once pushed him to record an album in English (&ldquo;Rough Town&rdquo; in 1994), &ldquo;and then they released it in Europe,&rdquo; he said, shaking his head. &ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t even make me do any promotion in the States.&rdquo;        

But his albums remain popular. A 2005 album, &ldquo;Ma V&eacute;rit&eacute;&rdquo; (&ldquo;My Truth&rdquo;), sold more than 500,000 copies. In the Internet, music-stealing age, he said, that &ldquo;is like selling two million before.&rdquo;        

His near-death experience in 2009 changed him, he said. &ldquo;I used to forget that every morning when you wake up, and you can breathe and can see the sun or the rain and speak on the telephone with a friend and see your family, your kids growing up, it&rsquo;s so normal it doesn&rsquo;t touch you. But when you pass through nearly dying, you realize every morning it&rsquo;s a gift of God, it&rsquo;s &lsquo;Merci la vie.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;        

For his last album, &ldquo;Jamais Seul&rdquo; (&ldquo;Never Alone&rdquo;), recorded after he recovered, he talked for two months with his favorite lyricists, Matthieu Chedid and Maxim Nucci, &ldquo;about life, friendship, love and disappointment, and then we started to write the songs little by little with what I was feeling.&rdquo; The album is about old friends and memories, with a song dedicated to his wife.        

Having done so much in his career, he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just going on, I don&rsquo;t have to prove much.&rdquo; But he does think about endings, and he says he has a nightmare that he will die and leave his young children with nothing.        

When he was young, he said, he met Maurice Chevalier and sang a few songs for him. Chevalier said: &ldquo;Look, kid, I don&rsquo;t know if one day you&rsquo;ll sing. But remember&rdquo; &mdash; and here Mr. Hallyday broke into French &mdash; &ldquo;always take care of your entrance and your exit. And in the middle, just sing as well as you can.&rdquo;        

Mr. Hallyday took another Gitane. &ldquo;I always took that advice,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;So I always try to find a new entrance.&rdquo; As for the exit, it&rsquo;s still too early to say.
