Apple stock fell 4.1% on Monday, continuing a five day skid and a trend that has drained $50 billion in market capital from the company and dropped share price from a high of $643 on April 10 to its current price of $580.Apple has been flying high lately, weathering dual storms of Jobs-Cook succession and, most recently, Mike Daiseys Foxconn fabrications. The stock is up in early trading and many analysts are holding firm to an expected $700 target, calling this a softening and not a correction.Even investors are taking the loss in stride.
