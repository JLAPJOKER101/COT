Britain will amend rules allowing the police to hold terrorism suspects for up to 28 days before they must be charged with a crime or released, officials said Thursday. A new limit of 14 days will take effect on Tuesday, said Damian Green, a Home Office minister. The 28-day detention rule was introduced by the Labour government in 2006, after the London bombings of July 2005, but the police have not held anyone longer than 14 days since July 2007, Mr. Green said. Nonetheless, he said that officials would draw up emergency laws to prepare for &ldquo;very exceptional circumstances&rdquo; when a longer detention might be necessary. Home Secretary Theresa May plans to announce more details of a sweeping review of the government&rsquo;s counterterrorism measures on Wednesday.
