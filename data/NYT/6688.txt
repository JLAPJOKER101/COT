Potentially substandard breast implants made by a French company were sold to about 1,000 Dutch women under a second name, broadening the scope of an investigation that could affect some 300,000 women worldwide. A health spokeswoman for the Netherlands said on Monday that a Dutch company had bought implants made by Poly Implants Proth&egrave;ses of France, which was closed last year, and sold them in the Netherlands as &ldquo;M-implants.&rdquo; She declined to name the Dutch company. The French company used an inferior, industrial-grade silicone in the implants and are more likely to rupture or ooze than those made from surgical silicone. The French authorities stressed that the leaked gel carries no known link to cancer.
