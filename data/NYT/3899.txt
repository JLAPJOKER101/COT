The Mexican Army has seized about 925 tons of chemicals used for making methamphetamine in a raid in Central Mexico, one of the biggest finds of its kind ever made in the country. The seizure took place in a warehouse in an industrial area in Queretaro, about 125 miles north of Mexico City, the Defense Ministry said in a statement late Wednesday. According to local news media reports and a leading analyst, it was the largest seizure of meth chemicals since President Felipe Calder&oacute;n called for an army-led crackdown on Mexico&rsquo;s drug cartels shortly after taking office at the end of 2006. Meth, a stimulant, is smuggled into the United States and sold in crystal or powder form.
