More than 200,000 South African municipal workers walked off the job Monday, a trade union said. Disruptions are expected for garbage collection and water repairs in urban areas. Workers at the municipal union are asking formally for a wage increase of 18 percent, well above the 5 percent inflation rate, and have said they will not settle for less than a double-digit increase. Employers have offered 6 percent.
