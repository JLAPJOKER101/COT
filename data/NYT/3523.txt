Church of England bishops said Friday that they had temporarily barred priests in civil partnerships from being appointed as bishops. The church&rsquo;s policy is that gay male priests who are celibate are eligible to become bishops. The statement from the House of Bishops said a review of civil relationships would be completed next year.
