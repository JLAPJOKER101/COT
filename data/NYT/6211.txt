A fire that began in market stalls in Hong Kong early Wednesday spread to homes in a crowded neighborhood, killing 9 people and injuring at least 34, the police said. People rushed to the roofs of their apartment buildings as the fire spread in Mongkok, an area packed with stalls selling toys, clothes and accessories. On the Kowloon Peninsula across the harbor from Hong Kong Island, Mongkok is among the world&rsquo;s most densely populated neighborhoods. The police said that they were investigating the origin of the fire, which was not brought under control until midday, because it appeared to be suspicious.
