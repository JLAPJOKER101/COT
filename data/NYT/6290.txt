The United Nations Security Council expanded sanctions against Eritrea on Monday for continuing to provide support to Islamist militants in Somalia, including the Shabab. The council resolution requires countries to make their companies involved in Eritrean mining exercise &ldquo;vigilance&rdquo; to ensure that funds are not used to destabilize the region. Earlier drafts had sought to ban investment in Eritrea&rsquo;s mining industry and outlaw imports of its minerals. Eritrea, which is already subject to an arms embargo, denies aiding the Shabab or any other militant groups in Somalia.
