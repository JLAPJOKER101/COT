In case you havent noticed ;), its an especially slooooooooooooooooooooow time for the tech industry. So slow that some Aol employees  the only one I recognize is Sol Lipman  made a video about the recent Aol talent exodus, using ZOMBIES as a metaphor for all the people whove decided to leave Aol.If I understand the video correctly, the zombie attack was apparently sparked by some design changes made to the Huffington Post (rimshot), which turn recent departures Brad Garlinghouse and Kiersten Hollars into zombies, who in turn zombify the rest of Aols Palo Alto HQ.We should have quit when Maser left! is a reference to Aol VP Mike Maser, who was formerly at Digg.While the video honestly isnt that funny, it is sort of endearing, as the employees come to realize that the only way to fend off the zombie attacks (/talent exodus) is with quality Aol products like Editions  which literally kill zombies in the movie.* Using the acronym MAMA (Mail Aim Mobile About.me) to fight of the undead, the Aol* survivors proclaim 2012 as the year the company turns around, Our friends may have been eaten by Zombies, but were still going to have a lot of fun.Awwwwwwwwww.* Which is weird, because theyre inadvertently comparing Aol products to a bullet to the head, but I digress.*Yes, I know its officially AOL (not Aol), but I just write it this way to piss off Robin  who for some reason is really stubborn about us spelling it in all UPPERCASE.
