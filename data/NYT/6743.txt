Large seizures of elephant tusks made 2011 the worst year on record for elephants since ivory sales were banned in 1989, experts said on Thursday. Recent estimates suggest that as many as 3,000 elephants were killed by poachers, according to the International Fund for Animal Welfare, an advocacy group. Tom Milliken, an elephant and rhino specialist for Traffic, a wildlife trade monitoring network, said that most cases involve the smuggling of ivory from Africa into Asia, where growing wealth has fed the desire for ivory ornaments and for rhino horn that is used in traditional medicine, though scientists have proved it has no medicinal value.
