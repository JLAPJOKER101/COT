Remember that one time Motorola and Verizon announced the new Droid RAZR, but failed to offer up any in-store availability dates? A date as vague as November can only tide over the masses for so long, which may be why Verizon passed along this internal document (full-size below) to Droid-Life, which details in-store availability across all channels on November 10. The beastly 4G-LTE packin RAZR will go for $299.99 on-contract.In similar news, UK retailer Clove had originally listed RAZR availability for November 1, but then changed it to the week commencing 7 November, reports Pocket-Lint. In other words, itll probably arrive in customer hands by the 10th. As a refresher, the Droid RAZR boasts a 7.1mm waist line making it the worlds thinnest smartphone, or so says Motorola. It packs a 1.2GHz dual-core processor, Android 2.3 Gingerbread (with a promised update to Ice Cream Sandwich), and support for Verizons 4G LTE network. Youll find an 8-megapixel shooter on the back capable of video capture in 1080p, along with a 1.3-megapixel front-facing cam for video chat. Along with its 4.3-inch qHD Super AMOLED 960Ã—540 display, the phone also ships with a Kevlar fiber casing along the back, to withstand the back pocket test.
