If youre not happy with the changes Facebook made with regards to the News Feed, and the addition of the Ticker, theres an easy way to revert back to the old Facebook user interface.Simply go to your Account Settings and change your language to anything but English (US). If you only speak English, you can simply pick English (UK) and it will change back to the previous lay-out.Apologies if this has been covered elsewhere already (I didnt find any reports on the usual suspect news sites and blogs straight away) but this is currently making the rounds on Twitter. Obviously, its just a matter of time before Facebook rolls out the new UI across all territories / languages covered by the social networking service provider, so this is merely a temporary fix for those who have trouble accepting and embracing changes. And you are in abundance.Update: some people tell me this no longer works, but it does for me, and, from the looks of it, for most people. If it doesnt work for you, apologies and remember, after rain comes sunshine.Heres a video of some cute puppies kissing each other to brighten your day:(Thanks to Anand Choudhary for the heads up)
