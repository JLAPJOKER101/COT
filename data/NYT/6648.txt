A Soyuz spacecraft safely delivered a Russian, an American and a Dutchman to the International Space Station on Friday, restoring the permanent crew to six members for the first time since September. But a different version of the Soyuz rocket failed to launch a satellite because of an engine failure, the latest in a string of launching failures that have raised questions about the state of Russia&rsquo;s space industry. The failed launching of a cargo ship in August had raised doubts about future missions to the station, because the Soyuz rocket that crashed used the same upper stage as the booster rockets carrying Soyuz ships to orbit. &ldquo;What happened today was a highly unpleasant situation,&rdquo; said the head of Russia&rsquo;s space agency, Vladimir Popovkin, above, according to state news agencies. &ldquo;It confirms that the industry is in crisis and its weakest link is engine building.&rdquo;
