At least 54 people have been detained in the current crackdown on progressive thought and speech in China, according to a statement released Thursday by China Human Rights Defenders, an advocacy group. The latest person to be detained is Ni Yulan, a housing activist and former lawyer, after previously being tortured by security officers. Ms. Ni and her husband, Dong Jiqin, were taken on April 7 from a Beijing hotel where they had been living. Ms. Ni has not been charged with a crime. So far, four people have been criminally charged during the crackdown. Ms. Ni is likely to have come under increased scrutiny after Jon Huntsman Jr., the American ambassador, visited her in February. Mr. Huntsman and the United States government are suspected by some Chinese officials of promoting the calls for a so-called Jasmine Revolution to challenge Communist Party rule. The most famous of the 54 detainees is Ai Weiwei, an artist and democracy activist.
