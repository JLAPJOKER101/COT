The firm disclosed in a regulatory filing that its halfway finished raising a brand new $50 million round of funding, the second in its two-year history and a significant step up from the $29 million investment that it raised in its first round. 500 Startups also named four new partners  Paul Singh, Christen OBrien, Bedy Yang, and George Kellerman  who will help select and manage the more than 100 investments that the firm makes each year.So we were very happy to have McClure as a guest today on TechCrunch TV. Because of regulatory limitations on what companies can say while theyre in the process of raising funding, his hands were tied on lots of topics on the details of the new fund  but we were still able to get some great details from him on the future direction of 500 Startups and the venture funding world in general. Watch the video above to hear McClures thoughts on what some people call his spray and pray funding strategy, how being a hillbilly from West Virginia originally informs his instincts as an investor, why 500 Startups is so keen on international investments, what sector hes especially excited about right now, and lots more.
