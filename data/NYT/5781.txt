The authorities have arrested Marcial Abaga Barril, an opposition member who planned to campaign against the Nov. 13 referendum on a constitutional change that would all but ensure Africa&rsquo;s longest-serving dictator could extend his rule, Human Rights Watch said Friday. Mr. Barril was arrested outside his home on Tuesday night in what the authorities said was a murder investigation. &ldquo;The allegation that Abaga is connected with a murder simply has no credibility,&rdquo; said Daniel Bekele, Africa director at Human Rights Watch. The proposed constitutional changes would allow President Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, who has ruled the oil-rich country for 32 years, to run for two more seven-year terms and create a new post of vice president, which his son Teodorin Obiang Mangue, vice president of the ruling party, would most likely fill.
