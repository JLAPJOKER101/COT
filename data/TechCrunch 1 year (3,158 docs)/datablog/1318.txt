Though its far and away the best iteration of Android to date, 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich has only made its way to a very small percentage of the Android population. I mean, were talking less than five percent, and thats generous.Luckily, HTC is doing its part to bring the cold creamy goodness of Roboto, facial unlock and a brand new UI to its handsets.First on the list to receive the update are the HTC Sensation and the Sensation XE. The rollout for these phones has already started, and will continue over the next few weeks. After that, the Sensation 4G from T-Mobile and the Sensation XL will get their invites to the Ice Cream Sandwich social.Heres HTCs official word:Weâ€™re in the early stages of rolling out Android 4.0 for the HTC Sensation and HTC Sensation XE and upgrades will be more widely available in the next few weeks. The update for the HTC Sensation 4G and HTC Sensation XL will follow. Please note, once we start pushing out updates it will take time for all carriers in each country to get the update. We are working closely with our carrier partners to nail down update schedules for our other smartphones and will have more to share very soon.The Taiwanese phone maker also outlined the rest of the handsets that are approved for Ice Cream Sandwich, a full list of which can be found here.
