Yemen&rsquo;s mainstream opposition coalition said Tuesday it would set up a &ldquo;National Council for the Forces of the Revolution&rdquo; to lead efforts to oust President Ali Abdullah Saleh and end months of violence. The Joint Meeting Parties made the decision just days after youth groups and activists who have been at the forefront of six months of pro-democracy protests formed their own 17-member &ldquo;transitional council&rdquo; in a bid to force out Mr. Saleh.
