Talks between Georgia and Russia on Russia&rsquo;s accession to the World Trade Organization ended with no agreement on Thursday, and little time remains if Russia is to join the organization by the end of the year. The two sides are to meet again on Tuesday, said Deputy Foreign Minister Sergi Kapanadze, who headed Georgia&rsquo;s delegation to the talks in Switzerland. He said the discussions were stymied by Georgia&rsquo;s request for information on trade through Abkhazia and South Ossetia, breakaway territories of Georgia that Russia has recognized as sovereign countries. American and Russian officials have said they hope to complete the accession process by the end of the year, which would require Georgia&rsquo;s approval by mid-November.
