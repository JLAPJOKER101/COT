An anonymous group of former and current French diplomats said Tuesday that President Nicolas Sarkozy&rsquo;s approach to foreign policy was plagued by amateurism, impulsiveness and a preoccupation with media attention. The criticisms, in an opinion article in the influential newspaper Le Monde, followed a string of diplomatic embarrassments for France, many involving Tunisia. &ldquo;Contrary to the announcements trumpeted for the past three years, Europe is powerless, Africa escapes us, the Mediterranean won&rsquo;t talk to us, China has kept us down and Washington is ignoring us!&rdquo; the authors said, adding that Mr. Sarkozy was quick to blame career diplomats for the &ldquo;disappointments&rdquo; of policies decided &ldquo;at the presidency of the Republic without taking into account the analyses of our embassies.&rdquo;        

The government has been criticized for its initial reticence to condemn the violent repression of Tunisian protesters and for offering Tunisia&rsquo;s government at the time help in training its riot police officers. Mr. Sarkozy later said his government had underestimated the anger in Tunisia, a former French protectorate, and he replaced the ambassador there. His government has also been hurt by revelations that Foreign Minister Mich&egrave;le Alliot-Marie vacationed in Tunisia during antigovernment protests and accepted two free flights from a businessman close to the family of Tunisia&rsquo;s president, who was later ousted.        

Le Monde rarely publishes an op-ed article by writers it does not name. The newspaper  is considered center-left, while Mr. Sarkozy and his party are center-right.
