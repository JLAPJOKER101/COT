Sigh. Here we go again. A patent troll called Mount Hamilton Partners has filed two separate patent infringement lawsuits against daily deals juggernaut Groupon and Google, which also operates a digital couponing business called Google Offers.Mount Hamilton Partners, which purports to be an investor in technology companies on its website, garnered headlines about two and a half years ago when it sued OpenTable right before the restaurant reservation service provider went public. Now theyre going after Google and Groupon.The patent in both cases is U.S. patent 7,904,334, entitled “System and method for reducing excess capacity for restaurants and other industries during off-peak or.”In the filings, Mount Hamilton Partners argues that the fact that services like Groupon and Google Offers help restaurants fill unused seats and build direct relationships  thus increasing loyalty  with individual customers, infringes its patent, causing irreparable harm. The patent in question was filed for in May 2004 and approved earlier this year. As far as I can tell, Mount Hamilton has never produced or sold any innovations based on its patented technology.Both suits seek damages. Both suits should have never been filed.
