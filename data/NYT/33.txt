MOSCOW (AP) &mdash; Russia&rsquo;s transport oversight agency on Sunday ordered the country&rsquo;s airlines to stop using Tu-154B aircraft until the cause of a passenger jet fire and explosion that killed three people was determined.        

The state news agency RIA Novosti said 14 Tu-154Bs are in service in Russia.        

No cause has been determined for Saturday&rsquo;s fire, which also injured 43 people. The fire began as the plane carrying 124 people taxied for takeoff at the airport in Surgut in western Siberia.
