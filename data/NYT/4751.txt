A persistent drought in China has left more than 14 million people short of drinking water and damaged large tracts of farmland, according to a report on Friday by Xinhua, the state news agency. The drought is concentrated in the southwest, where 12.6 million people are short of water. The drought began in early July and has caused reservoirs and rivers to dry up. The areas hardest hit are Yunnan and Guizhou Provinces, the Guangxi Autonomous Region and the dense municipality of Chongqing. About 14 million acres of farmland across China have been affected, Xinhua reported. This drought and others that have devastated southern China this year have raised questions about the wisdom of a giant and expensive government project to transfer water from rivers in the south, in particular the Yangtze, to the parched north.
