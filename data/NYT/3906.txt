The United States-led coalition said Friday that more than 50 insurgents were killed in a military operation at a foreign fighters&rsquo; encampment in eastern Afghanistan. The coalition said that after getting tips about the camp, coalition troops, including Afghan special forces, battled heavily armed insurgents Thursday night and into Friday. NATO said the camp, in the Sar Rawza district of Paktika Province, was a staging area for foreign militants and members of Haqqani, an insurgent network affiliated with the Taliban and Al Qaeda.
