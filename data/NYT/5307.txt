The European Union welcomed a newly formed Syrian opposition council on Monday but stopped short of recognizing the body, which is seeking international support for a six-month-old uprising against President Bashar al-Assad. European foreign ministers meeting in Luxembourg called the creation of the Syrian National Council &ldquo;a positive step forward.&rdquo; A member of the council&rsquo;s executive committee said Monday that the group was seeking recognition as representing the Syrian opposition but had no interest in becoming an alternative government. Syria has threatened to retaliate against any government that recognized the council.
