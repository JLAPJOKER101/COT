The Lithuanian Parliament voted Tuesday to pay $53 million in compensation for the seizure of Jewish property by Nazis during World War II. The vote was 87 to 7, with 47 members abstaining or absent. The compensation will be paid from 2013 to 2023 into a special fund for social, cultural, educational and other projects for Lithuanian Jews. The country&rsquo;s Jewish population today numbers about 5,000; before World War II, it was 220,000.
