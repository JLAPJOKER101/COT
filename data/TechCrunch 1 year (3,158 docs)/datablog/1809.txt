Supporters of the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) may be on the run in the face of growing online protests, but SOPA and its Senate counterpart, PIPA, is not dead yet. The fight isnt over, Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian tells me in the TCTV video interview above.Ohanian was scheduled to testify before Congress on Wednesday before that hearing was cancelled. But Reddit, along with Wikipedia and other sites, will observe a self-imposed blackout in protest. In the video above, he explains why Reddit is going ahead with its blackout plans and speaks more broadly against the acts.Just before he showed up to the TCTV studio today, Rupert Murdoch tweeted out:Nonsense argument about danger to Internet.  How about Google, others blocking porn, hate speech, etc?  Internet hurt? Rupert Murdoch  (@rupertmurdoch) January 17, 2012To which Ohanian commented: This shows a serious misunderstanding of how the technology works.In New York City and San Francisco, anti-SOPA protestors (including Ron Conway) will take to the streets and protest outside their Senators offices. I am just here in front of a camera because the whole Internet cannot fit in this room, says Ohanian. It has become an election issue.Read our full coverage of SOPA here.
