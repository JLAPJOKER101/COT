After a long vacation, TechCrunch Cribs is back! But as TechCrunch alum Jason Kincaid left us with some pretty big shoes to fill, for our first installment we decided to start with a company that knows the Cribs drill already  enterprise cloud storage company Box. It was just eight months ago that Box last got the Cribs treatment, but lots has changed since then: Its employee count has doubled in size to a staff of 400, they dropped the .net from their name, and they moved into a bigger and better new headquarters in Los Altos, California. Watch the video above to see Box CEO Aaron Levie and enterprise general manager Whitney Tidmarsh Bouck give us a tour of all three floors of Boxs new office: We took the elevator and steps up, the slide back down, and a scooter all the way back home.
