A police commander and seven officers have been arrested in the killing of a judge. The Rio de Janeiro State police said that six of the officers were detained Tuesday; the other two were arrested earlier. The judge, Patr&iacute;cia Acioli, who was known for being tough on rogue police officers who turned to vigilantism and extorted money, was shot in August outside her house in Niter&oacute;i.
