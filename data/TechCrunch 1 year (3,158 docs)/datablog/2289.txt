Dearest Jimmy Wales,So we meet again Wales  Yes I know, another holiday season, another reason to poke fun at your silly, scopophobia-inducing banner ads belying the very noble cause of raising $29.5 million for an unlimited supply of constantly updated knowledge  FOR WHICH WE ARE ALL VERY THANKFUL JIMMY, I PROMISE.But, for whatever reason Jimmy, this year youve chosen to left align your traditional banner ad portrait asking for Wikimedia Foundation donations, which means that your mug ends up being the accompanying image for whatever I end up looking up on Wikipedia.And thus hilarity ensues (See above, and below and below and below and well you get the picture).My  granted unsolicited  advice is that next year you take some of the donation money, especially the 20 bucks Im about to throw at you out of guilt for writing this post, and hire a professional graphic designer so youre not creeping people out or (worse) making them laugh unintentionally.Best (and Happy Holidays!),Alexia TsotsisSuggestion for @jimmy_wales: consider right-aligning your headshot in the "personal appeal" banner: http://t.co/49e2vaL8 Gabe Rivera (@gaberivera) November 12, 2011I find it very unsettling to see that photo of Jimmy Wales at the top of Wikipedia. I keep thinking I'm in the wrong entry. Gretchen Rubin (@gretchenrubin) November 18, 2011Why does every single person you look up on Wikipedia resemble Jimmy Wales?  (@geneweingarten) November 20, 2011Each time I go to Wikipedia, I see a photo of Jimmy Wales. It's as if he's watching over all of us  en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Be… it's the wikiopticon Andrew Keen (@ajkeen) November 21, 2011Sometimes, when I go to Wikipedia, I think I've actually accidentally stumbled onto Jimmy Wales's Facebook page.
