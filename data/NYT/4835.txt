As the firefight in Kabul, Afghanistan, simmered down early on Wednesday, the battle on Twitter began heating up, with representatives of the NATO-led coalition and the Taliban trading barbs in a burst of virtual conversation.        

Written in the slashing jargon of the short messaging service, the Twitter exchange underscored a continuing effort by the United States and NATO to portray as unsuccessful the brazen attack on the American Embassy and the headquarters of the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force.        

&ldquo;Re: Taliban spox on #Kabul attack: the outcome is inevitable,&rdquo; read a message on a Twitter account managed by the NATO forces, and using an abbreviation for spokesman. &ldquo;Question is how much longer will terrorist put innocent Afghans in harm&rsquo;s way?&rdquo;        

To this, a Taliban representative, who identified himself as Abdulqahar Balkhi and wrote under the handle @abalkhi, replied in garbled shorthand: &ldquo;i dnt knw.u hve bn pttng thm n &lsquo;harm&rsquo;s way&rsquo; fr da pst 10 yrs.Razd whole vllgs n mrkts.n stil hv da nrve to tlk bout &lsquo;harm&rsquo;s way&rsquo;.&rdquo;        

(The message, in plain English, would be: I don&rsquo;t know. You have been putting them in &lsquo;harm&rsquo;s way&rsquo; for the past 10 years. Razed whole villages and markets. And still have the nerve to talk about &lsquo;harm&rsquo;s way?&rsquo;)        

&ldquo;Really, @abalkhi?&rdquo; NATO responded, citing a United Nations finding that insurgents were responsible for 80 percent of the civilian casualties in Afghanistan in the first six months of 2011.        

&ldquo;UNAMA is an entity of whom? mine or yours?&rdquo; came the Taliban response, using the acronym for the United Nations mission in Afghanistan.        

A NATO spokesman in Kabul said the exchange was part of a stepped-up campaign to fight what it perceives as misinformation on social networks. &ldquo;This past week, we started engaging a little bit more,&rdquo; said the spokesman, Lt. Col. Jimmie E. Cummings Jr.
