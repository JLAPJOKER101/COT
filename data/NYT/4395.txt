Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin pledged help and cash for 13 million disabled Russians on Friday, seeking to broaden support for his new movement ahead of December&rsquo;s parliamentary elections. Russia signed the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in 2008, but its cities provide little access for people with disabilities to transportation, public buildings, schools, medical facilities and workplaces. Mr. Putin said all administrative buildings in Russia would soon be equipped with wheelchair ramps and elevators. He said Russia had budgeted $1.8 billion through 2015 to create an accessible environment in cities.
