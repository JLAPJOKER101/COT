The number of reported victims of a mass rape by gunmen in Congo has risen to as many as 170, the United Nations&rsquo; refugee agency said Friday. The government in Kinshasa said that the mass rape, the largest reported in nearly a year, might have been carried out by former rebels whom the government had been trying to integrate into the army. A spokeswoman for the agency, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, said about 170 women had been raped in the villages of Nakiele and Abala in South Kivu Province on June 11.
