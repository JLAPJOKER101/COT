My set ritual before going to bed each night is as follows  turn out the lights, plug in my iPhone, take off my glasses and attempt vainly to nod off. Step two in that process can be a bit of a crapshoot in the dark, but the folks at Scrap Pile Labs have recently kicked off a new Kickstarter campaign for a product called the CordLite that just may come in handy.As the name sort of implies, the CordLite is a dock connector cable for iDevices that, well, lights up thanks to a pair of forward-facing LEDs. Its a very simple concept, but the thoughtful execution is what make this project worth keeping an eye on.Perhaps the niftiest thing about the CordLite is how you actually fire up those lights  the dock connectors aluminum body is entirely touch-sensitive, so the lights engage whenever someone goes to plug in the cable. Meanwhile, a pair of indicator lights run along the top of the dock connector so theres never any confusion as to which side is up.Pledging $25 locks you in for one of the first CordLites to roll off of the assembly line, so youd best shell out the dough if youre interested  after the Kickstarter campaign ends, the price will jump up to $35. Not a bad deal for night owls, especially considering that Apples own dock connector cable is nearly $20 without a single frill to go with it.Though the CordLite is Apple-only for now, Android users shouldnt feel too left out. The team also has a light-up micro-USB cable in the works, though I suspect we wont be seeing those out in the wild for a little while yet.
