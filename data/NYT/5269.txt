The government said Friday that it would move to classify high-potency marijuana alongside hard drugs like cocaine and ecstasy, the latest step in a continuing reversal of the country&rsquo;s famed tolerance policies. Economic Affairs Minister Maxime Verhagen said marijuana containing more than 15 percent THC, its main active chemical, is so much stronger than what was common a generation ago that it should be considered a different drug. The decision means most of the marijuana now sold in designated cafes would have to be replaced by milder variants. Critics said it would encourage users to smoke larger amounts of the milder drug, causing greater health damage.
