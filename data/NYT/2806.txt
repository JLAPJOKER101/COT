PESHAWAR, Pakistan (AP) &mdash; A suicide car bomber blew up a police building here early Wednesday, officials said, killing two people and wounding at least 22 in the latest attack since the United States raid that killed Osama bin Laden.        

Though no group immediately claimed responsibility, the attack adds to fears that it will be a bloody summer as the Pakistani Taliban and other groups affiliated with Al Qaeda carry out threats to avenge Bin Laden&rsquo;s death. The Pakistani Taliban says it has carried out three revenge attacks, including a deadly 18-hour siege of a naval base in Karachi this week.        

The target on Wednesday appeared to be a police building, but Pakistani Army facilities also are nearby, said Liaquat Ali Khan, a senior police official here.        

Four of the wounded were in serious condition. A handful of others were said to be missing, possibly in the rubble of the building, which collapsed after the explosion.        

&ldquo;Our determination is much higher than before, and we will fight till the defeat of these terrorists,&rdquo; said Bashir Bilour, a senior government official.        

Bin Laden was killed on May 2 by a Navy Seal team in the army town of Abbottabad. Since the Bin Laden raid, the Pakistani Taliban have taken responsibility for a twin suicide bombing at a paramilitary police training center that killed about 90 people and a car bomb that slightly wounded two Americans.        

But it is the siege of the Karachi naval base, which began Sunday and ended the next day, that has most rattled the Pakistani military. The fact that the attackers managed to infiltrate so deep into the high-security base led to speculation that they may have had inside information or assistance. The military is not immune from anti-Americanism, especially in its lower ranks.
