Three people were killed and dozens injured during antigovernment clashes in Tirana, the capital, on Friday. More than 20,000 protesters were marching to demand early elections after the deputy prime minister resigned in a corruption scandal. The scandal broke after a private TV station broadcast a video that appeared to show Deputy Prime Minister Ilir Meta,  above, asking a colleague to influence the awarding of a contract to build a power station. Prime Minister Sali Berisha accused the opposition Socialists, who called the protest, of trying to overthrow the government with a &ldquo;Tunisian style&rdquo; demonstration.
