The army said Thursday that it had detained a man whom the United States considers one of the most-wanted drug traffickers from Mexico. Mexican authorities describe the man, Ovidio Lim&oacute;n S&aacute;nchez, as a leader of the Sinaloa drug cartel, one of the largest and most powerful in Mexico. The United States, which accuses him of sending cocaine across the border, had offered a reward of up to $5 million for his capture. He was arrested Wednesday in the city of Culiac&aacute;n and is expected to face extradition to the United States.
