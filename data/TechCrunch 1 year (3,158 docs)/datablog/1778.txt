Next week a class-action civil lawsuit will be heard in San Jose to determine if Google, Apple, Pixar, Lucasfilm, Adobe, Intel, and Intuit conspired to eliminate competition for skilled labor. In anticipation of the hearing, TechCrunch has obtained evidence from the Department of Justices investigation in 2010 which was made public this evening for the first time. It appears to support the plaintiffs case that the defendant companies tried to suppress employee compensation by entering into no poach agreements.Previously, only the DOJ was privy to the evidence, so there was no way for the public to know whether the settlement came out the defendants fear they would lose. Now we know the C-level management at these companies did enter into anti-competitive agreements.Below you can see the redacted Exhibit Joint Case Management Conference Statement attained from Pacer.org. Filed today, it contains evidence from the DOJ investigation pertinent to the upcoming civil case.
