Countries that vaccinate babies against rotavirus, which can cause severe diarrhea and kill in days, have significantly reduced the number of children admitted to hospitals with the disease, a report showed Thursday. Data from the United States, Australia, Mexico and El Salvador, where rotavirus vaccines have recently become part of routine childhood immunizations, show steep and swift declines in the number of children under 5 who become ill with the virus, according to studies published in a supplement to The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal. The studies also show large reductions in rotavirus disease among older, unvaccinated children, suggesting that vaccination of babies may also limit the overall amount of virus transmission in what is known as herd immunity. Rotavirus-related diarrhea kills more than 500,000 children a year and sends millions more to the hospital. Dr. John Wecker, director of the global vaccine access and delivery program at the nonprofit organization PATH, said the findings should compel policy makers and international donors to support the introduction of rotavirus vaccines in all countries as soon as possible.
