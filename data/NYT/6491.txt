Gay and transgender people in all regions face discrimination and violence, including killings, rape and torture because of their orientation, and risk the death penalty in at least five countries, the United Nations said Thursday. In its first official report on the issue, the United Nations said that in addition to spontaneous &ldquo;street&rdquo; violence, people perceived as being members of a sexual minority may be targets of organized abuse, &ldquo;including by religious extremists, paramilitary groups, neo-Nazis and extreme nationalists.&rdquo; The attacks tend to be especially vicious, with &ldquo;a high degree of cruelty,&rdquo; including mutilation and castration, it added. Currently, 76 countries have laws that criminalize behavior on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity, the report said. The report by the High Commissioner for Human Rights, Navi Pillay, called on governments to protect lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, prosecute all serious violations and repeal discriminatory laws.
