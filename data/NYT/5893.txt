A Palestinian bid to win full membership in the United Nations came one step closer to collapse on Friday when a Security Council committee failed to reach agreement on the issue. The development left it up to Palestinians, who have been unable to secure the nine votes needed to pass a Security Council resolution favoring their bid, to decide whether to call a vote on their application. That would be a symbolic move because the United States has vowed to veto the application. The United Nations now considers Palestine an observer &ldquo;entity.&rdquo; President Mahmoud Abbas, above, applied on Sept. 23 for full United Nations membership for a Palestinian state. A report adopted on Friday by the Security Council&rsquo;s admissions committee, which includes all 15 council members, said the body was &ldquo;unable to make a unanimous recommendation to the Security Council.&rdquo;
