SaneBox is definitely starting to get my attention. The company, which is focused on solving the very real problem of email overload, has just rolled out a minor, but clever, new feature: reminders that sync to calendars. With the so-called SaneRemindMe 2.0 offering, you can quickly defer emails until youre ready to deal with them. Its essentially a snooze button for your email. Starting now, those reminders dont just bump up emails in your inbox at the appropriate times, they can also sync to your calendar.Heres how the feature works, if youre unfamiliar. When you get an email that you want to defer to a later date, you send it to an email address specifying that date or time. The email address can be very specific, like October15@sanebox.com or more general, like 30minutes@sanebox.com or 1week@sanebox.com, for example. If you later reply to the email in question, no reminder is ever sent. But if you dont reply (as is typically the case), SaneBox forwards the email back to the top of your inbox at the time specified.The feature can also be used on emails you send out  just cc: or bcc: the @sanebox.com email address to remind yourself to follow up later with the recipient if they dont reply.That part (above) isnt new  it was previously available in the initial SaneBox offering. What is new is that the feature will now also sync up the reminders with your preferred calendar service, like Google Calendar or iCal, for example.Hmm, reminders that are integrated into email, work via forwarding, and automatically sync with other products in your office productivity suite? And why is it that weve had to wait for a third-party to develop this technology, again? Well, thanks, SaneBox.If youre interested in trying it out, SaneBox works with almost any email service, including Gmail, Yahoo, AOL, Apple, Outlook and others.Fine, Im signing up.
