Just two weeks after Verizons 4G data network most recently went on the fritz, it looks like customers are once again being forced to live their lives without data. Scores of Verizon users across the country will be waking up without without so much as a 3G connection in sight until a fix is in place.A quick look at Verizons support forums illustrates the extent of the data outage: the data outage has struck New York, California, Illinois, Washington D.C., New Jersey, Florida, North Carolina, and Ohio (among others).Now the outage doesnt seem to be affecting everyone (much like last time), and some users are reporting that their data service has been restored. Id take those reports with a grain of salt for the time being: my Verizon Galaxy Nexus manages to pick up a 1X or 3G connection sporadically, but it never lasts for long. That said, anyone who has an LTE smartphone may want to switch into the CDMA-only mode, as thats where Ive had most of my (limited) success with data.While Im sure that it wont be too long before Verizon sorts out this mess, it may not be the most comforting situation for customers looking to re-up their contracts with Big Red. Theyve had pretty consistent 4G service for the year that the network has been live, but now customers have had to deal with two major data snafus in one month. Cmon Verizon, I expect these sorts of data issues from RIM, not you.Verizon has yet to acknowledge the issue via a release, although their @VZWSupport Twitter account has just started fielding customer complaints about the outage. Well keep you posted on any further developments.UPDATE: Its all over, folks. Back to web surfing and tweeting as usual.Data service restored for all 4G customers after issue in AM. 3G devices were unaffected.  Voice, text worked for all customers throughout.
