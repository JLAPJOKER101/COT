Gunfire broke out early Friday between Thai and Cambodian troops along the border, security officials said. One Thai soldier was killed in the fighting, the Thai military said. The clashes were the first between Thailand and Cambodia since four days of artillery duels and gunfire in February at the Preah Vihear temple. The skirmishes took place Friday about 150 miles west of the temple, said a Cambodian Defense Ministry spokesman, Lt. Gen Chhum Socheat.
