Four elderly Kenyans who claim they were tortured during an anticolonial rebellion in the 1950s can sue the British government, a judge ruled Thursday. The Kenyans say they were beaten and sexually assaulted by officers acting for the British administration who were trying to suppress the so-called Mau Mau rebellion, in which groups of Kenyans attacked British officials and white farmers who had settled in some of Kenya&rsquo;s most fertile lands. The British government tried to have the case thrown out, saying it could not be held legally responsible for the abuses. But a High Court judge, Richard McCombe, ruled that the claimants &ldquo;have arguable cases in law.&rdquo; President Obama&rsquo;s grandfather, Hussein Onyango Obama, was one of thousands of Kenyans detained.
