Britain is having an unusual surge of flu cases this winter, according to the World Health Organization, and British news media reports said severe cases were straining intensive care units, particularly those for children, at some hospitals. Most cases are of last year&rsquo;s H1N1 swine flu pandemic strain, which has now become a seasonal flu. Relatively few Britons got flu shots this year, officials said, ascribing that to skepticism after the swine flu pandemic proved less lethal than feared.
