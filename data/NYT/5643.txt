State television reported Thursday that Prince Nayef bin Abdul Aziz, the tough-talking interior minister, had been named heir to the Saudi throne after the death of the Crown Prince Sultan last week. Prince Nayef, 78, has led crackdowns on Islamic militants but has also supported conservative traditions, like maintaining the ban on women voting. He was also named vice prime minister and will keep his job as interior minister. He would assume the throne upon the death of King Abdullah, 87, who is recovering from his third operation to treat back problems in less than a year.
