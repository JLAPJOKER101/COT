MAIDUGURI, Nigeria (AP) &mdash; Witnesses and Nigerian authorities said Sunday that at least four people were killed in an attack on a northeastern city that left churches and businesses burned to the ground.        

The attack happened Saturday night in the city of Geidam in Yobe State, which sits near the country&rsquo;s arid border with Niger.        

Witnesses said a group of attackers blew up a police station and set fire to businesses and at least eight churches.        

On Nov. 4, an attack in the state capital claimed by the radical Islamic sect known as Boko Haram killed more than 100 people.        

On Sunday, the police said the sect was responsible for two killings in neighboring Borno State.
