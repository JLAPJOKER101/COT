ISTANBUL &mdash; A 5.6-magnitude earthquake on Wednesday in the same region hit by a larger quake two weeks ago killed at least three people and trapped others who had moved into damaged buildings that collapsed Wednesday, the Turkish media reported.        

The reports said about 25 buildings, including two hotels, were destroyed Wednesday. Many of the buildings were empty, according to a television report on NTV, but some people had moved into the hotels after their homes were flattened or deemed unsafe after the earlier 7.2-magnitude quake.        

News reports said dozens of people might be trapped in the rubble.        

By early Thursday morning, rescue teams rescued eight people from the debris of the Bayram Hotel, where many journalists covering the aftermath of the earlier quake were staying, the semiofficial Anatolian Agency said.        

Residents of Van, the city hardest hit by the larger quake, and people in neighboring towns had been warned not to enter damaged buildings. Despite the warnings, some people have returned home or slept in other buildings because the temperature has been falling and was about 27 degrees on Wednesday night.        

The earlier quake, which struck on Oct. 23, left about 3,700 buildings uninhabitable, according to the government&rsquo;s disaster relief center in Ankara, the capital. Poor construction was blamed for the scope of the disaster, in which about 600 people died.        

Dogan Kalafat, the director of the Turkish Seismic Institution, said that properly constructed, nondamaged buildings would not be expected to collapse after a moderate quake like the one that struck on Wednesday.
