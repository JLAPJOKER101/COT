Uighur advocacy groups have criticized the recent death sentences of four men who are all apparently ethnic Uighurs.  The men were reportedly sentenced for three separate incidents of  violence last year. They are Turhun Turdi, Abdulla Tunyaz, Ahunniyaz  Nur, and Abdukerim Abdurahman. The report of the sentencing first  appeared on Wednesday in Xinjiang Daily, an official newspaper published  out of Urumqi,  the capital of Xinjiang, a vast region in western China where Uighurs,  the largest ethnic group there, chafe against policies set by the ethnic  Han, who rule China.        

Two of the men were convicted in connection with an explosion that killed at least seven people last year in Aksu. &ldquo;By  sentencing these four Uighurs to death, China is attempting to  intimidate the Uighur people, fearing that they will take to the streets  to demand human rights, democracy and freedoms from the authoritarian  Chinese government,&rdquo; Rebiya Kadeer, a leader of Uighur exiles, said in a written statement late Wednesday.
