A bullet struck a window of the building in Kabul where the European Union&rsquo;s ambassador to Afghanistan, Vygaudas Usackas, was working Tuesday. No one was injured, and although the bullet left a mark, it did not penetrate the window. European Union officials said they were not sure if the shot was intentional. An investigation is under way, according to a statement from a spokeswoman for the European Union that said the window was bulletproof.
