Russia accused France on Thursday of committing a &ldquo;crude violation&rdquo; of a United Nations weapons embargo by arming Libyan rebels. France confirmed Wednesday that it had air-dropped arms to rebels in the Misurata and the Nafusah Mountains, becoming the first NATO country to publicly acknowledge arming the insurgency. Foreign Minister Sergey V. Lavrov of Russia said that if the reports were true, &ldquo;it is a very crude violation of U.N. Security Council Resolution 1970,&rdquo; the resolution imposing a comprehensive arms embargo on Libya. France said Wednesday that the weapons did not violate the embargo because they were intended to protect civilians from attack, which it said was allowed under a later resolution allowing &ldquo;all necessary measures&rdquo; to protect civilians. The United States agreed. A State Department spokesman, Mark Toner, said the two resolutions, &ldquo;read together, neither specified nor precluded providing defense mat&eacute;riel to the Libyan opposition.&rdquo; He added that it was &ldquo;not an option that we have acted on.&rdquo;
