A Uruguayan military judge ordered five sailors accused of sexually abusing a young Haitian man to be jailed until a tribunal decides whether to dishonorably discharge them, a spokeswoman said Monday. The sailors, who were serving as United Nations peacekeepers, returned home from Haiti on Friday. Uruguay&rsquo;s civilian courts are also investigating the accusations, and President Jos&eacute; Mujica of Uruguay has said the men will face the most severe penalties if convicted.
