WASHINGTON &mdash; The guns in Libya have barely quieted, and NATO&rsquo;s military assistance to the rebellion that toppled Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi will not end officially until Monday. But a new invasion force is already plotting its own landing on the shores of Tripoli.        

Western security, construction and infrastructure companies that see profit-making opportunities receding in Iraq and Afghanistan have turned their sights on Libya, now free of four decades of dictatorship. Entrepreneurs are abuzz about the business potential of a country with huge needs and the oil to pay for them, plus the competitive advantage of Libyan gratitude toward the United States and its NATO partners.        

A week before Colonel Qaddafi&rsquo;s death on Oct. 20, a delegation from 80 French companies arrived in Tripoli to meet officials of the Transitional National Council, the interim government. Last week, the new British defense minister, Philip Hammond, urged British companies to &ldquo;pack their suitcases&rdquo; and head to Tripoli.        

When Colonel Qaddafi&rsquo;s body was still on public display, a British venture, Trango Special Projects, pitched its support services to companies looking to cash in. &ldquo;Whilst speculation continues regarding Qaddafi&rsquo;s killing,&rdquo; Trango said on its Web site, &ldquo;are you and your business ready to return to Libya?&rdquo;        

The company offered rooms at its Tripoli villa and transport &ldquo;by our discreet mixed British and Libyan security team.&rdquo; Its discretion does not come cheaply. The price for a 10-minute ride from the airport, for which the ordinary cab fare is about $5, is listed at 500 British pounds, or about $800.        

&ldquo;There is a gold rush of sorts taking place right now,&rdquo; said David Hamod, president and chief executive officer of the National U.S.-Arab Chamber of Commerce. &ldquo;And the Europeans and Asians are way ahead of us. I&rsquo;m getting calls daily from members of the business community in Libya. They say, &lsquo;Come back, we don&rsquo;t want the Americans to lose out.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;        

Yet there is hesitancy on both sides, and so far the talk greatly exceeds the action. The Transitional National Council, hoping to avoid any echo of the rank corruption of the Qaddafi era, has said no long-term contracts will be signed until an elected government is in place. And with cities still bristling with arms and jobless young men, Libya does not offer anything like a safe business environment &mdash; hence the pitches from security providers.        

Like France and Britain, the United States may benefit from the Libyan authorities&rsquo; appreciation of NATO&rsquo;s critical air support for the revolution. Whatever the rigor of new rules governing contracts, Western companies hope to have some advantage over, say, China, which was offering to sell arms to Colonel Qaddafi as recently as July.        

&ldquo;Revenge may be too strong a word,&rdquo; said Phil Dwyer, director of SCN Resources Group, a Virginia contracting company that opened an office in Tripoli two weeks ago to offer &ldquo;risk management&rdquo; advice and services to a company he would not name. &ldquo;But my feeling is those who are in favor&rdquo; with the transitional council &ldquo;are going to get the nod from a business point of view.&rdquo;        

The Security Contracting Network, a job service run by Mr. Dwyer&rsquo;s company, posted on its blog two days after Colonel Qaddafi&rsquo;s death that there would be plenty of work opening up in Libya.        

&ldquo;There will be an uptick of activity as foreign oil companies scramble to get back to Libya,&rdquo; the company said, along with a need for logistics and security personnel as the State Department and nonprofit organizations expand operations. &ldquo;Keep an eye on who wins related contracts, follow the money, and find your next job,&rdquo; the post advised.        

In Tripoli, there is a wait-and-see atmosphere. At breakfast on Friday in a downtown hotel, a British security contractor pointed out the tables of burly men &mdash; hired guns like himself. &ldquo;Look at it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Full of &rsquo;em.&rdquo;
