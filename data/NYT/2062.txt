A Jehovah&rsquo;s Witness charged in connection with distributing religious literature was found not guilty of &ldquo;inciting religious hatred and enmity&rdquo; on Thursday after a six-month trial in the Siberian city of Gorno-Altaisk. The defendant, Aleksandr Kalistratov, said he hoped the verdict &ldquo;will be useful for my fellow believers, who continue to be persecuted in Russia.&rdquo; Nearly a dozen other cases are being pursued against Jehovah&rsquo;s Witnesses in Russia.
