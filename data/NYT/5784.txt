An American soldier died in an attack in Iraq, the military said Friday in the first report of a combat fatality since President Obama announced last month that all United States troops would leave the country by the end of the year. An Iraqi security service official said the soldier died from a grenade thrown at his convoy in Kirkuk, north of Baghdad, on Thursday. Two other Americans have died in noncombat accidents since Mr. Obama&rsquo;s Oct. 21 announcement; the last combat fatality had been on Sept. 29.
