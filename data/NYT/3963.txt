An Istanbul court sentenced a man to almost 23 years in jail on Monday for the killing of an ethnic Armenian journalist who criticized nationalist tendencies in Turkey. The man, Ogun Samast, an ultranationalist, shot the journalist, Hrant Dink, in January 2007. The death of Mr. Dink, the editor of the only Turkish-Armenian bilingual newspaper in Turkey, led to public discussions about the way Armenians are treated.
