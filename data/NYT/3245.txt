A media storm over corrupt officials is embarrassing China&rsquo;s Communist Party as it prepares to celebrate its 90th birthday on July 1. The news coverage has focused on a study circulating on the Internet claiming that corrupt officials have fled the country with more than $100 billion since the mid-1990s, mainly to the United States. It is unclear who wrote the 71-page study, which is marked &ldquo;internal material&rdquo; but has no author, letterhead or other identifying features. It was reported to have been posted on the Web site of the People&rsquo;s Bank of China. It remains online, but not on the bank&rsquo;s Web site.
