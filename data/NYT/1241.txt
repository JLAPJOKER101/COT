ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (Reuters) &mdash; At least 3 people were killed and 30 wounded in an attack on a village viewed as loyal to the strongman Laurent Gbagbo, his Interior Ministry said in a statement on Monday.        

The attack took place overnight in Anokoua-Koute, the ministry said, an area populated by the largely pro-Gbagbo Ebrie tribe. The village is within an Abidjan suburb controlled by insurgents who support Mr. Gbagbo&rsquo;s rival, Alassane Ouattara. The attack was confirmed separately by two witnesses. Officials of the movement supporting Mr. Ouattara, who won a presidential election according to most of the international community, were not available for comment.        

&ldquo;Overnight, the village of Anokoua-Koute was attacked by the rebels,&rdquo; said an Interior Ministry spokesman, Abdoulaye Traore.
