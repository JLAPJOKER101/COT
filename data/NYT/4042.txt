The Pakistani Taliban have custody of two kidnapped Swiss tourists and will free them if the United States releases a Pakistani woman convicted of trying to kill Americans, a commander of the group said. The tourists, who have not been identified, were abducted in the southwestern Baluchistan Province this month and later taken to South Waziristan, a base of the Pakistani Taliban, the authorities said. The commander, Waliur Rehman, said Thursday that his group had ordered the kidnapping to try to gain the freedom of Aafia Siddiqui, an American-educated neuroscientist serving an 86-year prison term for trying to shoot United States security officials in Afghanistan.
