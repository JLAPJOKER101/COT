Heres Samsungs official word on the matter:Samsung Smart TV will become the first TV to offer the worlds most popular game and set a new standard in the industry by offering a game for Smart TVs controlled by hand gestures. Samsung will continue to develop various content that bring family members together in front of the TV, allowing consumers to enjoy new experiences via Samsung Smart TVs.And just look at these little kids having fun:Oddly enough, this isnt the first time that Angry Birds has been available for play on a big screen. Rokus second line of streamers offers motion-controlled Angry Birds madness, however you need the remote to get your game on there. In Samsungs case, the app is already built in to the TV and all you need are your glorious, bird-flinging hands. Samsung Smart TVs start around $3,000. Angry Birds costs $1.00 for the full version.
