Attention teens and the adults that act like them: Facebook has added emoticons to Chat on the web. While before you could use text like   to create a smile or even :putnam: to show a picture of an early Facebook engineer, now theres a little menu of the most common emoticons in the bottom right of any chat window. Just click one to add it to your current instant message. Facebook even made a thumbs up emoticon for its Like Button.Before you laugh and say this isnt news, remember that Facebook Chat connects 900 million+ people across the world. Emoticons can help us all overcome language barriers and communicate, even if just basically, with people we couldnt speak to. And Facebook hopes to allow kids under age 13 onto the service eventually, and having emoticons could make the social network seem like its not just for adults.Right now theres only 21 emoticons in the menu, including the standard frown and wink, as well as a heart, devil, and the Like icon. Click one, and the text code for it will be added to your chat. You can still use emoticons like :-* to show a kiss even though its not in the menu, and yes, you can still use any celebrity or friends face by putting their name in double brackets. Try [[Zuck]] to send the face of Facebooks fearless leader.Theres currently no emoticon menu in the formal Messages part of the site, even though its connected to chat. Theres also no emoticon menus in the mobile apps, and if you send someone on mobile one from the web, it will just appear as a text code instead of a real emoticon. For example the Like-moticon just appears as its code (y) when sent to mobile.This all might seem childish but some of the smartest people I know including big tech company founders frequently use emoticons when they text message. We need to stop judging, feeling guilty, or fearing theyre the death of literature. We make the rules now. All forms of communication are appropriate in the right time and place. So   on!
