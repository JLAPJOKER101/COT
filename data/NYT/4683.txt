Authorities in Trinidad and Tobago have extended a state of emergency by three months, citing continued security concerns since the measure was imposed last month to dismantle gangs. Prime Minister Kamla Persad-Bissessar said the decree averted &ldquo;a criminal uprising of untold proportions.&rdquo; Another official said the government was prepared for any &ldquo;backlash&rdquo; as a result of the extension. The state of emergency includes an 11 p.m.-to-4 a.m. curfew and gives security forces enhanced powers to search suspects and seize property without a warrant.
