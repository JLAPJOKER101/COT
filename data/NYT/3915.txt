A commander of Iran&rsquo;s Revolutionary Guards was killed in an explosion during clashes with Kurdish rebels in northwestern Iran, the Guards said in a statement on Friday. It identified the victim as Gen. Abbas Asemi, a commander in Qom Province, southwest of Tehran. It said a car blew up in northwestern Iran, but did not say when the attack took place. The rebels were from PJAK, the Free Life Party of Kurdistan, an Iranian offshoot of the Kurdistan Workers Party that took up arms in 1984 to fight for the creation of an ethnic homeland in southeast Turkey. Both Iran and the United States have called PJAK a terrorist organization. Iran has pledged to step up military action against the group, which is seeking greater autonomy for Kurdish areas in the country. PJAK has bases in the mountains where the borders of Iran, Iraq and Turkey meet. Iranian forces said Monday that they had seized control of a major PJAK base.
