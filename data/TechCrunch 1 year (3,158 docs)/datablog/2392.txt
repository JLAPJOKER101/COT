A small news item straight from left field, but who knew someone would eventually cough up a six-figure sum for a Libyan domain name (one that ends in .ly)? Well, someone did, and that someone is enterprise applications and services company Infor, which acquired the domain name local.ly for $100,000.The previous owner of local.ly, Hadi Naser of domain name registration and professional services company Libyan Spider, apparently owns several hundred such premium .ly domains. Conveniently, his company also runs a domain name brokerage service at domains.ly.Back in 2010 Libyan Spider sold dai.ly for $17,000 to DailyMotion. Other big .ly domain name sales include song.ly, which fetched a $50,000 price, and Facebook acquired friend.ly about a month ago.The legal and technical advisor on the sellerâ€™s side for the local.ly deal was London-based agency Brands-and-Jingles. You have to wonder how much global.ly is worth.
