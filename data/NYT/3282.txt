A federal judge in Manhattan formally dismissed charges against Osama bin Laden on Friday that were originally brought more than a decade ago. A first indictment, for conspiracy to attack United States defense installations, was filed in 1998 when the authorities were considering a plan to capture and try him in New York. Later indictments charged him in the 1998 bombings of two American Embassies in East Africa. Judge Lewis A. Kaplan ordered the dismissals at the request of federal prosecutors in Manhattan, who filed papers citing proof of Bin Laden&rsquo;s death. Charges remain open against other Qaeda figures, including Ayman al-Zawahri, who has succeeded Bin Laden as the group&rsquo;s leader.
