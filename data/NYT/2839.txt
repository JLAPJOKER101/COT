A businessman nominated to be Haiti&rsquo;s next prime minister said Wednesday that he wanted to scrap the earthquake reconstruction commission, which has been criticized for slow progress. The nominee, Daniel-G&eacute;rard Rouzier, said that the 27-member Interim Haiti Recovery Commission, led by President Bill Clinton, was &ldquo;dysfunctional&rdquo; and would be replaced by a new government agency. Mr. Rouzier said that the commission &ldquo;as it exists today will not continue. I don&rsquo;t mean to crucify the people who came up with the concept. But sometimes when something doesn&rsquo;t work you have to fix it.&rdquo; Mr. Rouzier, who is awaiting Senate confirmation of his nomination, did not provide details of his proposal for a new agency. A spokesman for Mr. Clinton and other commission officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Mr. Rouzier said he hoped that the former American president would continue to be part of the reconstruction effort.
