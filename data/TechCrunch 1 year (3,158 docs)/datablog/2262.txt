Walt Disney Studios and YouTube have struck deal which will bring hundreds of Disney movies to YouTube, starting today. The new partnership between the two companies includes movies from Disney, Disney-Pixar and DreamWorks Studios. The films, some of which have already arrived on YouTube, are available to rent starting at $1.99.Some of todays new releases include Alice in Wonderland, the new Winnie the Pooh, Cars,  Cars 2 and Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides. The older titles are less expensive, it seems. For example, Alice in Wonderland is $1.99 while Pirates is $4.99. The rental allows users up to 30 days to begin watching, but after the video starts, you only have 48 hours of viewing time.Rentals can be watched online, via your Android phone or tablet, or on Google TV.(U.S. and Canada only).Disney is the fourth major studio to partner with YouTube, following Sony, Universal and Warner Brothers. The deal is also the first significant partnership since the rental stores relaunch in May of this year.Disney and YouTube also announced another partnership earlier this month which aims to bring family-friendly original series to a co-branded YouTube channel. The content, according to reports, will include video drawn from relevant family-friendly content currently available across YouTube, original video produced by Disney, as well as a blend of current Disney Interactive original series, select Disney Channel programming and Disney user created content.The first series, which launches in February, will be based on a Disney mobile game (Wheres My Water) and its main character Swampy.
