At CES 2012, there are quite a few products that would totally change the way you do things (or at least save you some money) that just dont get enough coverage. We reported on Oomas new HD2 VoIP handset, but nothing beats getting the facts straight from the CEO of the company. Luckily, Eric Stang had a chance to meet with us and chat it up. He explained that, while unnecessary, the HD2 Revel pretty much eliminates the need for a land-line. Its basically a smartphone (or a smartphone-like handset) that pairs with the Ooma base station to offer VoIP services in your home. It also offers HD calling and caller ID with images collected from your Facebook, Google and Yahoo friends. The handset should be available in February at select retailers and Ooma.com for $60.
