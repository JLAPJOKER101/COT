This week the lads and I talk about the iPad Mini, our huge booth at CES, and my new favorite coffeemaker. We also discuss how much its going to cost us to interview 50 Cent at CES this year, which is pretty darn wild.Want to hear this in audio form? Ive extracted the audio from the video webcast and saved it to a downloadable MP3 podcast that you can subscribe to via RSS or iTunes. Hopefully you enjoy this version as well.
