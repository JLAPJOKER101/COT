Syrian security forces killed three people and arrested dozens in house-to-house raids on Tuesday in Homs, activists said. Homs, about 100 miles north of the capital, Damascus, has been a center of dissent since the popular uprising against President Bashar al-Assad began in March. An amateur video posted online showed an armored personnel carrier driving through Homs firing randomly. The leader of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights in London, who uses the pseudonym Rami Abdul-Rahman, said that two people were killed when troops opened fire on a car at a checkpoint, and a third died from a random bullet.
