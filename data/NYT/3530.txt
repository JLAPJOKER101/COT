The state prosecutor has issued international arrest warrants for four close allies of former President Laurent Gbagbo, including the notorious youth leader Charles Bl&eacute; Goud&eacute;. The others were Mr. Gbagbo&rsquo;s former spokesman, Ahoua Don Mello; the former industry minister, Philippe Attey; and the former ambassador to Israel, Raymond Koudou Kessie. Fifteen other members of Mr. Gbagbo&rsquo;s inner circle were charged last week.
