The Gillmor Gang — Robert Scoble, John Taschek, Kevin Marks, and Steve Gillmor — took advantage of the early rays of the new rising sun to record. It must have been fun to watch the caffeine kick in, but the show was half over before I arrived. Id been up late mourning the death of Flash, which finally received an auto-update from reality it couldnt refuse.Next for a wake-up call is Google+, which @scobleizer ripped a new one while continuing to insist it was just a matter of some filtering and expanded fan pages. Meanwhile its time to play with Amazon Fire, which the rest of the Gang has on order, and salesforce.coms new Do.com service, for which Ive obtained an invite code good for 500 uses. This show is rated G+.Produced and directed by Tina Chase Gillmor. Recorded live Monday, November 14, 2011.
