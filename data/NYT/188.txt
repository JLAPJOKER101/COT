TUNIS (Reuters) &mdash; The police fired into the air to disperse an unruly crowd in a Tunis suburb on Tuesday, as a wave of unrest over poverty and unemployment, in which officials say 23 civilians have died, hit the capital for the first time.        

In the working-class neighborhood of Ettadamen, hundreds of youths, who had blocked roads with burning tires and hurled stones at the police, tried to attack a government building. The police fired warning shots into the air and fired tear gas  to force people back from the building.
