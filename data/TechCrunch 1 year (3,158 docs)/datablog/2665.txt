Because Facebook Timeline is rolling out to the public in the coming weeks, Facebook brought in press last week to do a deep dive on this new visual way of organizing our online social lives.Because I (surprisingly) fit the press designation I sat down with the person primarily responsible for the Facebook Timeline, Facebook Product Manager and Drop.io co-founder Sam Lessin, as well as Facebooks Michael Kirkland last week.We went through every possible question I had about Timeline, except for maybe, Why doesnt Facebook think people will be hesitant to express negative events, like the death of a family member, on Facebook Timeline?. (I honestly didnt think about it at the time, but I think the answer would probably be that eventually well get used to expressing all milestones, whether negative or positive, through social media.)Because I find this kind of stuff fascinating, here is the entire interview above. And, because we posted Don Draper Pitches The Facebook Timeline earlier, I felt that it was only fair to give Lessin the same level of coverage or at least headline marquee space. Tout à lheure.
