An official at a Chinese government agency investigating a deadly high-speed rail crash in late July has said &ldquo;the accident should not have happened&rdquo; and that &ldquo;it could have been avoided and prevented,&rdquo; according to Xinhua, the state news agency.        

The official, Huang Yi, a spokesman for the State Administration of Work Safety, said in the Xinhua report, which appeared Tuesday, that the agency would find the people and businesses responsible. Mr. Huang reiterated an earlier conclusion by officials that the accident occurred because of faults in the signaling system, and said that there were also shortcomings in the emergency and safety management systems.        

In the city of Shenzhen, Ma Cheng, a 55-year-old manager and Communist Party official at the company that makes signals, died of a heart attack on Monday, according to a brief statement by the company, China Railway Signal & Communication Corporation.        

The crash occurred by the eastern city of Wenzhou and resulted in 40 deaths and 191 injuries. It also ignited an extraordinary firestorm of populist criticism on the Internet that forced the government to fire three officials in the Shanghai bureau of the Railways Ministry and move a much ridiculed ministry spokesman to a job in Poland.
