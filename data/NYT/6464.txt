GAZA &mdash; The Hamas movement celebrated the 24th anniversary of its founding on Wednesday by reasserting that it would never recognize Israel nor abandon violence.        

Tens of thousands of supporters watched the Hamas prime minister, Ismail Haniya, speak from a large outdoor stage in the shape of a ship with a model of Jerusalem&rsquo;s Al Aksa Mosque. Denying speculation that Hamas would turn its attention to nonviolent resistance, Mr. Haniya said: &ldquo;Today we say it clearly. Armed resistance and armed struggle are the strategic way to liberate the Palestinian land from the sea to the river.&rdquo;        

He was referring to all of Israel as well as to what his rivals in the Palestinian Authority want to become the state of Palestine &mdash; Gaza, the West Bank and East Jerusalem. He said Hamas had never said that &ldquo;Palestine is only Gaza, the West Bank and East Jerusalem.&rdquo; He hinted that should those areas be handed over by Israel, Hamas could take a &ldquo;temporary&rdquo; respite &ldquo;without Israel being recognized and without any concession being made.&rdquo;        

Next week, Israel and Hamas are to carry out the second part of a prisoner exchange in which an Israeli soldier was freed for more than 1,000 Palestinians.        

Political changes in Egypt, Tunisia and Libya augur well for Hamas&rsquo;s brand of Islamist politics, and the flags of those countries were present on the stage. The flag of Syria, where there is a popular revolt against President Bashar al-Assad and where the Hamas exiled leadership remains based, was absent.
