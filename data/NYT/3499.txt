Venezuela&rsquo;s government said it would postpone a summit meeting of Latin American leaders scheduled for next week because President Hugo Ch&aacute;vez was still recovering from surgery in Cuba. The Foreign Ministry said in a statement read Wednesday on state television that &ldquo;the president is in the middle of a recuperation process and very strict medical treatment.&rdquo; As a result, the statement said, the government had decided to postpone the two-day summit meeting of Latin American and Caribbean leaders that had been scheduled to begin next Tuesday. Confusion persists as to the president&rsquo;s condition, which the authorities have attributed to a pelvic abscess. On Tuesday, Cuban television showed photographs of Mr. Ch&aacute;vez with Fidel Castro.
