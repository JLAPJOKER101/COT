Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, returned to a British court on Tuesday in his fight against extradition to Sweden, where he has been accused of sexual abuse. Mr. Assange, left, nodded as his lawyers tried to persuade judges at the Royal Courts of Justice to overturn a previous decision that he return to Sweden to face the accusations, made by two women in Stockholm last year. Ben Emmerson, one of Mr. Assange&rsquo;s lawyers, said that his client&rsquo;s behavior in Sweden might have been &ldquo;disreputable, discourteous, disturbing,&rdquo; but that it did not constitute a crime under British law, rendering any Swedish arrest warrant invalid. The hearing will continue Wednesday.
