This is kind of handy  and just in time for TechCrunch Disrupt. The team at Lemon Labs just launched a new app called Hashtag App, which lets you follow Twitter hashtags on your iPhone or iPad. But there are a bunch of apps for that, including Twitter itself, you say? Very true. Thats why Hashtag App kicks things up a notch and supports Instagram hashtags as well. Fun!The app was designed for events and conferences (like #tcdisrupt, of course). However, you can use it to follow any hashtag of interest  not just those related to an event. Another nice thing about the app is that you dont have to log in to either Twitter or Instagram to use it. You just launch the app, enter a hashtag and go. The app uses the conventional pull-to-refresh feature, allowing you to update your hashtag-filled stream whenever you choose. It would be nice if there was a real-time option, like Streamboard, though. (Maybe in a later version?) When you want to change hashtags, you just click the X to head back to the homescreen. Nice. Im going to give it a go today from Disrupt and see how it holds up.The app creators are Lemon Labs, a self-described funky app production house working in startup mode from Vilnius, Lithuania, of all places. They presented the prototype last month at a tech startups conference for the most promising entrepreneurs of the Baltics and Scandinavia. The apps creators include Monika Katkute, Mindaugas Kuprionis, Marius Kazemekaitis, and Jonas Lekevicius.Katkute says they have not received outside funding, as the company has generated revenue from commercial projects theyve done before. However, theyre currently talking to potential investors in the Nordics.You can grab the app from iTunes here.
