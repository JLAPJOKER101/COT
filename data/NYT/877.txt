Hezbollah&rsquo;s leader told the group&rsquo;s members on Wednesday to be prepared to invade northern Israel if war breaks out. The comments illustrate the fragile situation along the Lebanese border since Israel and the Iranian-backed Hezbollah fought a six-week war there in the summer of 2006 that ended in a United Nations-brokered truce. &ldquo;I tell the holy warriors of the Islamic resistance to be ready for a day when, if war is imposed on us, your command might ask you to control the Galilee area,&rdquo; the leader, Hassan Nasrallah, above, said in a televised speech; &ldquo;the Galilee&rdquo; refers to northern Israel. In response, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel said no one should have any doubt about &ldquo;Israel&rsquo;s determination to defend itself.&rdquo;
