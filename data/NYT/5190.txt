Gunmen believed to be Sunni extremists fired on Shiite Muslims traveling through southwestern Pakistan on Tuesday, killing 12 people and wounding 6 in what was apparently a sectarian attack, the police said. The gunmen, riding motorbikes, stopped a bus carrying mostly Shiite Muslims who were headed to work at a vegetable market on the outskirts of Quetta, the capital of Baluchistan Province, said a police official, Hamid Shakeel. The attackers forced the people off the bus, made them stand in a line and then opened fire, Mr. Shakeel said. Eleven Shiites and one Sunni were killed, he said, and four Shiites and two Sunnis were wounded. Shiites are a minority in mainly Sunni Pakistan.
