		
They really are doing face-lifts younger and younger these days. It was just eight months ago in October 2011 when we first met Snip.it, a San Francisco-based startup that has created a web application for people to snip, collect, and comment on, and share their favorite articles from all over the web. But for Snip.it, its already high time for a makeover: Today the company is unveiling a top-to-bottom rebuild of its service with a faster, revamped user experience and a heaping handful of new features.So this week we were pleased to have the opportunity to interview Ramy Adeeb, Snip.its founder and CEO. Adeeb came by TechCrunch TV to give us a hands-on look at the brand new Snip.it and give us the rundown on his company. It still has that super trendy Pinterest-like pinboard layout its famously had since launch, but it actually has so much going on behind that interface that you forget the comparison as soon as you dive in. Watch the video embedded above to see Adeeb show off the Snip.it applications snappy new Backbone.js-powered page load structure, its truly addictive stats feature that shows you exactly how many people have viewed your collections and shared articles, 100+ brand new collection topic categories, custom page personalization features, as well as Snip.its new mobile-friendly web presence. We also got Adeeb to fill us in on where he sees Snip.it fitting in to the current landscape of other news sharing sites  from major social networks where people already share so much news such as Facebook and Twitter, to more focused content-reading and sharing plays such as Trap.it, Prismatic, and Wavii.
