President Hugo Ch&aacute;vez, celebrating his 12th anniversary in power, said he was prepared to campaign for six more years in office. In a televised speech, Mr. Ch&aacute;vez said that &ldquo;the battle has begun&rdquo; for the election in 2012. And in visits to a school and a state-run supermarket, he promoted his programs and agenda. He also apologized for errors, saying much remained to be done as he sought to lead Venezuela toward socialism. While the president is facing problems like rising crime and 27 percent inflation, the opposition has yet to select a candidate to run against him. A pollster, Luis Vicente Le&oacute;n, said Wednesday that Mr. Ch&aacute;vez&rsquo;s popularity had been hovering around 50 percent, down from more than 70 percent in 2006.
