BEIJING &mdash; China&rsquo;s railways ministry said Tuesday that it had dismissed its spokesman, whose statements after a high-speed train collision in eastern China last month became a target of public ridicule.        

China&rsquo;s state-run media, which reported the news, gave no reason for the dismissal of the ministry spokesman, Wang Yongping, the fourth ministry official to be fired since the July 23 accident near the city of Wenzhou, which killed 40 people and injured 191. But Mr. Wang&rsquo;s hapless performance in answering the media&rsquo;s questions about the crash appeared to be a likely explanation.        

Asked why rescuers had pulled a toddler out of the wreckage alive many hours after the rescue effort had been officially called off, Mr. Wang said it was &ldquo;a miracle of life.&rdquo;        

Asked why workers had buried a train car at the site of the accident before an official investigation had even begun, he said the wreckage had to be cleared to aid rescuers. &ldquo;Whether you believe it or not, I believe it anyway,&rdquo; he told reporters.        

The powerful railways ministry has been under fierce criticism over the disaster. Critics have called for an independent investigation of the collision and a complete overhaul of the ministry.        

Until the accident, the Chinese government had cited the ministry&rsquo;s high-speed rail network as an example of the country&rsquo;s growing technological sophistication and development. On Tuesday, the railways ministry acknowledged in a report on its Web site that management of the construction of high-speed rail was below standard. The authorities have blamed the Wenzhou crash on a design flaw in a railway signaling device.
