In another ominous sign of the heightened risks here for American troops as they prepare to withdraw from the country, two soldiers were killed Thursday by a roadside bomb that exploded close to a checkpoint at the United States&rsquo; military&rsquo;s largest base in Iraq, Victory Base Complex in Baghdad. American officials said the bomb was a device known as an E.F.P., which pierces armor. In June the American military suffered its most combat deaths in three years. Most of the attacks have been attributed to rockets fired at bases by Shiite militias. But Thursday&rsquo;s attack was jarring for American officials, as it struck near a checkpoint that is constantly guarded and under surveillance.
