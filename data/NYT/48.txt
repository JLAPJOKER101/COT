Greece is considering building a fence along a section of its border with Turkey that is the busiest transit point for illegal immigration in Europe, the minister of citizen protection said Monday. &ldquo;Greek society has exceeded its limit in its capacity to accommodate illegal immigrants,&rdquo; the minister, Christos Papoutsis, said in an interview posted on his Web site. &ldquo;Greece can no longer tolerate this.&rdquo; He said Greece also planned to upgrade its coast guard. In a separate statement, he said 128,000 immigrants had entered Greece illegally in 2010. Ministry officials said a final decision on the fence had not been made.
