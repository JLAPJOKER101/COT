PARIS &mdash; Pierre Moscovici, a Socialist legislator, is &ldquo;in mourning,&rdquo; he said in an interview, and so are the Socialists. With the shocking fall of Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the party leader who was arrested in New York on charges of sexual assault against a hotel housekeeper, the party is trying to pick up the pieces &mdash; and to pick a presidential candidate from an uninspiring set of choices.        

Mr. Moscovici was one of the closest allies of Mr. Strauss-Kahn, his former teacher, known as D.S.K. He was deeply involved in preparing the campaign that was expected to sweep Mr. Strauss-Kahn and the Socialists into the presidency next year for the first time since 1995.        

The Strauss-Kahnians, as his supporters are known, are unsure where to go after the loss of their champion. Mr. Moscovici, 53, a former minister for European affairs, is thinking about throwing his own hat into the ring, because he is not overwhelmed by the other candidates and to make sure the ideas of the center-left are heard.        

&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a shock, a human shock,&rdquo; he said of Mr. Strauss-Kahn&rsquo;s arrest. &ldquo;For us it&rsquo;s a new deal, and a more complicated one. There&rsquo;s no clear favorite, and there probably won&rsquo;t be.&rdquo;        

Even the support group called G&eacute;n&eacute;ration-D.S.K. has changed its name to the faceless and numerically challenged &ldquo;G&eacute;n&eacute;ration4G,&rdquo; which stands for G&eacute;n&eacute;ration Gagner, Gouverner &agrave; Gauche, or &ldquo;generation to win and govern on the left.&rdquo;        

To pick a candidate, the Socialists have scheduled a two-round primary for October. The only serious candidates so far, with the entry deadline coming soon, are Fran&ccedil;ois Hollande, 56, a legislator and former party leader, and his former partner, S&eacute;gol&egrave;ne Royal, 57, with whom he has four children and who lost the 2007 election to Nicolas Sarkozy.        

The current party leader, Martine Aubry, 60, announced her candidacy on Tuesday morning; she had a now-irrelevant agreement with Mr. Strauss-Kahn not to run against him. Mr. Hollande, who also runs the small departmental government of Corr&egrave;ze, is currently in the lead, according to opinion polls, and he has had the time to prepare himself &mdash; he has lost considerable weight &mdash; and his campaign, which was originally aimed at defeating Mr. Strauss-Kahn.        

But none of these candidates, or Mr. Moscovici himself, has the domestic or international stature that Mr. Strauss-Kahn had, and it is less clear that any of them will be able to appeal to centrist voters as he did. &ldquo;The battle is open, but the risk is to have a very divisive fight,&rdquo; Mr. Moscovici said. &ldquo;This is &lsquo;the narcissism of small differences,&rsquo; as Freud said. The candidates are really not so different.&rdquo;        

Making matters more complicated, the primary system the Socialists have outlined is odd, with any French person who states &ldquo;sympathy with the left&rdquo; being eligible to vote. Voters do not have to be party members or even registered to vote.        

The head of Mr. Sarkozy&rsquo;s party, Jean-Fran&ccedil;ois Cop&eacute;, has charged that the primaries are open to abuse, since records will be made of those who evince a sympathy for the left. The Socialists say those records will be destroyed within a week and accuse Mr. Cop&eacute; of making mischief. But Mr. Moscovici said he was more concerned that since anyone can vote, Mr. Cop&eacute; &ldquo;can send out a message to thousands of Sarkozy supporters&rdquo; telling them to vote for a weak Socialist candidate.        

It is early yet, with the presidential election scheduled for next May, but the opinion polls continue to show Mr. Sarkozy in a weak position in his effort to win a second five-year term. Both Mr. Hollande and Ms. Aubry would beat Mr. Sarkozy in a second-round runoff, and Ms. Royal would come close.        

&ldquo;The good news,&rdquo; Mr. Moscovici said, is that &ldquo;Sarkozy is still in terrible shape.&rdquo; Even after Mr. Strauss-Kahn&rsquo;s disappearance, &ldquo;people still reject Sarkozy and expect a new president,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Almost any Socialist defeats him.&rdquo;        

Still, he conceded, &ldquo;there is some new doubt among us and around us about whether in the end we will win this election.&rdquo; The Socialist campaign is dominated by Mr. Hollande and Ms. Aubry, he said, &ldquo;but no one clearly sees them as presidential.&rdquo;        

Mr. Sarkozy is a skillful campaigner, and while the French do not like him very much, they do like a number of his policies, including his management of the economic crisis and his leadership in the war to oust the Libyan leader, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi.        

Mr. Sarkozy is trying to consolidate the center-right behind him and see off potential candidates in the tricky first round of the election. The loss of Mr. Strauss-Kahn is considered to leave more room for a centrist candidate, and a divided center-right, given the strength of the far right National Front behind Marine Le Pen, could result in Mr. Sarkozy running third in the first round and being eliminated.        

But the same risk exists on the left, where numerous candidates from the Greens to the far left could divide the vote, pushing the Socialist candidate into third, which happened in 2002.        

While for the moment Mr. Sarkozy is most concerned with undermining the support for Ms. Le Pen, the easiest path for his re-election would be to run against her in the second round.        

For Mr. Moscovici, the temptation to run in the primaries is strong, but he fears further dividing the party. If Mr. Strauss-Kahn had decided not to run a year ago, Mr. Moscovici would have run, he said.        

For now, he has sent a set of policy ideas to Mr. Hollande and Ms. Aubry, who have both approached him for support, and he is weighing his choices.        

&ldquo;Above all, we need to have good primaries and a good debate,&rdquo; Mr. Moscovici said. &ldquo;And then we need to get together after the primaries and run a good campaign against a very good campaigner.&rdquo;
