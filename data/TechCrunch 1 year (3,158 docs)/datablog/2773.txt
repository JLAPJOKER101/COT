Fan relationship management service FanBridge is launching a new feature today, called the “Social Digest,” which gives influencers and brands a way to stay in touch with their fans and followers. The Social Digest automatically curates the most popular social content in an email digest distributed to fans on a weekly basis. FanBridge, which has raised funding from SoftTech VC, Lowercase Capital, 500 Startups, First Round Capital, Founder Collective, Grape Arbor VC, and Alex Zubillaga; helps bands, artists, sports teams, and even small businesses and brands manage their fan base through opt-in emails and sophisticated analytics. It manages more than 120 million fans via email alone.Using the foundation of FanBridge’s platform that analyzes the actions of more than 120 million email subscribers, 250 million Facebook fans and 80 million Twitter followers, Social Digest automatically pulls the most popular content of each brand. Clients only need to sync their social networks from their FanBridge account, and Social Digest will ensure the top stickiest content is seen each week by subscribers. In July, FanBridge started a private beta of Social Digest with select clients. The emails saw an 30% average open rate (compared to an average 15% for a general campaign), an 18% average click-through rate on social content (compared to an average 6% for a general campaign), and a 3% average click-through rate for ad/sponsor content (compared to an average 1% for a general campaign).
