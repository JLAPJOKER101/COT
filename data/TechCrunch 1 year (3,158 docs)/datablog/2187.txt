Correct me if Im wrong here but you werent always immediately prompted and guided through to finding your Gmail contacts on TwitterÂ upon login, just like you werent always able to sync your tweets to Facebook.Some switch just got turned on after midnight on Friday for me I swear because, yeah now this stuff is possible. Its crazy. Log into your Twitter account, go to Settings, click on your profile pic and its there, I promise. Unless Im hallucinating or part of some strange private beta. Which is totally possible seeing as though I write for TechCrunch and all.If it is true, this tripartite partnership is super interesting as all three of these companies dont really, um, get along on the social front. So Im all like, Look who decided to play all nice all of a sudden.Heh.
