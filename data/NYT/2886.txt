The director and 11 officials at a prison in northern Mexico were charged Friday with helping 17 inmates escape through a tunnel in the prison&rsquo;s laundry room. The federal prosecutor&rsquo;s office said the prison officials, in Reynosa, Tamaulipas, across from Texas, helped inmates escape through a hatch hidden underneath a washing machine. The tunnel emerged outside the prison grounds.
