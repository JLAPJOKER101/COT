JERUSALEM (AP) &mdash; Yuli Ofer, one of Israel&rsquo;s richest men, died Thursday at his home near Tel Aviv. He was 87.        

His death was announced by his family. It came three months after the death of his brother and longtime business partner, Sammy Ofer.        

The Ofer brothers built a business empire that included holdings in international shipping, real estate, chemicals and banking. They divided up their assets in recent years, but their joint worth has been estimated at $4 billion to $10 billion.        

Yehuda Ofer was born in Romania and emigrated to the British Mandate of Palestine with his family. He later fought in the Israeli Army. He and his brother entered the shipping business in the 1950s.        

This year the United States government imposed penalties on Sammy Ofer&rsquo;s company, the Ofer Brothers Group, for selling an oil tanker to Iran through a Singapore subsidiary, in violation of United States trade restrictions on Tehran.        

Shortly after that, Sammy Ofer died at the age of 89.        

The State Department on Tuesday removed the Ofer Holdings Group from the sanctions list, and the family was not considered responsible for the business decisions.
