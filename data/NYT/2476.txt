A young nationalist was sentenced to life in prison, Russia&rsquo;s most stringent punishment, on Friday for fatally shooting a human rights lawyer and a young journalist two years ago on a busy street near the Kremlin. His common-law wife, who prosecutors said acted as a lookout, was sentenced to 18 years as an accomplice. The sentence brings to a close a case that deeply shook Russian human rights circles, which have been dogged by a series of high-profile killings. Last week, the couple, Nikita Tikhonov, 30, and Yevgenia Khasis, 26, were found guilty. Defense lawyers appealed the sentence on Friday, saying the judge had sided with prosecutors. &ldquo;This can be qualified in whatever way you like, a costume ball, a farce, a reprisal, but not a trial,&rdquo; Aleksandr Vasilyev, Mr. Tikhonov&rsquo;s lawyer, told the Interfax news service.
