Kenya&rsquo;s government has lost its bid to block the prosecution of senior politicians before the International Criminal Court in The Hague. On Tuesday, appeals judges ruled that they had found insufficient evidence that Kenya&rsquo;s government was investigating the cases, as it had long claimed. The prosecutor has accused six Kenyans, including the deputy prime minister, two former ministers and a former police chief, of orchestrating large-scale violence after the 2007 elections. More than 1,200 people died and several hundred thousand fled their homes. The decision means that the next stage of the criminal proceedings, confirmation of charges, can go ahead in The Hague this week.
