The Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has announced that Hu Zhanfan is taking over as president of China Central Television, better known as CCTV, a state-run organization that is the largest television network in the country, according to a report by Xinhua, the state news agency. Mr. Hu was vice minister of the State Administration of Radio, Film and Television, an agency that regulates some of China&rsquo;s largest media industries and is widely thought to be conservative. The current head of CCTV, Jiao Li, will take a new position in the government, Xinhua reported on Thursday without giving more details. Mr. Jiao was appointed president of CCTV in May 2009, and before that served in the publicity department of the party&rsquo;s Central Committee. Since a policy meeting in October, Chinese leaders have been pushing for various changes and regulations in cultural industries, media organizations and the Internet.
