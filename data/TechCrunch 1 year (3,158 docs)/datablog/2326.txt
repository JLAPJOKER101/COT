Nokia is firmly a member of Team Microsoft. The Finnish telecommunication previously dumped most of its internal software OS development and in favor Microsofts Windows Phone 7 system. But Nokia is seemingly jumping on another Microsoft platform bandwagon: Windows 8.Paul Amsellem, Nokia’s French general manager, recently sat down with French Newspaper Les Echos. The interview of course covered the firms recently-announced Windows Phone 7 handsets but Amsellem also brought up the Windows 8 Tablet. In June 2012, we will have a tablet that runs on Windows 8,” he said. That echos Nokia CEO Stephen Elop recent statements that the company sees a new opportunity in an upcoming tablet. The user experience of Windows 8 is essentially a supercharged version of the Nokia Lumia experience that you saw on stage today. And you see the parallels and opportunity for commonality from a user perspective. You say wow, this is more than just smartphones, there’s a broader opportunity here. And clearly we see that broader opportunity as well, without specifically commenting on what that may mean in the future.This isnt Nokias first go at a tablet. The company long talked about a tablet that would compete with the iPad. However, with Nokias mobile platforms floundering in the marketplace and Meego not feeling love from developers, the company seemingly decided not to out a tablet. Windows 8 is a perfect fit.Nokia clearly sees its future with Microsoft. The company missed the wild and crazy early days of Android. Microsoft then made the decision to develop WinPhones easy by offering a billion dollars up front. As Elop pointed out, theres a clear similarity between Nokias new phones and the Windows 8 user interface. If Nokia works it right, the company could quickly become the favorite within Microsofts entourage. And thats a great place to be.
