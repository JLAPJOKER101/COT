Bahrain has ordered the public prosecutor to investigate death and torture cases implicating the police as part of efforts at political reconciliation after a crackdown on pro-democracy protests this year. Interior Minister Rashed bin Abdullah al-Khalifa ordered that &ldquo;all cases related to deaths, torture and inhumane treatment implicating police&rdquo; be referred to the prosecutor, the state news agency said Thursday. The report said the measures followed the recommendations of a commission, set up by the government, that investigated the unrest.
