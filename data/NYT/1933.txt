A Russian border guard and two Georgians were killed in a shootout in Abkhazia, a breakaway Georgian territory, Russia&rsquo;s Federal Security Service said Friday. Russian border guards were inspecting an abandoned house when they were attacked, a spokesman told the Interfax news service. The security service said the two Georgians had been identified as officers from the Georgian Interior Ministry. A spokesman for Georgia&rsquo;s Interior Ministry denied that, saying one of the Georgians had been wanted by the police and the other was an area resident. Russian guards began patrolling the boundaries of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, a second enclave, after the 2008 war between Georgia and Russia over the territories.
