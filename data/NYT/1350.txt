Arguments in the more than three-year-long war crimes trial of Charles Taylor, the former Liberian president, ended Friday at a United Nations-backed court in The Hague. The case against the first African president to face an international tribunal has been the scene of much courtroom drama and multiple delays as the defense dragged out proceedings, ignoring deadlines and staging several boycotts. Mr. Taylor, 62, was indicted while in office in 2003 and charged with large-scale atrocities committed by rebels under his command. Mr. Taylor has denied the charges and dismissed his trial as a political event. If he is found guilty, he will serve his sentence in a British jail. The three international judges are expected to take months before delivering their verdict.
