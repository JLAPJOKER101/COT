After initially denying allegations of sexual abuse at three Quebec schools it operated, a Roman Catholic order said Thursday that it had settled a class-action lawsuit by the victims with a $17 million payment. In addition to the payment, the Congregation of Holy Cross issued a formal apology. The settlement covers incidents from 1950 to 2001, mostly at an elite Montreal boarding school formerly run by the order, which also controls the University of Notre Dame in Indiana. A separate criminal investigation by the police is continuing.
