Rights activists on Friday accused guards at a Cairo prison of killing an inmate by forcing water into his body with hoses, a case they say shows the continued use of torture by security forces since the ouster of President Hosni Mubarak. The inmate, Essam Atta, 23, had called his family before his death to say that the police had injected water into his mouth and anus, his family&rsquo;s lawyer said. Other prisoners told the lawyer that Mr. Atta vomited blood and died after the torture. A security official denied the allegations, saying Mr. Atta had taken drugs and was suffering from exhaustion. Mr. Atta was pronounced dead at a Cairo hospital on Thursday.
