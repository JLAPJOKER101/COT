President Obama has revised a Bush administration plan from 2004 that would have halved the number of Army combat units deployed in Europe, and will instead retain three of the four brigades. Stationing three brigade combat teams in Europe beyond 2015 will allow the American military &ldquo;to maintain a flexible and rapidly deployable ground force&rdquo; in support of NATO, as well as to &ldquo;meet a broad range of 21st century challenges,&rdquo; the Pentagon said Friday in a statement. A brigade traditionally has 3,000 to 5,000 soldiers.
