BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) &mdash; Arab states may take their initiative for ending Syria&rsquo;s crackdown on protests to the United Nations Security Council next week unless Damascus agrees to carry out the measure, Qatar&rsquo;s foreign minister said Saturday.        

Expressing frustration that Syria had not carried out the plan, six weeks after it was first agreed, the foreign minister, Sheik Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabr al-Thani, said the window for an Arab solution to the crisis was closing. &ldquo;If this matter is not solved in the weeks ahead, or couple of months, it will no longer be in Arab control,&rdquo; he told journalists after an Arab ministerial committee meeting in Qatar. He said Arab ministers would vote on Wednesday about whether to ask the Security Council to approve the initiative.        

Syria has conditionally approved a plan to send monitors to oversee the carrying out of the Nov. 2 Arab League initiative, which calls on President Bashar al-Assad to withdraw the army from urban areas, release political prisoners and hold talks with opponents.
