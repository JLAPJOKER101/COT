A government agency in Beijing has said it will investigate a company that tried to open a luxury private club inside the Forbidden City, according to a report on the Web site of People&rsquo;s Daily, the official newspaper of the Chinese Communist Party. The agency, the Beijing Administration of Industry and Commerce, is looking into wrongdoing by the Forbidden City Cultural Development Company, which had been charged by the palace&rsquo;s management office with organizing salons and lectures. Instead, the company began handing out &ldquo;membership sign-up forms&rdquo; without telling the managers, a palace spokesman said. The company reportedly wanted to sign up 500 members at a charge of one million renminbi each, or about $154,000.
