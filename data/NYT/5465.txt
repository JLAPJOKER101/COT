Italy&rsquo;s interior minister, under fire over Rome&rsquo;s worst riots in years, said on Tuesday that the country risked a &ldquo;hot autumn&rdquo; of unrest and promised tough new measures to bolster police powers against violent protests. In a report to the upper house of Parliament, the minister, Roberto Maroni, denied accusations that he had failed to take adequate measures to prevent Saturday&rsquo;s riots and said the real problem was a lack of legal powers and resources for the police. He said the riots, in which cars and police vehicles were burned and at least one building set on fire, had caused $7 million in damage.
