Myanmar has denied it had been cooperating with North Korea on nuclear weapons technology, the first time it has commented on such speculation. The weekly newspaper Pyi Myanmar quoted the Parliament speaker, Thura Shwe Mann, as telling reporters last week that the armed forces of the two countries cooperated militarily, but &ldquo;it was not on nuclear cooperation as is being alleged.&rdquo; The newspaper said he made the comments after meeting with Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton. Mrs. Clinton, who visited Myanmar last week, publicly called on Myanmar to &ldquo;sever illicit ties to North Korea,&rdquo; which officials said had included work on ballistic missiles and, possibly, nuclear technology.
