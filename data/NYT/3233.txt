The police say they have found the dismembered remains of two bodyguards of a northern state&rsquo;s governor. Investigators say they believe that the bodyguards, who worked for Gov. Rodrigo Medina of Nuevo Le&oacute;n State, were killed by a drug gang. Their bodies were found Wednesday at an intersection in Guadalupe, a suburb of the state capital, Monterrey. Mr. Medina confirmed that the men were his bodyguards. He told reporters that &ldquo;no message, no threat will stop us from achieving a safe Nuevo Le&oacute;n.&rdquo;        

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;The area has been a scene of constant killings and reprisals since a rupture between the Gulf and Zeta cartels in late 2009. There have been frequent attacks on the police, and last August the mayor of the town of Santiago was kidnapped and killed.
