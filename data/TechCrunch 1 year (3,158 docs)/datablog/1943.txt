Many of you may remember that I was straight-up infatuated with Samsungs MV800 point-and-shoot. And why wouldnt I be? Its absolutely the best point-and-shoot if your favorite subject to shoot happens to be yourself. While Samsungs latest camera isnt quite as narcissistic, the new DV300F announced today still has a pretty awesome trick up its sleeve. This is one of Samsungs Dual-View offerings, meaning it sports a 1.5-inch screen up front to accompany the usual 3-inch LCD display (which doubles as a viewfinder.) What sets the DV300F apart, however, is its WiFi capabilities. Youll be able to share pics and clips directly to Facebook, Picasa, YouTube, etc. If youre not in the mood to go public right away, youll also be able to upload the entirety of your SD card to your PC with the Auto PC Backup tool. The 16-megapixel camera is capable of 5x optical zoom and comes equipped with a 25mm wide-angle lens. Youll also find the expected microSD slot present. Color flavors include black, silver, navy and red and each can be had for $199. Shipping is expected to begin in March.
