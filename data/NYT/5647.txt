The moderate Islamist party Ennahda won a 41 percent plurality in Tunisia&rsquo;s first free election, election officials said Thursday. Ennahda was the only Islamic or religious party competing in the vote on Sunday, the first election of the Arab Spring, meaning that a majority of Tunisians cast their votes for secular parties. Winning 90 of 217 seats in the constituent assembly, Ennahda will lead the formation of a new coalition government and name its prime minister, and it will also have the loudest voice in the assembly as it writes a new constitution. The runner-up, the liberal Congress for the Republic, founded by the veteran human rights advocate Moncef Marzouki, will have 30 seats.
