Seven Estonians riding bicycles in the Bekaa Valley of Lebanon were kidnapped by masked gunmen on Wednesday, security sources said. They said masked gunmen in a black Mercedes and white vans kidnapped the foreigners on a road between Zahle, a mostly Christian town, and Kfar Zabed, a mixed Sunni-Christian town. The cyclists had apparently crossed into Lebanon from Syria. Shadowy groups linked to Hezbollah kidnapped dozens of Western hostages in Beirut in the 1980s during Lebanon&rsquo;s civil war. But instances of kidnapping have been rare since then.
