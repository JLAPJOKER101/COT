A British protester who threw a plate of foam at Rupert Murdoch during a parliamentary hearing into the phone hacking scandal pleaded guilty to assault on Friday. The protester, Jonathan May-Bowles, 26, left, a comedian who uses the stage name Jonnie Marbles, will be sentenced on Tuesday. Speaking to reporters outside the London court, Mr. May-Bowles said, &ldquo;I would just like to say this has been the most humble day of my life,&rdquo; parroting almost verbatim Mr. Murdoch&rsquo;s words to the parliamentary committee last week.
