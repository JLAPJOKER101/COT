Kyrgyzstan&rsquo;s security agency said on Tuesday that it had stopped a plot by Islamist radicals to disrupt the presidential election on Oct. 30 and sow chaos in the country&rsquo;s volatile southern region. The election pits nationalist candidates from the south against Prime Minister Almazbek Atambayev, who has forged warm ties with Russia. The agency, the State Committee on National Security, said it had killed one of the Islamist plotters and detained 11 others, all members of a group that the government said was linked to Al Qaeda.
