Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda on Monday named a former cabinet spokesman, who became the government&rsquo;s public face during the crisis at the Fukushima nuclear power plant in the spring, to the cabinet post responsible for overseeing the response to the nuclear disaster. The former spokesman, Yukio Edano, was named trade minister, who is in charge of energy policy, among other things. The prime minister was trying to limit the damage to his new cabinet after the previous trade minister, Yoshio Hachiro, was forced to step down after only eight days, because of news reports that he joked with reporters about radiation from the Fukushima plant during a trip to the affected area.
