Cant get your Angry Birds done on just one iPad? Are you what would be commonly termed a Bluetooth-toting dbag? Do you think youre more important than most people? Do your co-workers (or employees) hate you? Heres the double iPad case of your dreams.Made by a small case manufacturer, ZooGue, the double iPad case is launching tomorrow and should be the toast of the country club come Monday. After all, you cant GTL if youre not connected to your homies back at the home office on your two red-hot iPads!No price yet, but if I were ZooGue Id add a certain premium for the man  or woman  who has it all and wants just a titch more. Slap some Ed Hardy art on there and youve got a trifecta.
