SINGAPORE (AP) &mdash; Singapore&rsquo;s founding father, Lee Kuan Yew, resigned from the cabinet on Saturday, ceding leadership to a younger generation after his party&rsquo;s worst election result since independence in 1965.        

Mr. Lee and another ex-prime minister, Goh Chok Tong, said in their joint resignation statement that they wanted to clear the path for younger leaders.        

&ldquo;A younger generation wants to be more engaged in the decisions which affect them,&rdquo; they said. &ldquo;After a watershed general election, we have decided to leave the cabinet and have a completely younger team of ministers to connect to and engage with this young generation.&rdquo;        

Mr. Lee has been in Singapore&rsquo;s cabinet since 1959. He was prime minister from 1959 to 1990, when Mr. Goh took over until 2004. He still has a seat in Parliament, and his son, Lee Hsien Loong, 59, remains prime minister.        

Mr. Lee&rsquo;s People&rsquo;s Action Party won 60 percent of the vote in the May 7 election, down from 67 percent in 2006 and 75 percent in 2001. The Workers Party won six seats, the most the opposition has held since independence.        

While winning 81 of 87 Parliament seats would be a good showing in most countries, the People&rsquo;s Action Party has governed Singapore almost as a one-party state, and the vote signaled that voters were seeking more accountability and responsiveness from their leaders.        

After the election, ruling party leaders said they were surprised at the level of resentment some voters felt toward the government for its perceived arrogance.        

Singapore, an island in Southeast Asia, is one of the world&rsquo;s richest countries, but soaring housing prices and a surge of foreign workers have left poorer Singaporeans struggling.
