ROME &mdash; A court in Milan on Tuesday refused to indict Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi in a tax fraud and embezzlement case that focused on the acquisition of TV rights by his family&rsquo;s media company, Mediaset.        

&ldquo;Mr. Berlusconi has been recognized as not involved in the case,&rdquo; his lawyer, Niccol&ograve; Ghedini, told reporters.        

The judge reviewing the case, however, decided to indict Mr. Berlusconi&rsquo;s eldest son and Mediaset&rsquo;s deputy chairman, Pier Silvio Berlusconi, along with the Mediaset chairman, Fedele Confalonieri, and other defendants in the case.        

Mr. Berlusconi now has three pending trials in Milan. Accusations include tax fraud, corruption and paying for sex with a minor. The tax fraud accusation refers to Mediaset&rsquo;s purchase of film rights at what prosecutors say were inflated prices. In another trial, Mr. Berlusconi is charged with bribing David Mills, a British lawyer, to lie in court to protect him. In the most recent trial, Mr. Berlusconi was accused of paying for sex with an underage Moroccan woman.        

Mr. Berlusconi denies any wrongdoing in the cases.
