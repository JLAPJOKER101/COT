TouchPal is a mobile app that helps you keep in touch with your contacts, namely by adding social aspects to your current contact list. Although much of TouchPals functionality has been replicated in other systems. However, TouchPal has improved things by merging nearly all of them into one app.TouchPal adds availability flags to your contact list and maintains contact information right inside the app. It also allows you to update your information and the change is propagated out to your friends phones. You can also create status messages and mark busy people to call them back automatically.
		Its a fairly interesting product in that it offers a great deal of real functionality in a fairly easy-to-use package. The rub? Touchpal will have to convince a critical mass of users to swap out their dialers and contact systems with the TouchPal package.The app runs on Android and iOS and the team hopes to monetize by becoming the de facto contact management system on many phones.This slideshow requires JavaScript.
