Sincerely, the maker of mobile apps that let you send your photos as print postcards, is pushing out a new version of its Sincerely Ink app today. The main change is that the theme now features Valentines Day cards, as well as other themes like Birthdays or New Years. Not huge news in and of itself, but get ready for many more updates like this  the Christmas season went so well for the company that its doubling down on holiday editionsIts largest mobile app, Postagram (a regular top app in the iTunes photo app category) saw 39% of its users also install and send a card using the Sincerely Ink app, founder Matt Brezina tells me. Postagram also lets you mail high-quality print versions of phone photos, and it could theoretically also be used during the holidays. So, the cross-promotion number means that lots of users are serious about themed cards for special occasions, and that Sincerelys theme changes are hitting home with them.The Ink app includes 20 Valentines Day-themed cards, although there are also new Thank You and Birthday cards available now. Brezina says theyre adding more designs all the time without the app itself needing to be updated. Customization options include photo filters and a section for including a personalized message. Cards cost $1.99 for a glossy 57 inch photo print, including postage in the US, Canada and the UK. Photos ship within 3 to 7 days. In other parts of the world, the price goes up by a dollar, and mailing can take up to a few weeks. The app is available for iOS and Android devices.
