JERUSALEM &mdash; Israel&rsquo;s military attach&eacute; in Russia was expelled this week on suspicion of spying, the Israeli Defense Ministry announced on Wednesday, adding that its own investigation into the allegations had found them to be baseless.        

The announcement did not name the attach&eacute;, but he was identified by Israeli news media as Vadim Leiderman, an air force colonel born in the Soviet Union with a doctorate in engineering from the Technion in Haifa.        

A statement released by the Defense Ministry said that Mr. Leiderman was scheduled to end his post in two months and that after an exhaustive inquiry, the Israelis had found that the allegations against him were without foundation. Israel&rsquo;s Channel 1 said he had been arrested while sitting in a cafe with a Russian and was suspected of managing several local residents as informants.
