At least 11 more bodies have been found in Veracruz, two days after gunmen dumped 35 bodies on a busy avenue there, a Mexican official said Friday. The official said the bodies were discovered Thursday. It was not clear who dumped them, or whether the attacks were related. Officials believe the attack on Tuesday was carried out by the New Generation drug gang, which is challenging the dominant Zetas gang in Veracruz state.
