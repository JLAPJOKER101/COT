Taboola, a service that powers many of the video recommendation widgets you find across the web, has raised a $9 million Series B funding round. The round is being led by Crescent Point, which is based in New York and Asia, as well as Evergreen VC, which has participated in previous rounds.This round brings Taboolas total funding to $15 million (it previously raised a $4.5 million round in November 2008, and a $1.5 million round in November 2007).Taboola gives publishers a turn-key product for offering recommendations on whatever video platform theyre using (its integrated with Brightcove, Ooyala, and other services). This is actually easier said than done — surfacing related videos is hard enough, and then theres the matter of gauging whether theyre videos people will actually want to watch. Thats Taboolas speciality, and its landed plenty of notable clients, including the New York Times, USA Today, CNN, and Bloomberg.The service does extensive analytics on the performance of each video, generating a score for each called EngageRank  (it also tries to tailor the recommendations to each user).  And that often leads to more clicks — the company says it drives as much as 2.5 times as much video watching on Bloomberg.Alongside the funding, the company is announcing a new milestone: the service now generates 250 million recommendations per day across its publisher partner sites.
