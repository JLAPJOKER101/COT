President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono has appointed his brother-in-law as army chief. The brother-in-law, Lt. Gen. Pramono Edhie Wibowo, who was sworn in Thursday, was formerly the chief of the army&rsquo;s strategic command. He had also led a team of the army&rsquo;s notoriously violent commando unit, Kopassus, that was deployed in East Timor before its independence. In 2008, he was assigned to lead Kopassus. The United States severed ties with the Indonesian military over the crackdown in East Timor. It lifted the ban in 2005 but kept restrictions against Kopassus until a year ago under a law banning American training for foreign military units accused of human rights violations. The appointment has raised speculation that Mr. Yudhoyono, who is constitutionally barred from a third term, would nominate General Wibowo, 56, as a presidential candidate in 2014.
