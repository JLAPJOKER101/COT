The Mexican Army has ordered three junior officers and 10 soldiers to stand trial on drug trafficking and organized crime charges after they were reportedly caught with more than a ton of methamphetamine and 66 pounds of cocaine. The military announced earlier that several soldiers were arrested last week with drugs at a military checkpoint south of Tijuana, across the border from San Diego. It was not clear whether it was the same group named in the charges announced Thursday. The Defense Department said in a statement it would &ldquo;in no way tolerate&rdquo; such acts. The troops were charged within the military justice system. Corruption is widespread among the Mexican police, and some experts worry it could spread to the tens of thousands of soldiers assigned to fight drug traffickers.
