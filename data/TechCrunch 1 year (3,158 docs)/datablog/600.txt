If you liked the larger photos that Facebook introduced to its mobile news feed last month, heres some good news: Its bringing a similar redesign to its Web interface.Specifically, Facebook says photos in the news feed will now be enlarged to up to 2x their previous size, and displayed in a new layout that can bring more photos from an album into the feed. Text in news feed posts is also going to be larger and wider spaced.At the time of the mobile redesign, we said Facebook was taking a cue from Instagram, and that the change could make browsing the mobile news feed a less tiring experience. Looks like Facebook wanted to improve the Web experience in the same way, making the news feed more of an enjoyable photo viewer on its own, rather than something that just points you to a photo album elsewhere on the site.This change will be rolling out gradually, starting today, Facebook says. So if youre squinting at the newsfeed and thinking something looks different, well, youre right. And if you arent seeing any changes yet, just wait — again, its a gradual rollout, and probably wont be live for many users for several days.
