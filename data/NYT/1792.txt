Hundreds of North African migrants fled a camp in southern Italy on Friday. The migrants, mostly from Tunisia, had been transferred from the overcrowded island of Lampedusa into a tent camp in the southern Italian town of Manduria. About 22,000 people have arrived on the island since January in what Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi called a &ldquo;human tsunami.&rdquo; Italy has asked other European nations to share the burden and take in some of the migrants.
