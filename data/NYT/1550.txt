Two European Parliament lawmakers have resigned and a third has stepped down from his position in his party after a British newspaper reported they had agreed to propose legislation in return for bribes. The Sunday Times reported this weekend that the former Austrian interior minister Ernst Strasser, above, the former Slovenian foreign minister Zoran Thaler, and the former Romanian deputy prime minister Adrian Severin had agreed to put forward amendments in the European Parliament in exchange for money. The newspaper had conducted an investigation in which its reporters posed as lobbyists. Mr. Strasser and Mr. Thaler have resigned from the Parliament, and Mr. Severin quit his position as deputy chairman of his party in Romania. All three dispute the allegations.
