A senior United Nations official said Friday that 5,000 former combatants remained in Sri Lankan camps 21 months after the civil war ended. Neil Buhne, speaking in Geneva on his last day as the head of the United Nations mission in Sri Lanka, said they were believed to be loyalists to the Tamil Tiger rebels, which were defeated in May 2009. He said that they remained  in camps beyond the reach of United Nations and Red Cross officials and that 18,000 other Tamils were in so-called welfare centers because of land mines.
