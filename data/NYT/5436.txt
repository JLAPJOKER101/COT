Seven opposition candidates who took part in the presidential election asked the Supreme Court on Monday to annul the Oct. 9 vote and call a fresh one within six months. They warned that if their demand was not met, their supporters would take to the streets in protest. The results have not yet been announced, but the incumbent, Paul Biya, was widely expected to be re-elected.
