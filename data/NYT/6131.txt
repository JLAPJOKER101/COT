President Yahya Jammeh of Gambia secured a new five-year term on Friday after the election commission declared him the winner in a vote that regional leaders said was marked by the intimidation of voters and the opposition. Mr. Jammeh, the former leader of a coup in 1994, took 72 percent of the vote, according to the Independent Electoral Commission chairman. His victory was seen by many analysts as a foregone conclusion in the West African nation, which is regularly accused by rights groups of repression.
