Most investors are expecting a record quarter for Apple, and three new surveys out today are adding to the evidence. Taken together with exciting recent rumors, like the one that Apple might open stores within Target stores, its not surprising to see analysts falling over themselves to upgrade their estimates ahead of Apples Q1 earnings call on January 24th.First off, NPD Group says that iOS devices made up 43% of US sales in October and November versus 26% in the previous quarter. Android sales, meanwhile, fell from 60% to 47% over the same period.A key reason for the latest iOS sales is that Apple began selling the new iPhone 4S and reduced costs for older models in the last three months of 2011. Many analysts had been expecting higher sales over the last part of the summer, and were taken off-guard by Apples decision to push the launch to later in the year. As the TechCrunch Apple Group noted over the weekend, if you sold your Apple stock after the company missed earnings estimates in October, you were, in fact, an idiot.
