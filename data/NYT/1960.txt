IBADAN, Nigeria (AP) &mdash; Despite bomb attacks and communal violence, voters put their inked fingers to ballots Saturday for the first round in the nation&rsquo;s crucial April election.        

Poll workers jammed into rickety commercial buses and cars to travel to the roughly 120,000 polling stations, most of which opened at noon for the nation&rsquo;s estimated 73.5 million voters.        

But in Maiduguri, where a radical Muslim sect known as Boko Haram has been blamed for violence, witnesses said gunmen killed a local politician with the All Nigeria People&rsquo;s Party and set a hotel on fire. Later, a spokesman for the National Emergency Management Agency said that at least one person was killed and several were wounded by a bomb that exploded near a polling station in Maiduguri.        

The election was for the National Assembly. The positions are highly lucrative, with hefty salaries and benefits and the ability to direct a swollen budget in a nation where billions in oil revenues routinely go missing.        

The vote was set for a week ago, but the national election chairman stopped it because ballots and tally sheets were missing in many polling places. About 15 percent of the races will not be held Saturday because of misprinted ballots.        

Nigeria, Africa&rsquo;s most populous nation with 150 million people, has had flawed elections since it became a democracy in 1999. The country closed its borders on Friday, and officials promised to increase security. But a bombing on Friday at an election office in Niger State near the country&rsquo;s capital killed at least eight people and wounded more than two dozen others.
