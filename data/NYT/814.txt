BANGKOK &mdash; The Australian editor of an English-language newspaper that publishes in Myanmar has been arrested and jailed in what an associate said Saturday was part of a business dispute.        

The editor, Ross Dunkley, founded the newspaper, The Myanmar Times, in 2000, and it is the only publication in the tightly controlled country to have foreign investors. It is published weekly in  English and Burmese.        

His associate, David Armstrong, said Mr. Dunkley was arrested on Thursday as he returned from a business trip abroad and accused of violating immigration laws. He is being held in Insein Prison pending a hearing on Feb. 24, Mr. Armstrong said.        

He said the arrest coincided with &ldquo;tense and protracted discussions&rdquo; between Mr. Dunkley and the paper&rsquo;s local partners about the company, its ownership and senior leadership positions.        

Mr. Armstrong is Mr. Dunkley&rsquo;s partner in a separate newspaper venture, The Phnom Penh Post in Cambodia.
