Bolivia and the United States agreed Monday to restore full diplomatic ties, three years after Bolivia expelled the American ambassador and the Drug Enforcement Administration. The two nations signed a joint framework agreement in Washington to normalize relations. A United States official said they planned to exchange ambassadors as soon as possible. The Bolivian government said the agreement was signed by Deputy Foreign Minister Juan Carlos Alurralde and a senior State Department official, Maria Otero. A United States official said the agreement did not specify whether American drug agents could return to Bolivia, a major cocaine-producing nation.
