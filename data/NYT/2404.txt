Dozens of bodies littered the streets of a neighborhood in Abidjan on Tuesday as fighting continued between government troops and the remnants of a militia loyal to the deposed leader, Laurent Gbagbo. Franck Kodjo, an official at the International Committee of the Red Cross, said the group had recovered 40 bodies in two hours.
