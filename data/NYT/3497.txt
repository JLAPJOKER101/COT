Former President Lee Teng-hui, one of the towering figures of modern Taiwanese politics, was indicted Thursday on an embezzlement charge. Mr. Lee, 88, and his top aide, Liu Tai-ying, are accused of embezzling $7.79 million from a secret diplomatic fund, the prosecutor Chen Hong-ta said. In a statement, prosecutors said Mr. Lee had embezzled the money from a National Security Bureau fund to set up a think tank meant to serve his private office after he left political life. Mr. Lee served as president from 1988 to 2000, and was elected in Taiwan&rsquo;s first popular presidential election in 1996. Prosecutors said they began looking into the case after Mr. Lee stepped down in 2000. Mr. Lee has repeatedly denied embezzling any of the bureau&rsquo;s funds. His office had no immediate comment Thursday but said his lawyers would hold a news conference later in the day. Another former Taiwanese president, Chen Shui-bian, is serving 17 years on corruption charges.
