A human rights group filed claims on Tuesday seeking at least $250 million in damages from the United Nations and its peacekeeping force in Haiti on behalf of 5,000 cholera victims. The group, the Institute for Justice and Democracy in Haiti, accuses the peacekeeping force, known as Minustah, of inadequate troop screening and improper sanitation that, the group said, had caused Haiti&rsquo;s cholera epidemic. More than 6,600 people have died and nearly a half-million more have been sickened since the cholera outbreak began in October 2010. The group also seeks establishment of a forum to hear its claims, which were filed with Minustah&rsquo;s claims office in Port-au-Prince. United Nations peacekeeping missions generally have immunity from actions in national courts. A spokesman for the United Nations Department of Peacekeeping Operations said the agency would have no comment until it had studied the claim.
