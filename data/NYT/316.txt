The talks scheduled for Friday between Iran and the five permanent Security Council members plus Germany should lead to &ldquo;comprehensive cooperation&rdquo; to address regional problems, Mohammad Khazaee, the Iranian ambassador to the United Nations, said at a news conference. Although previous Iranian attempts to shift the focus away from its nuclear program prompted objections from other negotiators, Mr. Khazaee said the talks, in Istanbul,  could lead to cooperation on problems like disarmament and the Arab-Israeli conflict. Mr. Khazaee said the West and other powers should stop making the mistake of ignoring Iran&rsquo;s status as the regional &ldquo;heavyweight.&rdquo;
