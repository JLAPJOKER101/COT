The general prosecutor&rsquo;s office on Monday said that it had reopened another criminal case against Yulia V. Tymoshenko, the opposition leader and a former prime minister. Ms. Tymoshenko is already serving a seven-year sentence on charges that have been condemned in the West as politically motivated. The reopened case, which dates back 15 years to her tenure as head of United Energy Systems of Ukraine, alleges that she embezzled about $3 million from the federal budget and evaded paying about $2.5 million in taxes. The case was closed in 2005, after Ms. Tymoshenko became prime minister. The announcement further dims hopes that she will be released and allowed to take part in 2012 parliamentary elections, which European leaders have said is a precondition for completing free trade and association agreements between Ukraine and the European Union.
